# `=this.name`

**Type:** `Zang Fu`
**Nature:** `Mixed Excess-Deficiency` | `Hot`
**Location:** `Interior`

## 📋 Overview

Upper Burner Lung Heat (Qi Level) is a common TCM pattern characterized by the presence of Heat in the Lung, affecting its function of governing Qi and respiration. This pattern often arises from the invasion of external Wind-Heat, although internal factors such as improper diet or emotional stress can also contribute. The Heat consumes Lung fluids and impairs the Lung's ability to descend Qi, leading to symptoms like fever, cough, breathlessness, and thirst. It is crucial to differentiate this pattern from other Lung conditions to provide appropriate treatment.

This pattern signifies that the pathogenic influence has moved beyond the superficial Wei Level and is now affecting the Qi Level, indicating a deeper involvement and requiring stronger therapeutic interventions. Understanding the interplay of Excess (Heat) and Deficiency (Lung fluids) is essential in formulating an effective treatment strategy that addresses both aspects of the pattern.

## 🏷️ Pattern Classification

**System:** `Zang Fu`
**Subtype:** `Lung`

**Eight Principles Analysis:**
- Excess/Deficiency: `Mixed Excess-Deficiency`
- Hot/Cold: `Hot`
- Interior/Exterior: `Interior`
- Yin/Yang: `Yin`

---

## 🌱 Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
- External Wind-Heat Invasion
- Diet (Excessive consumption of spicy, greasy, or fried foods)
- Emotional stress, leading to Qi stagnation and Heat transformation
- Pre-existing Lung Yin Deficiency making the Lung more susceptible to Heat
- Exposure to dry environments which damage Lung fluids
- Overwork, depleting Qi and Yin, creating an environment for Heat to arise

### Pathomechanisms
- External Wind-Heat invades the Lung and transforms into Heat at the Qi level. The Heat consumes Lung fluids, leading to dryness and impaired Lung function.
- Stagnant Qi due to emotional factors generates Heat in the Lung. The Heat further obstructs Lung Qi and impairs its descending function.
- Overconsumption of hot and spicy foods generates internal Heat which accumulates in the Lung. This Heat damages the Lung's ability to regulate fluids, leading to the formation of Phlegm.

**Development:**
The pattern often begins with the invasion of external Wind-Heat. If the body's Wei Qi is unable to expel the pathogen, it penetrates deeper into the Qi level. Here, the Wind aspect of the pathogen transforms into Heat, leading to the characteristic symptoms of fever, cough, and thirst. Pre-existing Lung Yin Deficiency can exacerbate the condition, making the Lung more vulnerable to Heat damage.

**Progression:**
`Untreated Upper Burner Lung Heat can progress to deeper levels, leading to Lung Yin Deficiency, Phlegm-Heat in the Lung, or even affect other organs like the Heart.`

**Common Transformations:**
- Pattern may transform into: [[Lung Yin Deficiency]]
- May combine with: [[Phlegm-Heat in the Lung]]
