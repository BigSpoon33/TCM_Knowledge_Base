# `=this.name`

**Type:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_type`
**Nature:** `= this.pattern_data.excess_deficiency` | `= this.pattern_data.hot_cold`
**Location:** `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`


## 🏷️ Pattern Classification

**System:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_type`
**Subtype:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_subtype`

**Eight Principles Analysis:**
- Excess/Deficiency: `= this.pattern_data.excess_deficiency`
- Hot/Cold: `= this.pattern_data.hot_cold`
- Interior/Exterior: `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`
- Yin/Yang: `= this.pattern_data.yin_yang`


## 🔍 Clinical Manifestations

### Cardinal Symptoms (CAM)
**Essential Symptoms:**
- High fever at night
- Delirium
- Deep-red and stiff tongue without coating
- Fine and rapid pulse

### Complete Symptom Picture

**Chief Symptoms:**
- High fever at night (worse at night as Yin is depleted)
- Delirium (indicating Shen disturbance)
- Aphasia (difficulty speaking due to heat obstructing the Heart orifices)

**Accompanying Symptoms:**
- Burning sensation of the epigastrium (heat in the Middle Burner)
- Cold limbs (paradoxical symptom due to heat trapping Yang Qi internally, preventing it from reaching the extremities)
- Possible skin rashes (due to heat in the Blood)
- Restlessness
- Insomnia

**Tongue:** `= this.pattern_data.tongue`

**Pulse:** `= this.pattern_data.pulse`


## 🔄 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | This Pattern | Similar Pattern 1 | Similar Pattern 2 |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Chief symptom | High fever, delirium | High fever, manic behavior | Epigastric pain, irritability |
| Tongue | Deep-red, stiff, no coat | Red, yellow coat, dry | Red, yellow coat |
| Pulse | Fine, rapid | Wiry, rapid | Slippery, rapid |
| Key distinction | Night fever, stiff tongue | Mania, wiry pulse | Epigastric pain, phlegm signs |

**vs. [[Heat in the Blood]]:**
- Key difference: Heat in the Blood presents with bleeding symptoms and potentially more pronounced skin manifestations, while Upper Burner Heat in PC focuses on Shen disturbance and deep Yin consumption.

**vs. [[Phlegm Fire Harassing the Heart]]:**
- Key difference: Phlegm Fire involves the presence of phlegm signs, such as a greasy tongue coating and potentially rattling sounds in the throat, which are absent in pure Upper Burner Heat in PC.


### Key Herbs

**Essential Herbs for This Pattern:**
- [[Xi Jiao]] –  (Rhino Horn, now often substituted with Shui Niu Jiao - Buffalo Horn) Cools the Blood, clears Heat, and eliminates toxins. Dosage considerations: Use with caution due to ethical considerations (use Shui Niu Jiao). High dosage may be required for severe cases.
- [[Sheng Di Huang]] –  Nourishes Yin, generates fluids, and cools the Blood. Dosage considerations: Use unprocessed to maximize cooling effect.
- [[Jin Yin Hua]] –  Clears Heat, resolves toxicity, and expels Wind-Heat. Dosage considerations: Use early in the course of the disease.

##  Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**
- Cold conditions
- Spleen Qi deficiency
- Pregnancy (use caution with strong blood-cooling herbs)

**Cautions:**
- Monitor the patient's condition closely, as the condition can deteriorate rapidly.
- Adjust the dosage of herbs based on the patient's age, constitution, and severity of the condition.

**When to Avoid:**
- Using warming herbs, as they can exacerbate the heat.


## 🏷️ Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Encephalitis
- Meningitis
- Septicemia
- Severe infection with high fever

**Biomedical Understanding:**
These conditions are characterized by inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, or bloodstream, often caused by bacterial or viral infections. The inflammation can lead to neurological damage and organ failure.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM pattern diagnosis provides a more nuanced understanding of the patient's individual presentation and allows for a more tailored treatment approach, addressing both the root cause and the branch symptoms.


## ✅ Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Always assess the patient's tongue and pulse carefully to confirm the diagnosis.
- Monitor the patient's mental state closely, as changes in consciousness can indicate the progression of the disease.
- Adjust the dosage of herbs based on the patient's age, constitution, and severity of the condition.

### Common Mistakes
- Using warming herbs, as they can exacerbate the heat.
- Neglecting to nourish Yin, which can lead to further depletion of fluids.
- Failing to monitor the patient's condition closely, which can result in delayed treatment.

### Treatment Modifications
- **If the patient is elderly or debilitated:** Use lower dosages of herbs to avoid overwhelming the system.
- **If the patient has a pre-existing Yin deficiency:** Increase the dosage of Yin-nourishing herbs.

### Success Indicators
- Reduction in fever
- Improvement in mental clarity
- Return of tongue coating
