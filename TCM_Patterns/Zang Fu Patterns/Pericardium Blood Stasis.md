  etiology:
  - Chronic Qi Stagnation from emotional stress
  - Underlying Heart Qi or Yang Deficiency
  - Invasion of Pathogenic Cold into the chest
  - Diet high in greasy foods leading to Phlegm which combines with stasis
  - Trauma
  pathomechanisms:
  - Qi is the commander of Blood; long-term Qi stagnation in the chest (often from
    Liver Qi Stagnation affecting the Pericardium) leads to Blood stasis.
  - Weakened Heart/Pericardium Qi or Yang fails to propel Blood, causing it to stagnate
    in the chest vessels.
  - Cold congeals and contracts, obstructing the flow of Blood in the Pericardium
    channel.
  - Blood stasis obstructs the Pericardium channel and vessels, leading to fixed,
    stabbing pain and impaired Heart function.
  disease_progression: This pattern often develops from Pericardium Qi Stagnation
    or as a complication of long-standing Heart Qi/Yang Deficiency. The stasis of
    Blood in the Pericardium directly obstructs the Heart's function and can disturb
    the Shen. If left untreated, it can lead to severe, life-threatening conditions
    corresponding to myocardial infarction.
  cardinal_symptoms:
  - Stabbing pain in the chest, fixed in location
  - Chest oppression or a feeling of constriction
  - Purplish tongue, lips, and nails
  - Choppy, hesitant, or knotted pulse
  tongue: Purplish or dark red tongue body, possibly with purple spots (petechiae),
    especially on the sides of the chest area. Sublingual veins are often dark, distended,
    and tortuous.
  pulse: Choppy (se), hesitant, knotted (jie), or intermittent (dai).
  treatment_principle:
  - Invigorate Blood
  - Break up Blood Stasis
  - Unblock the Pericardium Channel
  - Regulate Qi
  - Stop Pain
  contraindications:
  - Strongly contraindicated during pregnancy.
  - Use with extreme caution in patients with bleeding disorders or those on anticoagulant
    or antiplatelet medications.

# 🔮 Pericardium Blood Stasis

**Type:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_type`
**Nature:** `= this.pattern_data.excess_deficiency` | `= this.pattern_data.hot_cold`
**Location:** `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`

---

## 📖 Overview

Pericardium Blood Stasis is a serious Excess pattern characterized by the obstruction of Blood flow in the Pericardium channel, which directly impacts the function of the Heart. As the "wrapping" of the Heart, the Pericardium's pathology is often interchangeable with that of the Heart itself. This pattern manifests with the cardinal signs of Blood Stasis located in the chest: fixed, stabbing chest pain, a purplish tongue, and a choppy or knotted pulse.

This condition frequently arises from chronic emotional stress leading to Qi stagnation, which over time congeals Blood. It can also develop from underlying deficiencies, where Heart Qi or Yang is too weak to properly circulate Blood, leading to stagnation. The presence of Blood Stasis signifies a significant obstruction and corresponds to severe conditions like angina pectoris or coronary artery disease in Western medicine. Treatment must be prompt and potent, focusing on invigorating Blood, breaking stasis, and alleviating the characteristic severe pain.

## 🎯 Pattern Classification

**System:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_type`
**Subtype:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_subtype`

**Eight Principles Analysis:**
- Excess/Deficiency: `= this.pattern_data.excess_deficiency` (Stasis is an Excess pathogenic factor, though it can arise from an underlying Deficiency)
- Hot/Cold: `= this.pattern_data.hot_cold` (The pattern itself is neutral, but can be complicated by Cold or Heat)
- Interior/Exterior: `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`
- Yin/Yang: `= this.pattern_data.yin_yang` (Affects Blood, a Yin substance, within the chest)

---

## 🧬 Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
- `= this.pattern_data.etiology`

### Pathomechanisms
- `= this.pattern_data.pathomechanisms`

**Development:**
The most common pathway is long-term emotional constraint causing Liver Qi Stagnation, which invades the chest and obstructs the Qi mechanism of the Heart and Pericardium. This prolonged Qi stagnation eventually leads to Blood Stasis. Alternatively, pre-existing Heart Qi or Yang deficiency creates a state of poor circulation where Blood can easily stagnate in the chest.

**Progression:**
`= this.pattern_data.disease_progression`

**Common Transformations:**
- May combine with: [[Phlegm Obstruction of the Heart]], [[Heart Qi Deficiency]], [[Heart Yang Deficiency]]
- In severe cases, the sudden obstruction can lead to [[Heart Yang Collapse]].

## 🎯 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | Pericardium Blood Stasis | Pericardium Qi Stagnation | Heart Yang Deficiency | Phlegm Obstructing PC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pain** | Fixed, stabbing, severe | Distending, moving, less severe | Dull ache, oppressive | Stifling, heavy sensation |
| **Tongue** | Purple, dark spots | Slightly purple sides | Pale, wet, swollen | Swollen with thick, greasy coat |
| **Pulse** | Choppy, knotted | Wiry | Deep, weak, slow | Slippery, wiry |
| **Key Distinction** | Signs of stasis (purple tongue, stabbing pain) | Pain related to emotions, moves | Prominent cold signs, deficiency | Phlegm signs (greasy coat, slippery pulse) |

**vs. [[Heart Blood Stasis]]:**
- These two patterns are practically identical and often used interchangeably. Some practitioners may differentiate by emphasizing more pronounced mental-emotional symptoms (anxiety, restlessness) when diagnosing Pericardium Blood Stasis, as the Pericardium has a closer relationship with the mind (Shen).

**vs. [[Pericardium Qi Stagnation]]:**
- Qi stagnation causes distending, wandering pain that is closely tied to emotional state. Blood stasis causes fixed, stabbing pain. Qi stagnation is the precursor to Blood stasis, so a wiry pulse may be present in both, but the choppy or knotted quality is specific to Blood stasis.

## ⚠️ Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**
- `= this.pattern_data.contraindications`

**Cautions:**
- This pattern can indicate a serious underlying cardiovascular condition. Patients with severe chest pain should seek immediate Western medical evaluation.
- Monitor for signs of induced deficiency (fatigue, paleness) after prolonged treatment with strong Blood-breaking herbs and adjust by adding tonics.

**When to Avoid:**
- Pregnancy.
- Active bleeding or hemorrhagic disorders.

---

## 🔄 Pattern Variations & Combinations

### Common Variations
- **With Cold:** Pain is more severe, cramping, and is relieved by warmth. Add warming and dispersing herbs like [[Gui Zhi]] or [[Xi Xin]].
- **With Heat:** Patient may have a red face, thirst, and a rapid pulse. Add heat-clearing and blood-cooling herbs like [[Mu Dan Pi]] and [[Sheng Di Huang]].

### Common Combinations
- **With [[Pericardium Qi Stagnation]]:** This is the most common combination, as stasis rarely exists without stagnant Qi. Treatment should strongly move both Qi and Blood. [[Xue Fu Zhu Yu Tang]] is ideal as it addresses both.
- **With [[Heart Yang Deficiency]]:** Signs of cold (cold limbs, aversion to cold, pale wet tongue) are prominent. Add Yang-tonifying herbs like [[Fu Zi]] and [[Gan Jiang]] to treatment.

## 🏥 Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- [[Angina Pectoris]]
- [[Coronary Artery Disease]] (CAD)
- [[Myocardial Infarction]] (Heart Attack)
- [[Pericarditis]]
- [[Costochondritis]]

**Biomedical Understanding:**
This pattern's signs and symptoms strongly correlate with cardiac ischemia, where blood flow to the heart muscle is obstructed, typically by atherosclerosis. The stabbing pain reflects myocardial tissue distress from lack of oxygen. Cyanosis indicates systemic hypoxia. The purplish tongue is a manifestation of microcirculation stasis and deoxygenated blood. Blood-invigorating herbs have been shown in studies to have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and vasodilating effects, improving microcirculation.

---

## 💡 Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- The combination of a purple tongue and fixed, stabbing chest pain is the definitive diagnostic key.
- Always assess for an underlying deficiency (Qi, Yang) or a coexisting pathogenic factor (Qi Stagnation, Phlegm). Pure Blood Stasis is rare.
- [[PC-4]] is an exceptional point for acute episodes of chest pain. Patients can be taught to apply acupressure here for self-care.
- The sublingual veins are a crucial part of the tongue diagnosis for this pattern; they are often the first and most dramatic sign of stasis.

### Common Mistakes
- Focusing solely on breaking stasis without addressing the underlying cause (e.g., Qi Stagnation or Yang Deficiency), leading to recurrence.
- Using insufficient dosages of Blood-invigorating herbs. This is a stubborn condition that requires a strong therapeutic approach.
- Overlooking the emotional component. Calming the Shen and regulating Qi is often crucial for long-term success.
