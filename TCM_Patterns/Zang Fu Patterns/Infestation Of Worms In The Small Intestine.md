**Type:** `Zang Fu`
**Nature:** `Mixed Excess-Deficiency` | `Neither`
**Location:** `Interior`


## 🏷️ Pattern Classification

**System:** `Zang Fu`
**Subtype:** `Small Intestine`

**Eight Principles Analysis:**
- Excess/Deficiency: `Mixed Excess-Deficiency`
- Hot/Cold: `Neither`
- Interior/Exterior: `Interior`
- Yin/Yang: `Yin`


## 🔍 Clinical Manifestations

### Cardinal Symptoms (CAM)
**Essential Symptoms:**
- Abdominal pain that may be colicky or intermittent
- Anal itching, especially at night
- Presence of worms in stool or vomit
- Changes in appetite (increased or decreased)
- Sallow or pale complexion

### Complete Symptom Picture

**Chief Symptoms:**
- Abdominal pain and distension
- Anal itching, especially at night
- Vomiting of worms (in severe cases)

**Accompanying Symptoms:**
- Sallow complexion
- Fatigue and weakness
- Diarrhea or constipation
- Poor appetite or increased hunger
- Desire to eat unusual substances (e.g., soil, uncooked rice)
- Weight loss
- Irritability

**Tongue:** May be normal or slightly pale with a thin white coating. In cases of long-term infestation, the tongue may be pale and swollen with teeth marks, indicating Spleen Qi Deficiency. A sticky coating may indicate dampness.

**Pulse:** May be wiry (弦) due to pain or slippery (滑) if dampness is present. In cases of Spleen Qi Deficiency, the pulse may be weak (弱).


## 🔄 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | This Pattern | Similar Pattern 1 | Similar Pattern 2 |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Chief symptom | Abdominal pain, anal itching, worms | Abdominal pain, distension, diarrhea | Abdominal pain, poor appetite, fatigue |
| Tongue | Pale, possibly swollen with teeth marks | Sticky, yellow coating | Pale, swollen with teeth marks |
| Pulse | Wiry or slippery, possibly weak | Slippery, rapid | Weak |
| Key distinction | Presence of worms | Damp-heat signs | Spleen Qi Deficiency signs |

**vs. [[Damp-Heat in the Large Intestine]]:**
- Key difference: Damp-Heat presents with fever, burning sensation in the anus, and yellow, foul-smelling stools, whereas worm infestation has worms present and anal itching.

**vs. [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]]:**
- Key difference: While worm infestation can lead to Spleen Qi Deficiency, the primary cause is the presence of worms. Spleen Qi Deficiency has no worms, and is caused by dietary issues, overthinking, or chronic disease.


### Key Herbs

**Essential Herbs for This Pattern:**
- [[Shi Jun Zi]] – Kills worms, strengthens the Spleen. Dosage: 6-12g
- [[Bing Lang]] – Kills worms, promotes digestion, and facilitates the downward movement of Qi. Dosage: 6-15g
- [[Lei Wan]] – Powerful anti-parasitic herb that kills various types of worms. Dosage: 9-15g
- [[Ku Lian Pi]] – Kills worms, clears heat, and dries dampness. Dosage: 3-9g

##  Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**
- Pregnancy (some anti-parasitic herbs are contraindicated)
- Severe deficiency of Qi and Blood
- Debilitated patients should be carefully monitored
- Fever due to external contraction should be treated first

**Cautions:**
- Use anti-parasitic herbs with caution in patients with weak digestion.
- Monitor patients closely for any adverse reactions to anti-parasitic herbs.

**When to Avoid:**
- Avoid using strong anti-parasitic herbs in patients with severe Spleen Qi Deficiency until the deficiency has been addressed.


## 🏷️ Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Ascariasis
- Hookworm infection
- Enterobiasis (Pinworm infection)
- Taeniasis (Tapeworm infection)

**Biomedical Understanding:**
Western medicine identifies these conditions through microscopic examination of stool samples to detect the presence of worm eggs or larvae. Treatment typically involves the use of anthelmintic medications to kill the worms.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM can be used as a complementary therapy to address the underlying imbalances that may contribute to worm infestations and to alleviate symptoms such as abdominal pain and fatigue. TCM can also help to strengthen the digestive system and prevent recurrence of the infection.


## ✅ Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Always rule out worm infestation in patients with unexplained abdominal pain or digestive disturbances.
- Use a stool test to confirm the diagnosis before initiating treatment.
- Consider the patient's overall constitution and address any underlying deficiencies or imbalances.

### Common Mistakes
- Failing to address underlying Spleen Qi Deficiency, leading to recurrence of the infestation.
- Using anti-parasitic herbs without considering the patient's tolerance and sensitivity.

### Treatment Modifications
- **If the patient is weak:** Reduce the dosage of anti-parasitic herbs and focus on tonifying the Spleen.
- **If the patient has constipation:** Add herbs that moisten the intestines and promote bowel movements.

### Success Indicators
- Reduction in abdominal pain and anal itching
- Absence of worms in stool samples
- Improved appetite and digestion
