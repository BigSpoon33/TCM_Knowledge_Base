# `=this.name`

**Type:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_type`
**Nature:** `= this.pattern_data.excess_deficiency` | `= this.pattern_data.hot_cold`
**Location:** `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`


## 🏷️ Pattern Classification

**System:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_type`
**Subtype:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_subtype`

**Eight Principles Analysis:**
- Excess/Deficiency: `= this.pattern_data.excess_deficiency`
- Hot/Cold: `= this.pattern_data.hot_cold`
- Interior/Exterior: `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`
- Yin/Yang: `= this.pattern_data.yin_yang`


## 🔍 Clinical Manifestations

### Cardinal Symptoms (CAM)
**Essential Symptoms:**
- Diarrhea (chronic, possibly with undigested food)
- Feeling of bearing down in the anus
- Rectal prolapse (in severe cases)

### Complete Symptom Picture

**Chief Symptoms:**
- Chronic diarrhea or loose stools
- Feeling of bearing down in the anus, as if something is falling out
- Rectal prolapse (in severe or long-standing cases)

**Accompanying Symptoms:**
- Fatigue and weakness
- Abdominal distension, especially after eating
- Poor appetite
- Frequent urination
- Incontinence of stool (in severe cases)
- Dizziness
- Pale complexion

**Tongue:** `= this.pattern_data.tongue`

**Pulse:** `= this.pattern_data.pulse`


## 🔄 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | This Pattern | Similar Pattern 1 | Similar Pattern 2 |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Chief symptom | Diarrhea, bearing down | Fatigue, loose stools | Fatigue, dizziness |
| Tongue | Pale, teeth marks | Pale, swollen | Pale, thin |
| Pulse | Weak, thready | Weak, deficient | Fine, weak |
| Key distinction | Bearing down sensation | No bearing down | No bearing down |

**vs. [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]]:**
- Key difference: Spleen Qi Deficiency presents with more general digestive weakness and fatigue, *without* the specific bearing-down sensation indicating prolapse. While Large Intestine Collapse originates from a Spleen Qi Deficiency, it represents a more advanced stage where the Qi sinking has become a primary feature.

**vs. [[Kidney Yang Deficiency]]:**
- Key difference: Kidney Yang Deficiency often presents with cold signs (cold limbs, aversion to cold) and urinary problems (frequent urination, nocturia) in addition to diarrhea. Large Intestine Collapse lacks the pronounced cold signs and focuses more on the digestive and prolapse aspects.


### Key Herbs

**Essential Herbs for This Pattern:**
- [[Huang Qi]] – Tonifies Qi and raises the Yang, directly addressing the underlying Qi deficiency and sinking. Dosage typically ranges from 9-30g, depending on the severity of the deficiency.
- [[Ren Shen]] – Powerfully tonifies the Yuan Qi and strengthens the Spleen, providing essential energy for the body to heal. Dosage: 3-9g, depending on the quality of the herb and the patient's condition.
- [[Bai Zhu]] – Strengthens the Spleen, dries dampness, and supports the transformation and transportation functions of the Spleen. Dosage: 6-15g.
- [[Dang Gui]] - Nourishes Blood and harmonizes the Blood, important when Qi deficiency has led to Blood deficiency. Dosage: 6-12g.
- [[Sheng Ma]] – Raises the Yang Qi and lifts the sinking organs, specifically targeting the prolapse. Dosage: 3-9g.
- [[Chai Hu]] – Guides the Qi upward and regulates the Liver Qi, facilitating the lifting action. Dosage: 3-9g.

##  Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**
- Avoid strong purgatives.
- Avoid treatments that further drain Qi.

**Cautions:**
- In cases with significant Blood deficiency, address this concurrently with Qi tonification.
- In elderly or debilitated patients, use caution when tonifying Qi, starting with smaller doses and gradually increasing as tolerated.
- Ensure proper dietary advice is provided to support treatment.

**When to Avoid:**
- Avoid using Qi-tonifying herbs during acute infections or inflammatory conditions.


## 🏷️ Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Rectal Prolapse
- Chronic Diarrhea
- Fecal Incontinence
- Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
- Postpartum Prolapse

**Biomedical Understanding:**
Western medicine attributes rectal prolapse to weakened pelvic floor muscles, chronic straining during bowel movements, and conditions that increase intra-abdominal pressure. Chronic diarrhea is often linked to infections, inflammatory bowel disease, or dietary factors.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM pattern diagnosis can help differentiate the underlying causes of these conditions and tailor treatment accordingly. For example, TCM can distinguish between diarrhea caused by Spleen Qi Deficiency and diarrhea caused by Damp-Heat. TCM can also address the underlying Qi deficiency contributing to weakened pelvic floor muscles.


## ✅ Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Always assess the patient's overall Qi and Blood status to determine the appropriate treatment strategy.
- Consider the emotional component of the pattern, as stress and anxiety can exacerbate Spleen Qi Deficiency.
- Dietary advice is crucial for successful treatment.

### Common Mistakes
- Focusing solely on the prolapse without addressing the underlying Qi deficiency.
- Using overly draining or purgative herbs, which can further weaken the Qi.
- Neglecting lifestyle factors, such as overwork and poor diet.

### Treatment Modifications
- **If diarrhea is severe:** Add herbs to astringe the intestine and stop diarrhea, such as Rou Dou Kou or Chi Shi Zhi.
- **If there is significant Blood deficiency:** Add herbs to nourish Blood, such as Dang Gui and Bai Shao.

### Success Indicators
- Reduction in diarrhea frequency and improved stool consistency.
- Decreased feeling of bearing down in the anus.
- Gradual improvement in overall energy levels and appetite.
