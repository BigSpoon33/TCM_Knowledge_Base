## 📖 Overview

Intestinal Parasites (Ji Chong) is a distinct pattern in TCM, primarily affecting the Small Intestine, but also involving the Spleen and Stomach. It is considered a Mixed Excess-Deficiency pattern: the parasites themselves represent an Excess pathogenic factor, while their presence almost invariably arises from and contributes to an underlying Deficiency of the host's righteous Qi (Zheng Qi), particularly Spleen Qi.

The parasites consume the body's vital substances (Qi, Blood, and nutrients), leading to malnutrition, a sallow complexion, and fatigue. Simultaneously, their physical presence obstructs the flow of Qi in the intestines, causing intermittent, often colicky, abdominal pain. Diagnosis is confirmed by specific signs related to the type of worm, such as anal itching (pinworms), strange cravings (hookworms), or visual confirmation of worms.

## 🎯 Pattern Classification

**System:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_type`
**Subtype:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_subtype`

**Eight Principles Analysis:**
- Excess/Deficiency: `= this.pattern_data.excess_deficiency`

- Interior/Exterior: `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`
- Yin/Yang: `= this.pattern_data.yin_yang`

## 🧬 Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
- Ingestion of contaminated food or water containing parasitic eggs or larvae
- Poor personal and food hygiene
- Underlying Spleen Qi Deficiency, which weakens digestive function and creates an environment favorable for parasites to thrive

### Pathomechanisms
- Parasites lodge in the intestines, consuming Qi, Blood, and nutrients directly from the host, leading to a state of Deficiency.
- The physical presence and movement of worms obstruct the Qi mechanism of the Middle Jiao, causing stagnation which manifests as abdominal pain, distension, and bloating.
- Parasitic activity can generate toxic byproducts, which may manifest as Dampness or Heat signs.

**Development:**
The condition begins with exposure to parasites. However, a robust digestive system (strong Spleen and Stomach Qi) can often resist infestation. The pattern typically develops when a person with pre-existing Spleen Qi Deficiency is exposed, allowing the parasites to establish themselves and multiply.

**Progression:**
`= this.pattern_data.disease_progression`

**Common Transformations:**
- May lead to severe [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]] or [[Blood Deficiency]]
- In children, may develop into Gan Ji (Nutritional Impairment) syndrome
- In acute cases, a large mass of worms can cause intestinal obstruction, a medical emergency

## 🎯 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | WORMS (Small Intestine) | Spleen Qi Deficiency | Food Stagnation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chief symptom | Intermittent, colicky pain | Dull ache, bloating after eating | Fullness, distending pain |
| Appetite | Variable, pica, ravenous | Poor appetite | Aversion to food |
| Complexion | Sallow, pale yellow | Sallow, pale | Normal or dull |
| Key distinction | Specific signs (pica, anal itch) | Fatigue, loose stools | Relieved by bowel movement/vomit |

**vs. [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]]:**
- Key difference: Spleen Qi Deficiency features chronic fatigue, bloating, and loose stools as the primary complaints. Pain is typically dull and improves with pressure. The WORMS pattern is defined by the specific, often sharp, intermittent pain and unique signs like pica or anal itching, which are absent in simple Spleen Deficiency.

**vs. [[Food Stagnation]]:**
- Key difference: Pain from Food Stagnation is directly related to overeating, feels like fullness and distension, and is relieved by vomiting or a bowel movement. The pulse is Slippery and Forceful. Worm pain is often unrelated to meals, more colicky in nature, and the pulse is typically Wiry.

## 💊 Treatment Approach

### Treatment Principles
- Expel parasites from the intestines
- Regulate the Qi of the Middle Jiao to stop pain
- Strengthen the Spleen to address the root Deficiency and prevent recurrence

### Representative Formulas

**Primary Formula:**
- [[Wu Mei Wan]] (Mume Pill) → A classic formula for roundworm (ascaris) infestation, especially with a mixed cold/heat presentation. It simultaneously expels parasites, warms the interior, and calms the worms.

**Alternative Formulas:**
- [[Fei Er Wan]] (Fat Baby Pill) → Used for childhood nutritional impairment (Gan Syndrome) due to parasites, addressing both the parasites and the resulting deficiency.
- [[Hua Chong Wan]] (Transform Parasites Pill) → A broader-spectrum anti-parasitic formula.

### Key Herbs

**Essential Herbs for This Pattern:**
- [[Bing Lang]] (Semen Arecae) → Expels various parasites (especially tapeworms), promotes urination, moves Qi.
- [[Shi Jun Zi]] (Fructus Quisqualis) → Expels roundworms and pinworms, strengthens the Spleen.
- [[Ku Lian Pi]] (Cortex Meliae) → A broad-spectrum antiparasitic herb, also clears Damp-Heat.
- [[Da Suan]] (Bulbus Allii Sativi / Garlic) → Kills hookworms and pinworms.

### Acupuncture Points

**Additional Notes:**
Treatment: Acupuncture is not applicable

**Practitioner's Note:**
While herbal therapy is the primary modality for expelling parasites, acupuncture can be a valuable adjunctive treatment. It helps to regulate intestinal Qi, alleviate pain, and strengthen the Spleen to address the underlying deficiency. The original source's note likely emphasizes that needles alone cannot kill worms.

**Primary Points:**
- [[ST-25 (Tian Shu)]] → Front-Mu point of the Large Intestine, regulates the intestines, alleviates abdominal pain.
- [[ST-36 (Zu San Li)]] → Tonifies Spleen and Stomach Qi, strengthens the body's resistance.
- **Bai Chong Wo (M-LE-13)** → "Hundred Insects Nest," an extra point specifically indicated for intestinal parasites. Located 1 cun superior to SP-10.

**Supporting Points:**
- [[SP-4 (Gong Sun)]] → Confluent point of the Chong Mai, harmonizes the Middle Jiao, relieves abdominal pain.
- [[LI-4 (He Gu)]] → Command point for the face and mouth, can address issues like bad breath and regulate Qi.
- [[RN-6 (Qi Hai)]] → Tonifies Qi and strengthens the constitution.

## ⚠️ Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**
- Many antiparasitic herbs (e.g., Bing Lang, Ku Lian Pi) have some level of toxicity and are contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation.
- Use with extreme caution in patients who are very frail or have severe Qi and Blood Deficiency without concurrent tonifying herbs.

**Cautions:**
- Treatment should be followed by a course of Spleen-tonifying herbs to restore digestive health and prevent re-infestation.
- Hygiene is paramount: advise patients on hand washing, proper food preparation, and treating other household members if necessary.

---

## 🔄 Pattern Variations & Combinations

### Common Variations
- **With Severe Qi Stagnation:** Excruciating abdominal pain. Add Qi-regulating herbs like [[Chuan Lian Zi]] and [[Yan Hu Suo]].
- **With Damp-Heat:** Burning sensation in the anus, foul-smelling stools, yellow greasy tongue coat. Add Heat-clearing, Damp-draining herbs like [[Huang Lian]] and [[Huang Bai]].

### Common Combinations
- **With [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]]:** The most common combination. The antiparasitic formula should always be combined with or followed by Spleen tonics like [[Si Jun Zi Tang]].

## 🏥 Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Helminthiasis (general term for worm infestation)
- Ascariasis (Roundworm)
- Enterobiasis (Pinworm)
- Cestodiasis (Tapeworm)
- Ancylostomiasis (Hookworm)

**Biomedical Understanding:**
This pattern directly corresponds to parasitic infections of the gastrointestinal tract. The TCM symptoms align well with biomedical understanding: parasites cause malabsorption and nutrient depletion (sallow complexion, deficiency), mechanical irritation and obstruction (abdominal pain), and specific allergic or toxic reactions (anal itching, pica).

---

## 💡 Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Always inquire about teeth grinding, anal itching, and strange cravings, especially in children with digestive complaints.
- White spots on the face ("worm spots" or "tinea faciei") or nails can be a supporting sign.
- Treatment is often done in cycles (e.g., one week on, one week off) to target different stages of the parasite lifecycle.
- Consider treating the entire family to prevent re-infection, especially with pinworms.

### Common Mistakes
- Focusing only on expelling parasites without tonifying the underlying Spleen Deficiency. This can lead to recurrence.
- Using overly strong or toxic herbs for too long, which can damage the patient's Zheng Qi.
