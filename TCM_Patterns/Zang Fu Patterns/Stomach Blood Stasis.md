## 📋 Overview

Stomach Blood Stasis is a TCM pattern characterized by the obstruction of Stomach function due to stagnant blood. This stagnation can arise from various causes, including trauma, emotional stress, improper diet, or pre-existing Qi stagnation. The primary manifestation of Stomach Blood Stasis is fixed, stabbing epigastric pain.

This pattern signifies a deeper level of imbalance compared to simple Stomach Qi Stagnation. Blood, having a denser and more substantial nature than Qi, tends to obstruct the flow of nutrients and energy, leading to more pronounced and persistent symptoms. The consequences of untreated Stomach Blood Stasis can be serious, including chronic pain, impaired digestion, and even bleeding. A timely and accurate diagnosis is thus crucial for effective treatment.

- Hot/Cold: `Neither`
- Interior/Exterior: `Interior`
- Yin/Yang: `Yin`

## 🌱 Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
- Trauma to the epigastric region (blunt force, surgery)
- Emotional stress, particularly anger, frustration, and resentment, leading to Liver Qi Stagnation, which can then affect Stomach Qi.
- Dietary irregularities, especially excessive consumption of cold, raw, greasy, or spicy foods, damaging Stomach Qi and Blood.
- Pre-existing conditions such as Stomach Qi Stagnation or Liver Qi Stagnation, which can progress to Blood Stasis over time.
- Chronic Stomach disorders, such as gastritis or ulcers, can damage the Stomach vessels and promote Blood Stasis.
- Internal generation of dampness and phlegm, which obstruct the flow of Qi and Blood in the Stomach.

### Pathomechanisms
- **Initial Qi Stagnation:** The process often begins with Qi stagnation, which can be caused by emotional stress, dietary indiscretions, or other factors. Qi moves Blood, so when Qi stagnates, Blood flow becomes sluggish, leading to stasis.
- **Blood Stagnation:** As Qi stagnates, Blood movement slows down and becomes congealed. This Blood stasis obstructs the normal function of the Stomach, preventing it from receiving and transforming food properly. The congested Blood accumulates and damages the Stomach tissues.
- **Obstruction and Pain:** The accumulation of stagnant Blood obstructs the Stomach's network vessels and prevents the proper flow of Qi and Blood. This obstruction results in fixed, stabbing pain in the epigastric region. Because Blood stasis is a tangible entity, the pain is characteristically severe and localized.
- **Impaired Stomach Function:** Blood stasis impairs the Stomach's ability to receive, rot, and ripen food. This leads to poor appetite, nausea, and indigestion. Over time, the impaired Stomach function can also lead to weight loss and general weakness.
- **Bleeding:** In severe cases, the prolonged stasis can erode the Stomach lining, leading to ulceration and bleeding. This can manifest as hematemesis (vomiting blood) or melena (dark, tarry stools). The blood is often dark and clotted due to the stagnant nature of the Blood.

**Development:**
The pattern commonly develops gradually from Stomach Qi Stagnation. The initial stagnation impairs Blood circulation, leading to accumulation.

**Progression:**
Stomach Blood Stasis can progress to chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and in severe cases, may mimic or contribute to the development of tumors or cancer.

**Common Transformations:**
- Pattern may transform into: [[Phlegm and Blood Stasis]]
- May combine with: [[Stomach Qi Deficiency]]

## 🔄 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | This Pattern | Similar Pattern 1 | Similar Pattern 2 |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Chief symptom | Fixed stabbing pain, hematemesis, melena | Distending epigastric pain | Burning epigastric pain |
| Tongue | Purple, spots | Normal or slightly red | Red with little coat |
| Pulse | Choppy or Wiry | Wiry | Thin, rapid |
| Key distinction | Fixed pain, bleeding | Pain moves, no bleeding | Burning sensation, thirst |

**vs. [[Stomach Qi Stagnation]]:**
- Key difference: Stomach Qi Stagnation presents with distending pain and belching, while Stomach Blood Stasis features fixed, stabbing pain and bleeding.

**vs. [[Stomach Yin Deficiency]]:**
- Key difference: Stomach Yin Deficiency presents with a burning sensation, thirst, and dry mouth, while Stomach Blood Stasis features fixed pain, bleeding, and a purple tongue.

## ✅ Treatment Approach

### Treatment Principles
- Activate Blood and Dispel Stasis in the Stomach
- Regulate Qi and Alleviate Pain
- Promote Healing of Damaged Stomach Tissue
- Address the Underlying Cause (e.g., emotional stress, dietary factors)

### Representative Formulas

**Primary Formula:**
- [[Shi Xiao San]] – This formula is a classical combination of Pu Huang and Wu Ling Zhi that strongly activates blood and dispels stasis, specifically for pain due to blood stasis.

**Alternative Formulas:**
- [[Dan Zhen Yin]] – Used when Liver Qi Stagnation is also present. Helps to soothe the Liver and move Qi to facilitate Blood circulation in the Stomach.
- [[Ge Xia Zhu Yu Tang]] – Used for more chronic cases of Blood Stasis in the epigastric region, often when there's a palpable mass. It is a stronger formula for breaking up Blood Stasis.
- [[Tong You Tang]] - For Blood Stasis causing upper abdominal pain specifically

## = Pattern Variations & Combinations

### Common Variations
- **Qi and Blood Stasis:** More pronounced Qi stagnation alongside Blood Stasis. Add Qi-regulating herbs.
- **Blood Stasis with Heat:** Manifests with fever, thirst, and a yellow tongue coat. Add Heat-clearing herbs.

### Common Combinations
- **With [[Stomach Qi Stagnation]]:** Presents with both distending and stabbing pain. Use formulas like Dan Zhen Yin to address both Qi and Blood.

## 🏷️ Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Gastric ulcer
- Gastric cancer
- Gastritis (chronic)
- Esophageal varices
- Post-operative complications (abdominal surgery)
- Trauma to the abdomen

**Biomedical Understanding:**
These conditions involve damage to the gastric mucosa, leading to inflammation, ulceration, and bleeding. Blood stasis in TCM may be related to impaired microcirculation, inflammation, and tissue damage in the stomach.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM pattern diagnosis provides a deeper understanding of the underlying imbalances contributing to these conditions. It can help tailor treatment strategies to address not only the symptoms but also the root causes of the illness.

## ✅ Classical Sources & Commentary

### Historical References
**First Appearance:**
- Source text: Yi Zong Jin Jian (Golden Mirror of Medicine)
- Reference: Chapter on Stomach Pain

**Key Classical Quotes:**
> "Blood stasis in the Stomach causes fixed, stabbing pain that is difficult to relieve."

### Traditional Understanding
In TCM, Stomach Blood Stasis is understood as an obstruction that impairs the Stomach's function of receiving and transforming food. The obstruction causes pain and disrupts the normal flow of Qi and Blood.

### Modern Interpretation
Modern TCM practitioners recognize Stomach Blood Stasis as a common pattern in patients with chronic gastric disorders. They emphasize the importance of differentiating it from other Stomach patterns and tailoring treatment accordingly.

---

## ✅ Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Always inquire about a history of trauma, surgery, or chronic Stomach problems.
- Palpate the epigastrium to assess for tenderness or a palpable mass.
- Check the tongue carefully for purplish spots or a dark purple color, particularly in the Stomach area.

### Common Mistakes
- Failing to differentiate Stomach Blood Stasis from Stomach Qi Stagnation.
- Using excessively strong blood-moving herbs in weak or deficient patients.
- Ignoring the underlying emotional factors contributing to Qi stagnation.

### Treatment Modifications
- **If the patient is weak or deficient:** Use gentler blood-moving herbs and focus on tonifying Qi and Blood.
- **If there is significant Heat:** Add Heat-clearing herbs to the formula.

### Success Indicators
- Reduction in epigastric pain.
- Improvement in appetite and digestion.
- Resolution of hematemesis or melena.
- Lightening of the tongue color.
