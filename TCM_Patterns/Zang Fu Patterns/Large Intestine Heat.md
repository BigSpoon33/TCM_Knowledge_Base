##  Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**

**Cautions:**
- Avoid strong purgatives in patients with underlying deficiency.
- Monitor fluid and electrolyte balance, especially with strong purgatives.

## 🏷️ Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Constipation
- Hemorrhoids
- Anal Fissures
- Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) - Constipation predominant

**Biomedical Understanding:**
Constipation is characterized by infrequent bowel movements or difficulty passing stools. Several factors can contribute to constipation, including low fiber diet, dehydration, lack of physical activity, medications, and underlying medical conditions.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM pattern diagnosis can help differentiate between different types of constipation and tailor treatment accordingly. For example, Large Intestine Heat corresponds to constipation with dry, hard stools, inflammation, and signs of systemic Heat. This allows for a more targeted approach than simply addressing the symptom of constipation.


## ✅ Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Ask about stool consistency and frequency.
- Observe facial complexion for redness.
- Check for thirst and desire for cold drinks.

### Common Mistakes
- Using strong purgatives in deficient patients.
- Ignoring underlying Qi or Yin deficiency.

### Treatment Modifications
- **If Yin deficiency is present:** Add Yin-nourishing herbs.
- **If Qi deficiency is present:** Add Qi-tonifying herbs, use caution with purgatives.

### Success Indicators
- Improvement in stool consistency.
- Reduction in thirst.
- Improvement in facial complexion.
