## 📋 Overview

Liver Qi Invading Stomach, also known as *Gan Wei Bu He*, represents a common disharmony pattern in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) characterized by the Liver's energetic influence disrupting the Stomach's proper functioning. The Liver, associated with the Wood element, has a natural tendency to ensure the smooth flow of Qi throughout the body. When Liver Qi stagnates due to emotional stress, frustration, or repression, it can overact on the Stomach, which belongs to the Earth element and is responsible for receiving and rotting/ripening food.

This pattern manifests as a combination of Liver Qi stagnation symptoms and Stomach Qi dysfunction symptoms. Clinically, patients often present with epigastric distention and pain, hypochondriac pain, belching, nausea, vomiting, sour regurgitation, irritability, and poor appetite. The treatment strategy aims to soothe Liver Qi, harmonize the Stomach, and restore the natural flow of Qi between these two vital organs.

## 🏷️ Pattern Classification

**System:** `Zang Fu`
**Subtype:** `Liver and Stomach`

**Eight Principles Analysis:**
- Excess/Deficiency: `Mixed Excess-Deficiency`
- Hot/Cold: `Neither`
- Interior/Exterior: `Interior`
- Yin/Yang: `Yin`

---

## 🌱 Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
- Emotional stress (anger, frustration, resentment)
- Prolonged emotional repression
- Irregular eating habits
- Consumption of greasy, spicy, or overly processed foods
- Chronic stress and overthinking
- Weakened Spleen function due to dietary imbalances

### Pathomechanisms
- **Liver Qi Stagnation:** Emotional stress, especially anger and frustration, directly impairs the smooth flow of Liver Qi. The Liver, responsible for ensuring the free flow of Qi throughout the body, becomes congested, causing distention and discomfort in the hypochondriac region. This stagnation is considered the "excess" aspect of the pattern.

- **Disruption of Stomach Qi:** The stagnated Liver Qi, according to the Five Element Theory, "overacts" on the Stomach. The Stomach's primary function is to receive and digest food and fluids and to descend Qi downwards. When the Liver Qi invades, it impairs the Stomach's ability to properly digest food and to descend Qi, leading to epigastric distention, belching, nausea, vomiting, and poor appetite.

- **Mixed Excess and Deficiency:** While Liver Qi stagnation represents the "excess," the impaired Stomach function often indicates a "deficiency." The chronic assault of Liver Qi can weaken the Stomach's ability to function effectively. Furthermore, if the condition persists, it can affect the Spleen, further weakening the digestive system. The body's ability to transform and transport fluids might also be impaired, creating dampness that further burdens the Stomach.

**Development:**
The pattern typically begins with emotional upset, leading to Liver Qi stagnation. This then affects the Stomach's function, resulting in digestive symptoms. Prolonged stagnation can lead to further complications, such as Blood stasis and Phlegm accumulation.

**Progression:**
Prolonged Liver Qi stagnation can lead to Blood stasis, Phlegm accumulation, and ultimately Heat or Fire in the Liver and Stomach. Chronic disharmony can weaken Spleen Qi leading to malabsorption and fatigue. In severe cases, Liver Yin deficiency can develop.

**Common Transformations:**
- Pattern may transform into: [[Liver Fire Blazing Upwards]]
- May combine with: [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]]

## 🔄 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | This Pattern | Liver Qi Stagnation | Food Stagnation |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Chief symptom | Epigastric pain, belching | Hypochondriac distention | Abdominal distention, foul-smelling belching |
| Tongue | Normal or slightly red, thin coating | Normal or slightly red, thin coating | Thick, greasy coating |
| Pulse | Wiry | Wiry | Slippery |
| Key distinction | Epigastric symptoms prominent | Hypochondriac symptoms prominent | Symptoms directly related to food intake |

**vs. [[Liver Qi Stagnation]]:**
- Key difference: In Liver Qi Stagnation, the digestive symptoms are less prominent, and the focus is more on emotional and hypochondriac discomfort. Liver Qi invading Stomach has significant digestive symptoms.

**vs. [[Food Stagnation]]:**
- Key difference: Food Stagnation is directly related to overeating or eating improper foods. The belching is foul-smelling, and the tongue coating is thick. Liver Qi Invading Stomach is more related to emotional stress, and the tongue coating is generally thinner.

## 🏷️ Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Gastritis
- Peptic ulcer disease
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
- Functional dyspepsia
- Anxiety disorders

**Biomedical Understanding:**
Western medicine views these conditions as primarily related to inflammation, acid production, motility disorders, or psychological factors. GERD involves the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus. Gastritis and ulcers involve inflammation or erosion of the stomach lining. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. Functional dyspepsia refers to persistent digestive symptoms without identifiable structural abnormalities. Psychological factors such as stress and anxiety can exacerbate these conditions.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM pattern diagnosis provides a more nuanced understanding of these conditions by considering the energetic imbalances and emotional factors that contribute to their development. TCM treatment can address both the symptoms and the underlying root cause, often leading to more lasting relief. For instance, acupuncture and herbal medicine can effectively modulate the autonomic nervous system, reduce inflammation, improve digestive motility, and address emotional stress.

## ✅ Classical Sources & Commentary

### Historical References
**First Appearance:**
- Source text: *Su Wen (Simple Questions)*
- Reference: Chapters on Liver and Stomach physiology and pathology

**Key Classical Quotes:**
> "The Liver governs the free flow of Qi. If the Liver's function is impaired, Qi stagnation will occur."
> "The Stomach governs the reception and rotting/ripening of food. If the Stomach is weak, food cannot be digested properly."

### Traditional Understanding
Classical TCM texts describe the Liver as responsible for the smooth flow of Qi throughout the body. Emotional stress and frustration are seen as primary causes of Liver Qi stagnation. The Stomach's function is to receive and digest food. When the Liver overacts on the Stomach, it impairs the Stomach's ability to perform its function, leading to digestive symptoms.

### Modern Interpretation
Contemporary TCM practitioners recognize Liver Qi Invading Stomach as a common pattern in modern society due to high levels of stress and poor dietary habits. The pattern is often seen in patients with chronic digestive issues and emotional disturbances. Treatment focuses on soothing Liver Qi, harmonizing the Stomach, and addressing the underlying emotional factors.

---

## ✅ Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Always inquire about the patient's emotional state and stressors.
- Pay attention to the tongue sides, which can indicate Liver Qi stagnation.
- Consider dietary modifications as a crucial part of the treatment plan.

### Common Mistakes
- Focusing solely on the digestive symptoms without addressing the Liver Qi stagnation.
- Using overly strong Qi-moving herbs in patients with weak constitutions.
- Neglecting to address the underlying emotional factors.

### Treatment Modifications
- **If Stomach Yin deficiency is present:** Add Yin-nourishing herbs such as *Mai Men Dong* and *Sha Shen*.
- **If Phlegm is present:** Add Phlegm-resolving herbs such as *Chen Pi* and *Ban Xia*.
- **If Blood stasis is present:** Add Blood-moving herbs such as *Dan Shen* and *Chuan Xiong*.

### Success Indicators
- Relief of epigastric distention and pain.
- Improved appetite and digestion.
- Reduced irritability and improved emotional state.
