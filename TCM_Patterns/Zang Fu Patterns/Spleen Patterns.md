**Type:** `Zang Fu`
**Nature:** `Mixed Excess-Deficiency` | `Neither`
**Location:** `Interior`

## 📋 Overview

Spleen Patterns in TCM encompass a range of imbalances related to the Spleen's vital functions. The Spleen is responsible for transforming and transporting food essences, extracting Qi from food, and distributing nutrients throughout the body. When the Spleen is deficient, it fails to adequately perform these tasks, leading to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, poor appetite, digestive issues, and the accumulation of dampness.

These patterns often involve both deficiency and excess aspects. The underlying deficiency of Spleen Qi leads to the inability to manage fluids, resulting in dampness accumulation, which further burdens the Spleen. Clinically, patients with Spleen Patterns typically present with fatigue, digestive complaints, and signs of dampness, such as a pale, swollen tongue with a greasy coating. Treatment focuses on tonifying the Spleen, strengthening its transformative functions, and resolving dampness.

## 🏷️ Pattern Classification

**System:** `Zang Fu`

- Hot/Cold: `Neither`
- Interior/Exterior: `Interior`
- Yin/Yang: `Yin`

## 🌱 Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
- Dietary Irregularity
- Overwork
- Chronic Illness
- Emotional Stress (Worry, Overthinking)
- Constitutional Weakness
- Excessive Dampness in the Environment

### Pathomechanisms
- Spleen Qi Deficiency
- Failure to Transform and Transport
- Dampness Accumulation
- Qi and Blood Deficiency
- Malnutrition of the Organs
- Ascent of Clear Qi Impaired
- Descent of Turbid Qi Impaired

**Development:**
Spleen Qi Deficiency typically develops gradually due to factors such as poor diet, overwork, or chronic illness. When the Spleen's Qi is weakened, its ability to transform and transport food essences is impaired. This leads to the accumulation of dampness, as the Spleen is unable to properly manage fluids. The dampness, in turn, further burdens the Spleen, creating a vicious cycle of deficiency and excess.

The Spleen's failure to ascend the clear Qi to the head results in symptoms like dizziness, fatigue, and blurred vision. Simultaneously, the impaired descent of turbid Qi leads to digestive disturbances such as loose stools, abdominal distention, and poor appetite. Over time, the Spleen's deficiency can lead to more severe manifestations, including edema, prolapse of organs, and general malnutrition.

Prolonged Spleen Qi Deficiency may also affect other organs. For example, the Spleen's inability to produce sufficient Qi and Blood can lead to Heart Blood Deficiency or Lung Qi Deficiency. The accumulated dampness can transform into phlegm, further complicating the clinical picture and impacting the Lung's function.

**Progression:**
Spleen deficiency can lead to the accumulation of dampness, further weakening Spleen function. It may also lead to deficiency in other organs due to the Spleen's role in nourishing the entire body.

**Common Transformations:**
- Pattern may transform into: [[Kidney Yang Deficiency]]
- May combine with: [[Liver Qi Stagnation]]

## 🏷️ Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
- Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
- Anemia
- Malabsorption
- Edema
- Hypothyroidism

**Biomedical Understanding:**
Many of the symptoms associated with Spleen Patterns overlap with Western medical conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and malabsorption disorders. Biomedical perspectives focus on factors like gut dysbiosis, inflammation, and hormonal imbalances to explain these conditions.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM pattern diagnosis can provide a more nuanced understanding of these conditions by identifying the underlying energetic imbalances. For example, TCM can differentiate between different types of IBS based on whether the primary imbalance is Spleen Qi Deficiency, Liver Qi Stagnation, or Damp-Heat. This allows for more targeted and effective treatment strategies.

## ✅ Classical Sources & Commentary

### Historical References
**First Appearance:**
- Source text: *Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic)*
- Reference: Various chapters discussing the functions of the Spleen

**Key Classical Quotes:**
> "The Spleen governs transformation and transportation. It is the root of postnatal Qi and blood."

### Traditional Understanding
In classical TCM, the Spleen is considered the foundation of postnatal Qi and blood, responsible for extracting and distributing nutrients from food. Spleen deficiency is seen as a fundamental weakness that can lead to a wide range of health problems.

### Modern Interpretation
Modern TCM practitioners emphasize the Spleen's role in digestion, immunity, and fluid metabolism. Spleen deficiency is often associated with modern lifestyle factors such as poor diet, stress, and lack of exercise.

## ✅ Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Always inquire about dietary habits when assessing Spleen patterns.
- Consider emotional factors, especially worry and overthinking.
- Palpate the abdomen for signs of distention or tenderness.

### Common Mistakes
- Overlooking the presence of dampness.
- Using overly strong tonifying herbs in patients with a weak digestive system.
- Neglecting dietary and lifestyle recommendations.

### Treatment Modifications
- **If the patient has significant dampness:** Add herbs that strongly drain dampness such as Yi Yi Ren or Che Qian Zi.
- **If the patient has significant cold:** Use warming herbs such as Gan Jiang or Rou Gui.

### Success Indicators
- Improved appetite
- More formed stools
- Increased energy levels
- Reduced abdominal distention
