## 📋 Overview

This pattern, commonly known as **Spleen and Stomach Disharmony (Pi Wei Bu He)**, is a foundational digestive disorder in TCM. It is a mixed pattern, simultaneously involving a deficiency of Spleen Qi and an excess condition of Qi Stagnation or Food Stagnation in the Stomach. The Spleen's function of transformation and transportation is impaired (deficiency), while the Stomach's function of receiving and descending is obstructed (excess), leading to a "traffic jam" in the Middle Jiao.

This disharmony is extremely common in modern clinical practice, often stemming from improper diet, chronic stress, or overthinking. It manifests with a combination of symptoms reflecting both deficiency (fatigue, poor appetite, loose stools) and excess (bloating, fullness, belching, nausea). Treatment must address both aspects by tonifying the Spleen while simultaneously regulating Qi and harmonizing the Stomach.

## 🌱 Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
- **Improper Diet:** Irregular eating habits, excessive consumption of cold, raw, greasy, or sweet foods.
- **Emotional Strain:** Chronic worry, pensiveness, or overthinking, which knots the Qi and injures the Spleen.
- **Chronic Illness:** Long-term illness can weaken the Middle Jiao, consuming Spleen Qi.
- **Overwork:** Physical or mental overexertion without adequate rest depletes the body's Qi, particularly that of the Spleen.

### Pathomechanisms
- Spleen Qi Deficiency leads to impaired Transformation and Transportation (T&T) of food and fluids, causing fatigue, poor appetite, and loose stools.
- Impaired T&T allows for the accumulation of Dampness or Food Stagnation in the Middle Jiao.
- This accumulation obstructs the Stomach's descending function, leading to Stomach Qi Stagnation or Rebellious Stomach Qi.
- The combination results in symptoms of both deficiency (Spleen) and excess (Stomach), such as fatigue alongside bloating and fullness.

**Development:**
The pattern usually begins with factors that weaken the Spleen, such as poor diet or emotional stress. The weakened Spleen fails to process food efficiently, leading to stagnation in the Stomach. This creates a vicious cycle where Spleen Deficiency leads to Stomach Stagnation, and the stagnation further burdens and weakens the Spleen.

**Progression:**
If left untreated, this disharmony can progress. The Spleen's failure to transform fluids can lead to the formation of Dampness or Phlegm. The Qi stagnation component can, over time, generate Heat or contribute to Blood Stasis. It can also be complicated by Liver Qi Stagnation invading the Spleen and Stomach.

**Common Transformations:**
- May transform into: [[Spleen and Stomach Damp-Heat]], [[Phlegm-Dampness Accumulation]]
- May combine with: [[Liver Qi Stagnation]], [[Spleen Qi Sinking]]

## 🔄 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | SP & ST Disharmony | Spleen Qi Deficiency | Liver Invading Spleen | Food Stagnation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chief Complaint | Bloating + Fatigue | Fatigue + Loose Stools | Bloating with emotional trigger | Acute bloating, foul belching |
| Pain/Distention | Fullness, distention | Dull, vague discomfort | Distention, cramping | Severe distention, pain |
| Stool | Loose | Loose, watery | Alternating constipation/diarrhea | Foul-smelling diarrhea or constipation |
| Pulse | Weak or Moderate | Weak | Wiry | Slippery, Full |
| Tongue | Pale, teeth marks | Pale, swollen, wet | Normal or pale sides, thin coat | Thick, greasy coat |
| Key Distinction | Mixed deficiency/excess | Primarily deficiency | Strong emotional link, wiry pulse | Acute onset after eating, thick coat |

**vs. [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]]:**
- This is the root of the Disharmony pattern. Pure Spleen Qi Deficiency is characterized primarily by deficiency signs (fatigue, poor appetite, loose stools) without the prominent excess signs of bloating, fullness, and belching.

**vs. [[Liver Qi Stagnation Invading the Spleen]]:**
- This pattern has a strong emotional component. Symptoms like abdominal distention and bowel changes are directly triggered or worsened by stress. The pulse is characteristically wiry, which is the key sign of Liver Qi Stagnation.

**vs. [[Food Stagnation]]:**
- This is a pure excess pattern, usually with an acute onset after overeating. It features severe bloating, foul-smelling belching or flatulence, and a thick, greasy tongue coating. The underlying Spleen Qi is not necessarily deficient.

## 💊 Treatment Approach

### Treatment Principles
- Tonify Spleen Qi
- Harmonize the Stomach
- Regulate Qi in the Middle Jiao
- Promote the descending of Stomach Qi

### Representative Formulas

**Primary Formula:**
- [[Xiang Sha Liu Jun Zi Tang]] (Six Gentlemen Decoction with Aucklandia and Amomum) → The classic formula for this pattern. It's [[Si Jun Zi Tang]] (to tonify Spleen Qi) plus Chen Pi and Ban Xia (to resolve Phlegm and descend Stomach Qi) and Mu Xiang and Sha Ren (to move Qi and stop pain/distention).

**Alternative Formulas:**
- [[Shen Ling Bai Zhu San]] → Used when Dampness is a more prominent feature, causing persistent loose stools.
- [[Bao He Wan]] → Used when Food Stagnation is the primary excess component, with severe bloating and foul belching after meals.

## ⚠️ Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**
- Avoid using purely cloying, tonifying herbs without Qi-regulating herbs, as this can worsen stagnation.
- Avoid overly strong purgatives which can further damage Spleen Qi.

**Cautions:**
- Dietary modification is crucial for successful treatment. Patients must avoid foods that weaken the Spleen (cold, raw, greasy, sweet).
- Emotional regulation is important, especially managing worry and stress.

---

## 🔄 Pattern Variations & Combinations

### Common Variations
- **With Dampness:** More pronounced heavy feeling, sticky taste, thicker tongue coat. Add herbs like Yi Yi Ren, Cang Zhu.
- **With Food Stagnation:** Severe bloating, foul belching, thick greasy tongue coat. Add Shan Zha, Shen Qu, Mai Ya.
- **With Cold:** Abdominal pain relieved by warmth, preference for hot drinks, pale wet tongue. Add Gan Jiang, Gao Liang Jiang.

### Common Combinations
- **With [[Liver Qi Stagnation]]:** Signs of irritability, wiry pulse, sighing. Use a formula like [[Xiao Yao San]] or [[Chai Hu Shu Gan San]] as a base.

## 🏥 Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Functional Dyspepsia
- Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
- Chronic Gastritis
- Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
- Gastroparesis

**Biomedical Understanding:**
This pattern corresponds to functional disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Spleen Qi deficiency can be seen as impaired enzymatic production and motility, while Stomach Qi stagnation correlates with delayed gastric emptying, bloating, and visceral hypersensitivity. The interplay reflects a dysregulation of the gut-brain axis, often exacerbated by stress.

---

## 💡 Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Always ask about the relationship between symptoms and eating. If bloating is significantly worse after meals, this pattern is highly likely.
- The combination of fatigue (deficiency) and bloating (excess) is the hallmark of this pattern.
- Dietary advice is not optional; it is a primary therapy for this condition.
- A weak (Ru) or moderate (Huan) pulse is key to differentiating this from a Liver-Spleen disharmony (Wiry pulse).

### Common Mistakes
- Focusing only on tonifying the Spleen without moving Stomach Qi. This will make the bloating worse.
- Mistaking this for Liver Invading Spleen. Check the pulse carefully; a wiry pulse points to the Liver.
- Neglecting to address underlying emotional factors like worry and stress.

### Success Indicators
- Reduction in bloating and abdominal fullness.
- Improved appetite and energy levels.
- Normalization of bowel movements.
- Tongue becomes less pale and teeth marks diminish.
