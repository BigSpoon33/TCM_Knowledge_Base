**Type:** `Zang Fu`
**Nature:** `Mixed Excess-Deficiency` | `Neither`
**Location:** `Interior`

## 📋 Overview

Liver Qi Invading Stomach (LV → ST) describes a disharmony where Liver Qi stagnation disrupts the normal function of the Stomach. The Liver, governed by Wood element, has a controlling relationship with the Earth element represented by the Spleen and Stomach. When Liver Qi stagnates due to emotional stress or other factors, it can overact on the Stomach, impairing its ability to receive, rot, and ripen food.

This pattern is characterized by a combination of Liver Qi stagnation symptoms (such as costal and hypochondriac pain, irritability, and depression) and Stomach Qi dysfunction symptoms (such as epigastric distension, belching, and acid regurgitation). The Liver's influence disrupts the Stomach's function of descending Qi, leading to rebellious Stomach Qi. This is a common pattern in modern clinical practice, often associated with stress and irregular dietary habits.

## 🏷️ Pattern Classification

**System:** `Zang Fu`
**Subtype:** `Liver/Stomach`

**Eight Principles Analysis:**
- Excess/Deficiency: `Mixed Excess-Deficiency`
- Hot/Cold: `Neither`
- Interior/Exterior: `Interior`
- Yin/Yang: `Yin`

---

## 🌱 Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
- Emotional stress (especially anger, frustration, resentment)
- Prolonged mental strain and worry
- Irregular eating habits (skipping meals, eating at irregular times)
- Diet high in spicy, greasy, or processed foods
- Suppression of emotions, leading to chronic Liver Qi stagnation
- Pre-existing Liver Qi Stagnation failing to resolve

### Pathomechanisms
- **Liver Qi Stagnation Impacts Stomach Function:** The Liver governs the smooth flow of Qi throughout the body. When Liver Qi stagnates due to emotional factors, this stagnation impedes the Stomach's ability to function properly. The Liver's Wood element overcontrols the Stomach's Earth element, disrupting its natural processes.

- **Impaired Stomach Qi Descending:** The Stomach's primary function is to receive food and drink and then to descend Qi downward to the Small Intestine for further digestion and absorption. Liver Qi stagnation obstructs this descending function, causing Stomach Qi to rebel upwards, leading to belching, acid regurgitation, and nausea.

- **Disharmony Between Liver and Stomach:** The Liver and Stomach need to work in harmony for proper digestion. The Liver ensures a smooth flow of Qi, allowing the Stomach to perform its function efficiently. Liver Qi stagnation disrupts this harmonious relationship, creating digestive disturbances. This disruption impairs the Spleen's ability to transform and transport fluids, potentially leading to dampness accumulation.

**Development:**
The pattern typically begins with emotional stress or dietary irregularities that cause Liver Qi to stagnate. This stagnation then affects the Stomach, initially manifesting as mild epigastric distension and occasional belching. If the underlying cause is not addressed, the pattern becomes chronic, leading to more pronounced symptoms.

**Progression:**
Liver Qi Stagnation initially affects Stomach Qi, leading to digestive dysfunction. Over time, this can deplete Stomach Yin or lead to Blood Stasis.

**Common Transformations:**
- Pattern may transform into: [[Liver Fire Ascending]]
- May combine with: [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]]

## 🔄 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | This Pattern | Similar Pattern 1 | Similar Pattern 2 |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Chief symptom | Epigastric pain, belching | Epigastric pain, fullness | Epigastric pain, burning |
| Tongue | Thin coating | Thick coating | Red tongue, little coating |
| Pulse | Wiry | Slippery | Rapid |
| Key distinction | Emotional component, Liver signs | Food stagnation, no Liver signs | Heat signs, Stomach Yin Deficiency |

**vs. [[Food Stagnation]]:**
- Key difference: Food Stagnation is primarily caused by overeating or consuming difficult-to-digest foods, lacking the emotional and Liver-related components seen in Liver Qi Invading Stomach.

**vs. [[Stomach Heat]]:**
- Key difference: Stomach Heat presents with a burning sensation in the epigastrium, thirst, and a red tongue with a yellow coating, indicating a heat pattern rather than the Qi stagnation and emotional factors of Liver Qi Invading Stomach.

## 🏷️ Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Gastritis
- Peptic Ulcer Disease
- GERD
- Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
- Anxiety
- Depression

**Biomedical Understanding:**
Western medicine recognizes the role of stress and emotional factors in gastrointestinal disorders. Conditions like IBS are often associated with heightened sensitivity in the digestive tract and altered gut motility. GERD involves the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus, which can be exacerbated by stress and dietary factors.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM pattern diagnosis provides a framework for understanding the underlying imbalances contributing to these Western medical conditions. Liver Qi Invading Stomach can explain the functional disturbances and emotional components often seen in these disorders. TCM treatment focuses on addressing the root cause of the imbalance, rather than just managing the symptoms.

---

## ✅ Classical Sources & Commentary

### Historical References
**First Appearance:**
- Source text: Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic)
- Reference: Discussions on Liver and Stomach disharmony can be found throughout the text, but the specific pattern is elaborated upon in later commentaries.

**Key Classical Quotes:**
> "When the Liver is constrained, the Spleen is weakened." (Implies Liver's influence on digestive function).

### Traditional Understanding
Traditionally, this pattern is understood as a disruption of the Wood-Earth relationship in the Five Element theory. The Liver's Wood element is meant to control the Spleen's Earth element in a balanced way. When the Liver Qi stagnates, this control becomes excessive, weakening the Spleen and disrupting the Stomach's function.

### Modern Interpretation
Modern TCM practitioners recognize the importance of emotional and lifestyle factors in the development of this pattern. Stress, poor diet, and lack of exercise are seen as major contributors. Treatment focuses on addressing these factors through acupuncture, herbal medicine, and lifestyle recommendations.

---

## ✅ Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Always inquire about the patient's emotional state and stress levels.
- Palpate the abdomen for areas of tenderness or distension, particularly in the epigastric and hypochondriac regions.
- Consider the patient's dietary habits and make appropriate recommendations.

### Common Mistakes
- Overlooking the emotional component of the pattern and focusing solely on the digestive symptoms.
- Prescribing strong Qi-moving herbs without addressing underlying Spleen Qi Deficiency.
- Neglecting dietary and lifestyle recommendations.

### Treatment Modifications
- **If Spleen Qi Deficiency is prominent:** Add herbs like Huang Qi (Astragalus) and Bai Zhu (Atractylodes) to tonify Qi and strengthen the Spleen.
- **If there is concurrent Blood Stasis:** Add herbs like Dan Shen (Salvia) and Chuan Xiong (Ligusticum) to invigorate Blood and dispel stasis.

### Success Indicators
- Reduced epigastric pain and distension
- Decreased belching and acid regurgitation
- Improved mood and emotional stability
- Regular bowel movements
