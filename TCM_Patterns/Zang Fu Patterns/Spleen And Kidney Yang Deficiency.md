- Pregnancy (use caution with warming herbs)

**Cautions:**

## 🏷️ Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Chronic Diarrhea
- Hypothyroidism
- Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
- Nephrotic Syndrome
- Edema of unknown origin

**Biomedical Understanding:**
Western medicine may identify conditions such as hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) or adrenal fatigue, which can manifest with symptoms similar to Spleen and Kidney Yang Deficiency. Chronic diarrhea may be investigated for underlying causes like inflammatory bowel disease or malabsorption syndromes.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM pattern diagnosis provides a more holistic and individualized approach to treatment compared to Western medical diagnoses. While Western medicine focuses on identifying specific diseases, TCM focuses on identifying the underlying patterns of imbalance that contribute to the symptoms. TCM can offer valuable therapeutic options for patients with chronic conditions that are not adequately addressed by Western medicine alone.


## ✅ Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Always inquire about the patient's bowel movements, urine output, and sensitivity to cold.
- Palpate the abdomen for signs of Cold and Dampness, such as a cold sensation or distension.
- Use moxibustion on acupuncture points to enhance the warming and tonifying effects.

### Common Mistakes
- Overlooking the importance of dietary recommendations.
- Using overly drying herbs, which can further deplete Yin.
- Neglecting to address emotional factors that may be contributing to the pattern.

### Treatment Modifications
- **If patient has a strong aversion to taking herbs**: Use acupuncture and moxibustion as the primary treatment modality.
- **If patient experiences constipation:** Add herbs that moisten the intestines and promote bowel movements.

### Success Indicators
- Improvement in bowel movements (more formed stools, less diarrhea).
- Increased energy levels and reduced fatigue.
- Reduced sensitivity to cold and improved warmth in the limbs.
