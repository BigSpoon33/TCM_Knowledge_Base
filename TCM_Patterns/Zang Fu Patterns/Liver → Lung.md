##  Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**

- Caution with cold and bitter herbs in patients with Spleen Qi deficiency
- Avoid spicy and greasy foods during treatment

**Cautions:**
- Monitor the patient closely for signs of Spleen Qi deficiency when using cold and bitter herbs.
- Adjust the herbal formula based on the patient's individual presentation and underlying constitution.

**When to Avoid:**
- Avoid using strong Liver-draining herbs if the patient is pregnant.


## 🏷️ Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Bronchitis
- Asthma
- Pneumonia
- Hypertension
- GERD

**Biomedical Understanding:**
Biomedically, conditions like bronchitis and asthma involve inflammation and constriction of the airways, leading to coughing and difficulty breathing. Hypertension and GERD can be exacerbated by stress and emotional factors, which can also contribute to inflammation in the body.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM pattern diagnosis can help identify the underlying causes of respiratory and cardiovascular issues by considering the emotional and lifestyle factors contributing to the Liver Fire and Lung dysfunction. This allows for a more holistic and personalized treatment approach.


## ✅ Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Always inquire about the patient's emotional state and stress levels.
- Examine the tongue coating carefully to assess the severity of the heat.
- Consider the patient's dietary habits, especially their intake of spicy and greasy foods.

### Common Mistakes
- Focusing solely on the Lung symptoms without addressing the underlying Liver disharmony.
- Using excessively cold herbs without considering the potential for damaging the Spleen Qi.

### Treatment Modifications
- **If cough is dry:** Add herbs that moisten the Lungs, such as Mai Men Dong and Tian Hua Fen.
- **If patient has significant emotional distress:** Consider adding herbs that calm the spirit, such as Suan Zao Ren and Ye Jiao Teng.

### Success Indicators
- Reduction in coughing and chest pain.
- Improved emotional state and reduced irritability.
- Return of the tongue coating to a more normal color and thickness.
