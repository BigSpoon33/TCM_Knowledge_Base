## Overview

Spleen Qi Deficiency is a fundamental pattern in TCM, describing a weakened state of the Spleen's function, specifically its ability to transform and transport food and fluids, extract Qi and Blood from food, and govern the ascending of clear Qi. This pattern reflects a state of undernourishment and reduced vitality, significantly impacting energy levels, digestion, and overall well-being.  The Spleen, in TCM, is often considered the "Root of Post-Heaven Qi" because it is responsible for extracting Qi from the food we eat, therefore when the Spleen is deficient, the body lacks the fundamental energy for life.

Clinically, Spleen Qi Deficiency manifests as fatigue, poor appetite, loose stools, and a pale complexion.  Patients may experience abdominal distention after eating, weakness in the limbs, and a general lack of vitality.  Because the Spleen governs the muscles, weakness and fatigue can be a main clinical presentation. Because the Spleen is in charge of transformation and transportation, deficiency can lead to dampness. Because the Spleen holds up the organs, deficiency can lead to prolapse.  Emotional symptoms such as excessive worry and forgetfulness can also be prominent, reflecting the Spleen's association with the intellect and mental clarity. Effective treatment focuses on tonifying Spleen Qi and strengthening the digestive function to restore balance and vitality.

- Interior/Exterior: `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`

## Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
- Diet: Irregular eating habits, consumption of excessive raw, cold, greasy, or processed foods which impair Spleen's digestive function.
- Overthinking and Worry: Excessive mental activity and worry deplete Spleen Qi, hindering its ability to transform and transport.
- Chronic Illness: Prolonged illness weakens the Spleen, impairing its ability to generate Qi and Blood.
- Overwork: Physical and mental overexertion depletes Qi and exhausts the Spleen's resources.
- Emotional Stress: Repressed emotions and chronic stress can affect the Spleen's function.
- Constitutional Weakness: Some individuals are born with a weaker Spleen Qi due to hereditary factors.

### Pathomechanisms
- The Spleen's primary function is to transform and transport food and fluids, extracting Qi and Blood for the body's nourishment. When the Spleen is deficient, this process is impaired, leading to a lack of essential nutrients and energy. The failure to properly transform food and fluids results in the accumulation of dampness within the body, which further burdens the Spleen and exacerbates the deficiency.

- The deficiency in Qi and Blood production leads to a general lack of vitality, manifesting as fatigue, weakness, and a pale complexion. The Spleen also governs the muscles; therefore, a deficiency can lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, and heavy limbs. The failure of the Spleen to ascend the clear Qi can result in symptoms such as dizziness, blurred vision, and a feeling of heaviness in the head.

- Furthermore, the Spleen is responsible for holding organs in place and preventing prolapse. When Spleen Qi is deficient, its ability to hold the organs weakens, leading to prolapse of organs such as the uterus or rectum. This lack of support can also contribute to conditions like hemorrhoids and varicose veins. The deficiency can also impair the Spleen's role in governing the Blood, leading to conditions like excessive uterine bleeding or easy bruising. Overall, Spleen Qi deficiency creates a vicious cycle of impaired digestion, reduced nutrient absorption, dampness accumulation, and decreased vitality, leading to a wide range of symptoms and health complications.

**Development:** Spleen Qi Deficiency can develop gradually over time due to dietary habits, lifestyle factors, or chronic illness. It may initially present with subtle symptoms that become more pronounced as the deficiency progresses.

**Progression:** Can lead to Spleen Yang Deficiency or Spleen Blood Deficiency if unaddressed. Can contribute to Dampness accumulation. Can lead to prolapse disorders.

**Common Transformations:**
- Pattern may transform into: [[Spleen Yang Deficiency]]
- May combine with: [[Dampness Obstructing the Spleen]]

## Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**
- Use caution with strongly draining or cooling herbs as these can further weaken the Spleen.
- Avoid over-stimulating the Spleen with excessive tonification, as this can lead to stagnation.

**Cautions:**
- Avoid raw, cold foods during treatment, as these can further impair Spleen function.
- Advise patients to avoid excessive worry and overthinking, as this can deplete Spleen Qi.

**When to Avoid:**
- In cases of acute infection or fever, focus on addressing the acute condition before tonifying the Spleen.

---

## Pattern Variations & Combinations

### Common Variations
- **With Dampness:** When Spleen Qi Deficiency is accompanied by Dampness, symptoms such as a sticky tongue coating, edema, and a feeling of heaviness in the body may be more pronounced. Use formulas like Shen Ling Bai Zhu San.
- **With Qi Sinking:** When Spleen Qi Deficiency leads to Qi Sinking, symptoms such as prolapse of organs and fatigue worsen when standing may be present. Use formulas like Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang.

### Common Combinations
- **With [[Lung Qi Deficiency]]:** The Lungs and Spleen are closely related in TCM, so a deficiency in one can affect the other, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and a weak voice. Treatment should address both Lung and Spleen Qi.
- **With [[Kidney Qi Deficiency]]:** A prolonged Spleen Qi Deficiency can weaken the Kidneys, leading to symptoms such as lower back pain, frequent urination, and fatigue. Treatment should focus on tonifying both Spleen and Kidney Qi.

## Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
- Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
- Anemia
- Malabsorption
- Edema
- Postpartum fatigue
- Fibromyalgia
- Immune Deficiency
- GERD
- Gastritis

**Biomedical Understanding:**
Biomedically, these conditions are often associated with impaired digestion, nutrient absorption, and energy production. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is characterized by persistent fatigue and other symptoms, while IBS involves abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. Anemia results from a deficiency in red blood cells, leading to fatigue and weakness. Malabsorption refers to the impaired absorption of nutrients from the digestive tract.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM pattern diagnosis provides a more holistic understanding of these conditions, identifying the underlying imbalances in Qi, Blood, and organ function. By addressing the specific pattern, such as Spleen Qi Deficiency, TCM treatment can help restore balance and alleviate symptoms that may not be fully addressed by Western medical approaches alone.

## Classical Sources & Commentary

### Historical References
**First Appearance:**
- Source text: *Shang Han Lun* (Treatise on Cold Damage) and *Jin Gui Yao Lue* (Essentials from the Golden Cabinet)
- Reference: These texts discuss the importance of the Spleen and Stomach in maintaining health and the consequences of their dysfunction.

**Key Classical Quotes:**
> "The Spleen governs transformation and transportation; it is the root of Post-Heaven Qi." (From *Su Wen*)

### Traditional Understanding
In TCM, the Spleen is considered the "Earth" element and is responsible for transforming food into Qi and Blood, distributing nutrients throughout the body, and maintaining the proper functioning of the digestive system. Spleen Qi Deficiency is understood as a weakening of this vital function, leading to a range of physical and emotional symptoms.

### Modern Interpretation
Modern TCM practitioners view Spleen Qi Deficiency as a common pattern resulting from various lifestyle and environmental factors. Treatment focuses on restoring the Spleen's function, promoting healthy digestion, and supporting overall vitality.
