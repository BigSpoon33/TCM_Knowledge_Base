# `=this.name`

**Type:** `Zang Fu`
**Nature:** `Mixed Excess-Deficiency` | `Neither`
**Location:** `Interior`


## 🏷️ Pattern Classification

**System:** `Zang Fu`
**Subtype:** `Stomach`

**Eight Principles Analysis:**
- Excess/Deficiency: `Mixed Excess-Deficiency`
- Hot/Cold: `Neither`
- Interior/Exterior: `Interior`
- Yin/Yang: `Yin`


## 🔍 Clinical Manifestations

### Cardinal Symptoms (CAM)
**Essential Symptoms:**
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Belching
- Hiccups

### Complete Symptom Picture

**Chief Symptoms:**
- Nausea
- Vomiting (may be clear fluids, undigested food, or phlegm)
- Belching (frequent and often loud)

**Accompanying Symptoms:**
- Hiccups
- Epigastric distention or fullness
- Poor appetite
- Acid reflux or heartburn
- Irritability or frustration (especially if Liver Qi is involved)
- Aversion to cold (if Cold is involved)
- Feeling of heaviness (if Dampness is involved)

**Tongue:** May be normal color, or slightly red on the sides. Coat can be thin and white, or slightly greasy depending on contributing factors like Phlegm-Damp.

**Pulse:** Wiry (Xian) or Slippery (Hua) depending on contributing factors. May be Weak (Ruo) in the right middle position if there is Spleen Qi Deficiency.


## 🔄 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | This Pattern | Similar Pattern 1 | Similar Pattern 2 |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Chief symptom | Nausea, Vomiting, Belching, Hiccups | Nausea, Vomiting, Distention (more prominent) | Nausea, Vomiting, Abdominal Pain |
| Tongue | Normal to slightly red, possibly greasy coat | Thick, greasy coat | Pale with a white coat |
| Pulse | Wiry or Slippery | Slippery, forceful | Weak |
| Key distinction | Primarily upward movement of Qi | Primarily Food Stagnation | Primarily Spleen Qi Deficiency leading to maldigestion |

**vs. [[Food Stagnation]]:**
- Key difference: Food Stagnation is primarily due to undigested food accumulating in the Stomach, leading to foul-smelling belching and a feeling of fullness that is relieved by vomiting. Stomach Qi Rebelling Upwards can be caused by various factors and may not always involve the presence of undigested food in the vomit.

**vs. [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]]:**
- Key difference: Spleen Qi Deficiency primarily involves weakness of the digestive function, leading to poor appetite, fatigue, and loose stools. While Spleen Qi Deficiency can contribute to Stomach Qi Rebelling Upwards over time, the primary symptom is digestive weakness, not the upward movement of Qi. The pulse is also typically weak.


### Key Herbs

**Essential Herbs for This Pattern:**
- [[Ban Xia]] – Transforms Phlegm, dries Dampness, and directs Qi downwards. Dosage: 3-9g
- [[Chen Pi]] – Regulates Qi, dries Dampness, and strengthens the Spleen. Dosage: 3-9g
- [[Ding Xiang]] – Warms the Middle Jiao, directs Qi downwards, and stops vomiting. Dosage: 1-3g (Use with caution in cases of Heat)
- [[Shi Di]] – Strongly directs Qi downwards and stops hiccups. Dosage: 3-9g

##  Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**
- Use caution with warming herbs in cases of underlying Yin Deficiency
- Avoid strong purgatives if there is already weakness.

**Cautions:**
- Adjust formula based on specific presentation; e.g., avoid warming herbs in cases of underlying Yin Deficiency
- Avoid greasy, difficult-to-digest foods.
- Monitor patients for signs of dehydration if vomiting is severe.

**When to Avoid:**
- Avoid strong tonics if there is significant Food Stagnation.


## 🏷️ Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Gastritis
- Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
- Hiatal Hernia
- Gastroparesis
- Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome

**Biomedical Understanding:**
In Western medicine, these conditions are often related to inflammation of the stomach lining, dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter, or delayed gastric emptying. Medications such as antacids, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetics are commonly used to manage symptoms.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM pattern diagnosis allows for a more nuanced understanding of the underlying imbalances contributing to digestive symptoms. For example, TCM can differentiate between GERD caused by Stomach Heat versus GERD caused by Liver Qi invading the Stomach, leading to more targeted treatment strategies.


## ✅ Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Always inquire about emotional factors, as stress and frustration are common contributing causes.
- Assess the tongue coat carefully to determine if Phlegm-Damp is involved.
- Consider the patient's dietary habits and advise them on making appropriate changes.

### Common Mistakes
- Neglecting to address underlying Spleen Qi Deficiency, which can perpetuate the pattern.
- Using overly strong descending herbs in cases of Yin Deficiency, which can further deplete the body's resources.

### Treatment Modifications
- **If Stomach Heat is present:** Add herbs that clear Heat, such as Zhu Ru (Bamboo Shavings).
- **If Spleen Qi Deficiency is present:** Add herbs that tonify Spleen Qi, such as Ren Shen (Ginseng) and Bai Zhu (White Atractylodes).

### Success Indicators
- Reduction in the frequency and intensity of nausea and vomiting.
- Improvement in appetite and digestion.
- Relief of epigastric distention.
