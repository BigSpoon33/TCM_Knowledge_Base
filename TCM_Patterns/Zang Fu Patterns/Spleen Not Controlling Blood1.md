# 🔮 Spleen Not Controlling Blood

**Type:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_type`
**Nature:** `= this.pattern_data.excess_deficiency` | `= this.pattern_data.hot_cold`
**Location:** `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`

## 📖 Overview

**Spleen Not Controlling Blood** (脾不统血, Pí Bù Tǒng Xuè) is a Deficiency pattern where the Spleen's function of holding Blood within the vessels is impaired. This is a direct consequence of severe or chronic [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]]. The Spleen governs the transformation and transportation of Gu Qi, the basis for Qi and Blood production. A primary function of Qi is to contain and manage the body's fluids, including Blood. When Spleen Qi is deficient, this containing function weakens, allowing Blood to extravasate, leading to various types of chronic, low-grade bleeding.

This pattern presents a classic TCM paradox: a "deficiency at the root, with an excess at the branch." The root cause is Spleen Qi Deficiency, while the branch manifestation is the "excess" of bleeding. Therefore, treatment must focus on tonifying the Spleen to address the root cause, rather than just using hemostatic herbs to stop the bleeding branch symptom. This pattern is commonly seen in gynecological and hematological disorders.

## 🎯 Pattern Classification

**System:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_type`
**Subtype:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_subtype`

**Eight Principles Analysis:**
- Excess/Deficiency: `= this.pattern_data.excess_deficiency` (Root Deficiency causing a branch manifestation of bleeding)
- Hot/Cold: `= this.pattern_data.hot_cold`
- Interior/Exterior: `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`
- Yin/Yang: `= this.pattern_data.yin_yang`

## 🧬 Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
- Chronic [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]]
- Poor diet (irregular eating, excessive cold/raw foods)
- Overwork and physical exhaustion
- Excessive worry and mental strain
- Chronic illness weakening the Middle Jiao

### Pathomechanisms
- Spleen Qi is too weak to perform its function of 'Tong Xue' (controlling/managing Blood)
- The containing function of Qi is impaired, allowing Blood to leak or 'extravasate' from the vessels
- Deficiency of Spleen Qi fails to generate sufficient Blood, often leading to co-existing Blood Deficiency

**Development:**
The pattern develops from a foundation of [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]]. As the Spleen Qi becomes progressively weaker, it loses its ability to govern Blood circulation effectively. This is not a failure of blood movement (like stasis) but a failure of containment. The blood, no longer held in check by Qi, seeps out of the vessels, manifesting as bleeding that is typically chronic and pale in color.

**Progression:**
`= this.pattern_data.disease_progression`

**Common Transformations:**
- Can progress to severe [[Blood Deficiency]] or [[Heart Blood Deficiency]] due to chronic blood loss.
- In severe cases, it can contribute to [[Qi and Blood Deficiency]] or even [[Yang Collapse]] if bleeding is profuse and uncontrolled.

## 🩺 Clinical Manifestations

### Original Source Symptoms
- Pale complexion
- Lassitude
- Dislike of speaking
- Purpura
- Blood spots under the skin
- Bloody stools
- Excessive menstrual flow
- Uterine bleeding in women
- Sallow complexion and S.O.B. (Shortness of Breath)

### Complete Symptom Picture

**Chief Symptoms (Bleeding):**
- **Purpura:** Blood spots or bruising under the skin that appear without significant trauma.
- **Menstrual Issues:** Menorrhagia (excessive menstrual flow), metrorrhagia (uterine bleeding between periods), or a continuously trickling flow. Blood is typically pale and thin.
- **Gastrointestinal Bleeding:** Blood in the stool (hematochezia), which may be tarry if from higher up or fresher if lower down.
- **Other bleeding:** Hematuria (blood in urine), epistaxis (nosebleeds), or bleeding gums.

**Accompanying Symptoms (Spleen Qi Deficiency):**
- Lassitude, fatigue, weakness
- Pale or sallow complexion
- Shortness of breath (S.O.B.), dislike of speaking
- Poor appetite, abdominal bloating after eating
- Loose stools
- Dizziness, lightheadedness

**Tongue:** `= this.pattern_data.tongue` (May also be slightly swollen with teeth marks)

**Pulse:** `= this.pattern_data.pulse`

## 🔍 Diagnostic Criteria

### Must Have (Essential)
1.  Chronic, recurring bleeding (e.g., purpura, menorrhagia, blood in stool).
2.  Clear signs of [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]] (fatigue, poor appetite, weakness).
3.  Pale tongue and a thready, weak pulse.

### Usually Has (Common)
- Pale or sallow complexion
- Loose stools or poor digestion
- Shortness of breath, especially on exertion

### May Have (Variable)
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Abdominal bloating
- A desire for warm food and drinks

## 🎯 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | Spleen Not Controlling Blood | Heat in the Blood | Blood Stasis Bleeding |
|---------|------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Bleeding | Chronic, pale, thin blood | Acute, profuse, bright red blood | Dark, clotted blood |
| Tongue | Pale | Red, crimson | Purple, dark spots |
| Pulse | Thready, weak | Rapid, forceful | Wiry, choppy, hesitant |
| Key distinction | Co-existing Qi deficiency signs | Co-existing Heat signs (thirst, fever) | Fixed, stabbing pain |

**vs. [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]]:**
- This is the root pattern of Spleen Not Controlling Blood. The key difference is the *presence of bleeding*. Spleen Qi Deficiency has all the fatigue and digestive signs but without the extravasation of blood.

**vs. [[Heat in the Blood]]:**
- Heat agitates the blood, forcing it to move recklessly out of the vessels. This leads to acute, profuse bleeding of bright red blood. The patient will exhibit signs of heat like a red tongue, rapid pulse, thirst, and a feeling of heat. In contrast, Spleen deficiency bleeding is chronic, pale, and accompanied by signs of deficiency and cold.

**vs. [[Blood Stasis]]:**
- Blood Stasis can obstruct vessels, causing them to rupture and bleed. This bleeding is characterized by dark, purplish blood with clots, and is almost always accompanied by fixed, stabbing pain. The tongue is purple, not pale.

## 💊 Treatment Approach

### Treatment Principles
- Tonify Spleen Qi
- Nourish Blood
- Consolidate and Contain Blood
- Stop Bleeding

### Representative Formulas

**Primary Formula:**
- [[Gui Pi Tang]] (Restore the Spleen Decoction) → The classic formula for this pattern, especially when Heart Blood Deficiency symptoms like insomnia and anxiety are also present. It tonifies both Spleen Qi and Heart Blood.

**Alternative Formulas:**
- [[Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang]] (Tonify the Middle and Augment the Qi Decoction) → Can be modified to treat this pattern by adding hemostatic herbs. It is excellent for raising Qi and is used when there is organ prolapse alongside bleeding.

### Acupuncture Points

**Primary Points:**
- [[SP-1 (Yin Bai)]] → Empirical distal point to stop bleeding, especially uterine. Often treated with moxibustion.
- [[ST-36 (Zu San Li)]] → Tonifies Spleen and Stomach Qi, builds Qi and Blood.
- [[UB-20 (Pi Shu)]] → Back-Shu point of the Spleen, directly tonifies Spleen Qi at the root.
- [[RN-12 (Zhong Wan)]] → Front-Mu point of the Stomach, strengthens the Middle Jiao.

**Supporting Points:**
- [[UB-17 (Ge Shu)]] → Influential point of Blood, nourishes Blood and can help stop bleeding.
- [[SP-10 (Xue Hai)]] → "Sea of Blood," moves and nourishes blood; used here to harmonize blood rather than invigorate it strongly.
- [[SP-6 (San Yin Jiao)]] → Tonifies Spleen, Liver, and Kidney; nourishes Yin and Blood.
- [[SP-3 (Tai Bai)]] → Yuan-Source point of the Spleen, strengthens Spleen's transformative function.
- [[UB-21 (Wei Shu)]] → Back-Shu of the Stomach, supports the Middle Jiao with UB-20.

**Point Combinations:**
- [Uterine Bleeding]: Moxa on [[SP-1]] + [[SP-6 (San Yin Jiao)]] + [[RN-4]]
- [General Qi Deficiency]: [[ST-36]] + [[RN-12]] + [[UB-20]]
- [To Nourish and Harmonize Blood]: [[UB-17]] + [[SP-10]] + [[SP-6 (San Yin Jiao)]]

## ⚠️ Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**
- Avoid strongly blood-invigorating herbs (e.g., Hong Hua, Tao Ren) as they will worsen bleeding.
- Avoid pungent, dispersing herbs that could further weaken the containing function of Qi.

**Cautions:**
- Use caution with rich, cloying, tonifying herbs (like Shu Di Huang) as they can be difficult for a weak Spleen to digest and may cause bloating.
- Monitor the patient for any signs of acute, severe hemorrhage, which would be a medical emergency.

**When to Avoid:**
- Self-treatment for any significant bleeding is not advised. This pattern requires professional diagnosis and management.

## 🔄 Pattern Variations & Combinations

### Common Variations
- **With Yang Deficiency:** More pronounced cold signs, cold limbs, preference for warmth, deep weak pulse. Add warming herbs like Pao Jiang or Ai Ye.

### Common Combinations
- **With [[Heart Blood Deficiency]]:** The classic presentation for [[Gui Pi Tang]]. In addition to bleeding and fatigue, there will be palpitations, anxiety, insomnia, and dream-disturbed sleep.
- **With [[Kidney Qi Not Firm]]:** Often seen in urinary bleeding (hematuria) or uterine bleeding with accompanying signs of Kidney deficiency like low back pain, frequent urination, or tinnitus.

---

## 🏥 Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), including ITP
- Functional Uterine Bleeding (Menorrhagia, Metrorrhagia)
- Anemia (due to chronic blood loss)
- Bleeding ulcers or other GI bleeding
- Certain bleeding disorders or easy bruising

**Biomedical Understanding:**
This pattern correlates with conditions where hemostasis is impaired due to functional, rather than structural, issues. For example, in functional uterine bleeding, hormonal imbalances disrupt the normal cycle, which TCM views as a failure of the Chong and Ren Mai, rooted in Spleen and Kidney deficiency. In thrombocytopenia, the body lacks sufficient platelets for clotting, which TCM can interpret as Qi failing to command and contain the Blood. The TCM approach aims to restore the body's own homeostatic and hematopoietic functions.

## 💡 Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Moxibustion on [[SP-1]] is a cornerstone of treatment for Spleen-deficiency uterine bleeding. It is remarkably effective.
- Always treat the root (Spleen Qi Deficiency) and the branch (bleeding) simultaneously. Using only hemostatic herbs will not provide a lasting cure.
- Assess the patient's diet and lifestyle. Addressing overwork, worry, and poor eating habits is crucial for long-term recovery.

### Common Mistakes
- Mistaking this for a Heat pattern and using cooling hemostatic herbs, which will further damage Spleen Yang and worsen the condition.
- Focusing solely on stopping the bleeding without tonifying the Spleen, leading to recurrent episodes.
- Using strong blood-moving herbs for accompanying symptoms like bloating, which would exacerbate the bleeding.

### Treatment Modifications
- **For heavy uterine bleeding:** Add charred herbs like Pu Huang (Tan), Ai Ye (Tan), and hemostatics like E Jiao and Xian He Cao.
- **If Blood Deficiency is severe:** Increase the dosage of Dang Gui and add Shu Di Huang (used with care) or Long Yan Rou.
- **If Qi sinking is present (prolapse):** Use [[Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang]] as the base formula.

### Success Indicators
- Cessation or significant reduction of bleeding.
- Improvement in energy levels and reduced fatigue.
- Improved complexion (from pale/sallow to having more luster).
- Normalization of appetite and digestion.
- Pulse gains more strength and the tongue color improves.
