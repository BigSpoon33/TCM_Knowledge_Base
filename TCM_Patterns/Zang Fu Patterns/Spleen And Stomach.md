##  Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**
- Avoidance of cold, raw, and greasy foods
- Overeating
- Excessive emotional stress
- Long-term use of antibiotics or other damaging medications without proper herbal support

**Cautions:**
- Be mindful of the patient's constitution when using strong tonifying herbs.
- Avoid over-treating with drying herbs in cases of Yin deficiency.
- Address emotional factors concurrently with herbal and acupuncture treatment.

**When to Avoid:**

## 🏷️ Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Gastritis
- Peptic Ulcer Disease
- Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
- Functional Dyspepsia
- GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)
- Malabsorption
- Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
- Anxiety Disorders

**Biomedical Understanding:**
Western medicine views these conditions through the lens of inflammation, digestive enzyme deficiencies, motility disorders, and visceral hypersensitivity. Gastritis and peptic ulcers involve inflammation or erosion of the stomach lining. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. Functional dyspepsia involves chronic indigestion without identifiable structural abnormalities. GERD results from acid reflux into the esophagus.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM pattern diagnosis offers a more nuanced understanding of these conditions by identifying the underlying imbalances in Qi, Blood, and the Zang Fu organs. TCM treatment focuses on addressing the root cause of the disharmony, restoring digestive function, and alleviating symptoms. Integrating TCM with Western medical approaches can provide a holistic and effective treatment strategy.


## ✅ Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Always inquire about dietary habits and emotional state to identify the root cause.
- Palpate the abdomen to assess for areas of tenderness or distension.
- Observe the tongue and pulse carefully for subtle signs of imbalance.

### Common Mistakes
- Focusing solely on symptom relief without addressing the underlying Qi deficiency.
- Using overly drying herbs in cases of Yin deficiency.
- Neglecting dietary and lifestyle recommendations.

### Treatment Modifications
- **If Damp-Heat is present:** Add herbs that clear heat and drain Dampness, such as Huang Qin and Huang Lian.
- **If Food Stagnation is severe:** Use stronger digestive herbs like Shan Zha and Lai Fu Zi.

### Success Indicators
- Improved appetite and digestion.
- Increased energy levels.
- Regular and formed stools.
