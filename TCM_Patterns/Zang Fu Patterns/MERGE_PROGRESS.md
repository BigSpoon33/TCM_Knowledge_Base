## 🔄 Still Need to Merge

### Empty: Files (Need to check what they contain)
- `Empty: Qi.md.backup` - Review content, determine merge target
- `Empty: Yang.md.backup` - Likely Spleen Yang Deficiency
- `Empty: Yin.md.backup` - Likely Stomach Yin Deficiency

## 📝 Lessons Learned

**CORRECT APPROACH:**
1. Read BOTH files (existing + backup)
2. Compare content
3. Add missing information to the existing file OR create new merged file
4. Keep acupuncture points, symptoms, formulas from ALL sources
5. Mark which source each piece of info came from (CAM, FCM, Full:, etc.)

**WRONG APPROACH (WHAT I DID BEFORE):**
- ❌ Just deleting files without reading them
- ❌ Assuming one file was "better" without comparing
- ❌ Not preserving unique content from each source

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Check remaining Empty: backup files
2. Break apart glob files (Heart Empty, Liver Full, etc.)
3. Merge duplicate pattern name variations (Liver Fire group, etc.)
