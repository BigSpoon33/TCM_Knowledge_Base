# `=this.name`

**Type:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_type`
**Nature:** `= this.pattern_data.excess_deficiency` | `= this.pattern_data.hot_cold`
**Location:** `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`

## 📋 Overview

The Ying Level Pattern represents a deeper stage of pathogenic invasion than the Wei Level, indicating that the pathogen has penetrated further into the interior of the body, consuming the Yin and disturbing the Shen (Spirit). This pattern is characterized by the presence of interior heat, Yin deficiency, and mental agitation. It arises when a Wei Level disorder is not resolved promptly, allowing the pathogen to transform into heat and penetrate deeper into the Nutritive-Qi (Ying) level. Clinically, it manifests as fever, especially at night, mental restlessness, insomnia, and a dry mouth with no desire to drink.

This pattern is significant in TCM diagnosis because it signifies a progression of the disease process, indicating a more severe depletion of Yin and potential damage to the internal organs. Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial to prevent further progression to the Blood Level, which represents an even deeper and more serious condition. Treatment focuses on clearing heat, nourishing Yin, and calming the Shen to restore balance and prevent further depletion of vital substances.

## 🌱 Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
- External Warm-Heat Pathogen
- Untreated Wei Level Disorder
- Penetration of Heat Inward
- Preexisting Yin Deficiency
- Emotional Stress Leading to Fire
- Diet High in Spicy or Greasy Foods

### Pathomechanisms
- **Invasion of the Ying Level:** An external warm-heat pathogen that isn't expelled at the Wei Level penetrates deeper into the body, reaching the Ying (Nutritive) Level.
- **Consumption of Yin and Fluids by Heat:** The intense heat generated by the pathogen directly consumes the Yin fluids of the body. This depletion of Yin leads to relative excess of Yang, creating a state of internal heat. The dryness associated with the depleted fluids leads to symptoms like dry mouth and throat.
- **Disturbance of the Shen by Heat:** The heat rises and disturbs the Shen (Spirit), which resides in the Heart. This disturbance manifests as mental restlessness, agitation, insomnia, and in severe cases, delirium or coma. The inability of the Yin to anchor the Yang contributes to this instability.
- **Blood Involvement:** The heat may begin to enter the blood level, causing spots on the skin and potentially leading to more severe blood-related symptoms. The Yin deficiency further weakens the body's ability to contain the heat within the Ying level, making blood involvement more likely.

**Development:**
The Ying Level Pattern typically develops when an external warm-heat pathogen is not addressed adequately at the Wei Level. The pathogen transforms into heat and penetrates inward, consuming the Yin fluids and disturbing the Shen. Preexisting Yin deficiency can predispose an individual to this pattern.

- Pattern may transform into: [[Blood Level Pattern]]
- May combine with: [[Yin Deficiency with Empty Heat]]

## 🔄 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | This Pattern | Similar Pattern 1 | Similar Pattern 2 |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Chief symptom | Fever at night, mental restlessness | High fever, aversion to heat | Night sweats, five-palm heat |
| Tongue | Deep-Red | Red with thick yellow coat | Red, peeled coat |
| Pulse | Thready, rapid | Forceful, rapid | Thready, rapid |
| Key distinction | Yin deficiency signs, normal mental state during day | Excess heat signs, agitation | Yin deficiency signs, no mental agitation |

**vs. [[Qi Level Pattern]]:**
- Key difference: Qi Level is generally a high fever during the day, aversion to heat, and a forceful pulse, whereas Ying Level features nocturnal fever, mental restlessness, and a thready pulse indicative of Yin deficiency.

**vs. [[Yin Deficiency with Empty Heat]]:**
- Key difference: Yin Deficiency with Empty Heat presents with night sweats and five-palm heat as prominent features, whereas Ying Level is characterized by fever, mental restlessness, and a history of external pathogenic invasion. Ying Level is more acute and severe.

## ✅ Treatment Approach

### Treatment Principles
- Clear Heat and Cool the Blood
- Nourish Yin and Generate Fluids
- Calm the Shen and Relieve Restlessness
- Promote Circulation of Qi and Blood
- Preserve Yin to Prevent Further Depletion
- Support Digestive Function to Aid Recovery

### Representative Formulas

**Primary Formula:**
- [[Qing Ying Tang (Clear the Nutritive Level Decoction)]]  Qing Ying Tang is the classic formula for clearing heat from the Ying level, nourishing Yin, and calming the Shen. Its ingredients directly address the key aspects of the pattern: heat, Yin deficiency, and mental disturbance.

**Alternative Formulas:**
- [[Xi Jiao Di Huang Tang (Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction)]]  If there is significant blood heat manifesting as skin eruptions or bleeding, Xi Jiao Di Huang Tang can be used to cool the blood and stop bleeding.
- [[Zhi Zi Chi Tang (Gardenia and Prepared Soybean Decoction)]]  For cases where the heat is primarily affecting the chest and causing restlessness, Zhi Zi Chi Tang can be considered.
