## 📋 Overview

Stomach Heat Blazing, also known as Stomach Fire, is a pure Excess Heat pattern affecting the Stomach Zang-Fu organ. It is characterized by intense Heat symptoms in the Middle Jiao and along the Stomach's Yang Ming channel pathway, which ascends to the head. This pattern disrupts the Stomach's primary functions of receiving and 'rotting and ripening' food, and its role in descending Qi. Clinically, it manifests with a burning epigastric pain, intense hunger, thirst, and symptoms of Heat flaring upwards such as bleeding gums, bad breath, and severe mental agitation.

The primary causes are dietary indiscretion—particularly overconsumption of spicy, fried, or alcoholic foods—and emotional stress, where constrained Liver Qi transforms into Fire and invades the Stomach. This pattern is considered a condition of repletion and can develop acutely. If chronic, the intense Fire can consume the body's Yin fluids, leading to a more complex mixed pattern of Excess Fire with underlying Yin Deficiency.

- `= this.pattern_data.etiology[2]`
- `= this.pattern_data.etiology[3]`

- `= this.pattern_data.pathomechanisms[3]`

**Development:**
This pattern typically arises from an accumulation of Heat in the Yang Ming (Stomach and Large Intestine) system. Dietary habits and emotional factors are the most common triggers. The Stomach, which prefers a moist environment, is easily affected by Dryness and Heat. When Fire develops, it rapidly disrupts the Qi mechanism, causing rebellious Stomach Qi (vomiting) and disturbing the Shen.

**Progression:**
`= this.pattern_data.disease_progression`

**Common Transformations:**
- Pattern may transform into: [[Stomach Yin Deficiency]], [[Large Intestine Dry-Heat]]
- May combine with: [[Phlegm-Fire Harassing the Stomach]], [[Liver Fire]]

## 🔄 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | Stomach Heat Blazing | Stomach Yin Deficiency | Liver Fire Invading Stomach |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Chief symptom | Burning pain, intense hunger | Dull pain, no appetite | Distending pain, acid reflux |
| Tongue | Red, thick yellow coat | Red, peeled, no coat | Red sides, thin yellow coat |
| Pulse | Surging, Rapid | Thready, Rapid | Wiry, Rapid |
| Key distinction| Pure Excess Heat signs | Empty-Heat, lack of coat | Wiry pulse, emotional trigger |

**vs. [[Stomach Yin Deficiency]]:**
- Key difference: Stomach Fire is Excess Heat with a thick yellow tongue coat and forceful pulse. Stomach Yin Deficiency is Deficiency Heat, with a peeled/uncoated red tongue, no appetite or hunger with an inability to eat, and a thready, rapid pulse.

**vs. [[Liver Fire Invading Stomach]]:**
- Key difference: Liver Fire has a strong emotional component (irritability, anger) and a pronounced Wiry (Xian) pulse. The pain is more distending. Stomach Fire is characterized by a Surging (Hong) pulse and more direct signs of Stomach heat like intense hunger.

**vs. [[Phlegm-Fire Harassing the Stomach]]:**
- Key difference: Phlegm-Fire will have signs of Phlegm, such as a thick, greasy yellow tongue coating, a Slippery (Hua) pulse, and potentially mental confusion, dizziness, or a feeling of oppression in the chest.

### Acupuncture Points

**Primary Points:**
- [[ST-44 (Nei Ting)]] → Ying-Spring point of the Stomach channel, the primary point to clear Stomach Heat and Fire.
- [[LI-4 (He Gu)]] → Clears Heat from the Yang Ming channels (LI and ST), powerfully drains Fire from the face and head.
- [[ST-36 (Zu San Li)]] → Regulates the Stomach and Spleen. Can be needled with a reducing method to clear Heat or reinforced to protect Stomach Qi.
- [[RN-12 (Zhong Wan)]] → Front-Mu point of the Stomach. Harmonizes the Middle Jiao and descends rebellious Qi.

**Supporting Points:**
- [[ST-45 (Li Dui)]] → Jing-Well point, for acute conditions and clearing heat from the opposite end of the channel, especially for mental symptoms like mania.
- [[PC-8 (Lao Gong)]] → Clears Heart Fire, very effective when Stomach Fire is harassing the Shen.
- [[ST-4 (Di Cang)]] & [[ST-6 (Jia Che)]] → Local points for channel symptoms like deviation of the mouth.
- [[LI-11 (Qu Chi)]] → Clears Heat from the entire body.

**Point Combinations:**
- [Epigastric Pain]: ST-44 + PC-6 + RN-12 → Clears Stomach Heat, regulates Qi, stops pain.
- [Mania/Mental Agitation]: ST-45 + HT-7 + PC-8 → Clears Fire and calms the Shen.
- [Bleeding Gums/Toothache]: ST-44 + LI-4 → Drains Fire from the Upper Jiao.

## ⚠️ Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**
- `= this.pattern_data.contraindications[0]`
- `= this.pattern_data.contraindications[1]`
- This pattern requires cooling herbs; avoid all warming, acrid, and spicy herbs and foods.

**Cautions:**
- Long-term use of cold, bitter herbs can damage Stomach and Spleen Yang Qi. Monitor for signs of developing cold or deficiency.
- Patients with underlying Spleen Qi deficiency may react poorly to strong Heat-clearing formulas. Protect the Spleen with herbs like Gan Cao or Da Zao.

**When to Avoid:**
- In patients with clear signs of Cold-Deficiency in the Middle Jiao (e.g., pale tongue, slow pulse, desire for warmth).

## 🔄 Pattern Variations & Combinations

### Common Variations
- **Stomach Fire with Food Stagnation:** Symptoms include foul-smelling belching, acid reflux with undigested food, and a thicker, greasier tongue coating. Add herbs to reduce food stagnation like Shan Zha, Shen Qu.
- **Stomach Fire generating Wind:** This is a severe progression, leading to symptoms like tremor, convulsions, or **deviation of the mouth**. Requires herbs that clear heat and extinguish internal wind (e.g., Gou Teng, Tian Ma).

### Common Combinations
- **With [[Stomach Yin Deficiency]]:** Occurs when chronic Fire consumes fluids. Symptoms include thirst but inability to drink much, hunger but no desire to eat, and a red, peeled tongue. Use formulas like [[Yu Nu Jian]].
- **With [[Phlegm-Fire Harassing the Stomach]]:** Adds symptoms of nausea, a stifling sensation in the chest, insomnia with vivid dreaming, and a greasy yellow tongue coat. Use a modified Wen Dan Tang.
- **With [[Liver Fire]]:** Characterized by significant irritability, a wiry pulse, and hypochondriac pain. Use a combination like Zuo Jin Wan.

## 🏥 Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Acute or Chronic Gastritis
- Peptic Ulcer Disease (especially duodenal ulcers)
- Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
- Halitosis, Gingivitis, Periodontitis
- Bulimia Nervosa
- Bipolar Disorder (manic phase), Schizophrenia (positive symptoms)

**Biomedical Understanding:**
Stomach Fire often correlates with hyperacidity, inflammation, and infection (e.g., H. pylori) in the upper GI tract. The burning pain corresponds to gastritis or ulceration. The upward-flaring symptoms (bleeding gums, bad breath) relate to systemic inflammation or local oral pathology. The connection to mania suggests a link between the enteric nervous system ("gut-brain axis") and central nervous system neurotransmitter dysregulation, where gut inflammation may trigger or exacerbate psychiatric conditions.

## 💡 Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- A red tongue with a thick, dry yellow coat is the most reliable sign.
- Differentiate hunger: Stomach Fire hunger is voracious and constant; Stomach Yin Deficiency hunger is a gnawing feeling with no desire to eat.
- Always ask about diet and emotional stress, as these are the primary triggers.
- For severe mental symptoms (mania), combine points that clear Stomach Fire (ST-44, ST-45) with points that calm the Heart and Shen (HT-7, PC-8).

### Common Mistakes
- Confusing Stomach Fire with Stomach Yin Deficiency. Giving strong cold herbs in Yin Deficiency will worsen the condition. The tongue coat is the key differentiator.
- Ignoring the Liver. Often, Stomach Fire is secondary to Liver Fire. If the pulse is very wiry, the Liver must be treated simultaneously.
- Using Heat-clearing herbs for too long, which damages the Spleen and Stomach Yang Qi.

### Success Indicators
- Reduction in burning epigastric pain.
- Normalization of appetite and thirst.
- Tongue coating becomes thinner and less yellow.
- Pulse slows down and becomes less forceful.
- Improvement in mental-emotional state.
