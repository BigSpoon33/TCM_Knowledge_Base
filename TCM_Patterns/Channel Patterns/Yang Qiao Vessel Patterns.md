# `=this.name`

**Type:** `Extraordinary Vessel`
**Nature:** `Excess` | `Heat`
**Location:** `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`

## 📋 Overview

Yang Qiao Mai Excess is a pattern of the Extraordinary Vessels, specifically the Yang Motility Vessel. This vessel originates at the heel (BL-62), travels up the lateral side of the body, and ends at the inner canthus of the eye (BL-1) before continuing over the head. Its primary function is to govern motor activity, absorb excess Yang from the head, and control the opening and closing of the eyes, thus regulating wakefulness.

When the Yang Qiao Mai is in a state of Excess, Yang energy becomes hyperactive and rushes upwards. This leads to the classic symptoms of insomnia (inability to close the eyes and rest) and daytime epilepsy (sudden, uncontrolled Yang movement). The excess pathology also manifests as pain and tension along the vessel's pathway, causing redness and pain in the inner eye, back pain, and muscular tension on the lateral leg, resulting in the characteristic eversion of the foot (outward turning).

## 🏷️ Pattern Classification

**System:** `Extraordinary Vessel`
**Subtype:** `Yang Qiao Mai`

**Eight Principles Analysis:**
- Excess/Deficiency: `= this.pattern_data.excess_deficiency` (Manifests as Excess, but often has an underlying deficiency)
- Hot/Cold: `Heat` (Manifestation is typically Yang Excess/Heat)
- Interior/Exterior: `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`
- Yin/Yang: `Yang`

## 🌱 Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
- [[Liver Yang Rising]] or [[Liver Wind]] stirring upwards
- Severe emotional stress leading to hyperactive Yang
- External Wind invading the channels
- Underlying [[Kidney Yin Deficiency]] failing to anchor Yang

### Pathomechanisms
- The Yang Qiao Mai is responsible for wakefulness. When it is excess, it cannot 'turn off', leading to insomnia.
- Excess Yang Qi rushes violently upwards to the head, agitating the Shen and causing daytime epileptic seizures.
- Qi and Blood stagnate along the channel pathway, causing redness and pain at the inner canthus ([[BL-1]]) and pain and stiffness in the back and lateral leg.
- Tension along the lateral aspect of the leg, where the vessel travels, pulls the foot outwards, causing eversion.

**Development:**
This pattern often develops from a pre-existing Zang Fu imbalance. For example, chronic Liver Qi Stagnation may generate Heat, leading to Liver Yang Rising. This hyperactive Yang then "spills over" into the Yang Qiao Mai, causing the characteristic symptoms of this vessel's pathology.

**Progression:**
`= this.pattern_data.disease_progression`

**Common Transformations:**
- May damage Yin and Blood over time, leading to more complex mixed patterns.
- Can combine with Phlegm-Heat to create more severe forms of epilepsy.

## 🔄 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | Yang Qiao Mai Excess | Yin Qiao Mai Excess | Liver Yang Rising |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sleep | Insomnia | Hypersomnia (lethargy) | Disturbed sleep, dreamful |
| Seizures | Daytime | Night-time | Possible, with tremors |
| Foot | Eversion (outward) | Inversion (inward) | Normal |
| Key Sign | Eye pain (inner canthus) | Abdominal pain, uterine issues | Headache, irritability, tinnitus |
| Pulse | Wiry | Tight, Deep | Wiry, forceful |

**vs. [[Yin Qiao Mai Excess]]:**
- This is the direct counterpart. Yang Qiao is Excess Yang (insomnia, daytime seizures, foot eversion). Yin Qiao is Excess Yin (hypersomnia, night-time seizures, foot inversion). They are polar opposites.

**vs. [[Liver Yang Rising]]:**
- There is significant overlap as Liver Yang Rising is a common cause. However, Liver Yang Rising emphasizes symptoms like throbbing headache, tinnitus, irritability, and a flushed face. Yang Qiao Mai Excess is distinguished by the specific channel symptoms: pain at the inner canthus, back pain along the spine, and eversion of the foot.

### Acupuncture Points

**Primary Points:**
- [[BL-62 (Shen Mai)]]: Master (opening) point of the Yang Qiao Mai. The primary point to treat this pattern.
- [[SI-3 (Hou Xi)]]: Coupled point (opens the Du Mai), used in combination with BL-62 to balance Yang channels of the body.
- [[BL-1 (Jing Ming)]]: Local point at the termination of the channel, for eye symptoms.
- [[GB-20 (Feng Chi)]]: Expels internal and external Wind from the head and neck.

**Supporting Points:**
- [[BL-59 (Fu Yang)]]: Xi-Cleft point of the Yang Qiao Mai, for acute pain and spasm along the channel.
- [[GB-29 (Ju Liao)]]: Meeting point of the Yang Qiao Mai and Gallbladder channel on the hip.
- [[LV-3 (Tai Chong)]]: Subdues Liver Yang and pacifies internal Wind.

**Point Combinations:**
- [For Epilepsy/Insomnia]: BL-62 + SI-3 + HT-7 + GV-20
- [For Eye Pain]: BL-62 + BL-1 + LI-4 + LV-3
- [For Back/Leg Pain]: BL-62 + BL-59 + Ashi points

## ⚠️ Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**
- `= this.pattern_data.contraindications[0]`
- `= this.pattern_data.contraindications[1]`

**Cautions:**
- This is a pattern of excess manifestation, but the root is often deficiency (e.g., Kidney Yin). Treatment must eventually address the root to prevent recurrence.
- Acupuncture is generally more direct and effective than herbal medicine for pure channel pathologies like this.

---

## 🔄 Pattern Variations & Combinations

### Common Variations
- **With Liver Wind:** More pronounced spasms, convulsions, dizziness, and a very wiry pulse.
- **With Phlegm-Heat:** Manic behavior, clouded consciousness during seizures, sticky yellow tongue coat, slippery and rapid pulse.

### Common Combinations
- **With [[Liver Yang Rising]]:** The most common combination. Treat both by subduing Yang (LV-3, GB-20) and opening the vessel (BL-62).
- **With [[Kidney Yin Deficiency]]:** Add points and herbs to nourish Kidney Yin (KD-3, KD-6, Shu Di Huang, Shan Zhu Yu).

## 🏥 Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Epilepsy (especially Grand Mal seizures occurring in daytime)
- Insomnia
- Stroke Sequelae (leading to hemiplegia and motor dysfunction)
- Sciatica (pain radiating down the lateral leg)
- Trigeminal Neuralgia (related to eye pain at the inner canthus)

**Biomedical Understanding:**
This pattern describes a state of central nervous system hyperexcitability. The insomnia correlates with a dysregulated circadian rhythm or overactive sympathetic nervous system. Epilepsy corresponds to abnormal electrical discharges in the brain. The channel symptoms (eye pain, back pain, foot eversion) can be understood as neuropathic pain or muscular hypertonicity along specific nerve and muscle tracts that approximate the Yang Qiao Mai's pathway.

---

## 💡 Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- **BL-62 is the key.** Needle with a stimulating method to open the channel and release the excess.
- The combination of **insomnia + daytime seizures** is pathognomonic for Yang Qiao Mai pathology.
- Always check for eversion of the foot, it is a subtle but highly specific sign.
- This pattern can be thought of as the body's "daytime" mode being stuck in the "on" position.

### Common Mistakes
- Focusing only on calming the Shen for insomnia without opening the Yang Qiao Mai with BL-62.
- Mistaking the symptoms for a simple Liver Yang Rising pattern and ignoring the specific channel signs (eversion, inner canthus pain).
- Not investigating the underlying root cause (e.g., Yin Deficiency), leading to temporary relief but quick relapse.

## 📝 Study Notes & Memory Aids

### Key Learning Points
1. Yang Qiao Mai controls wakefulness; its excess leads to insomnia.
2. It absorbs excess Yang from the head; its pathology involves Yang rushing upwards (seizures, eye pain).
3. The pathway dictates the symptoms: BL-1 (eye pain), spine (back pain), lateral leg (eversion).
4. Treatment is primarily acupuncture focused on the master point, [[BL-62]].
5. Always differentiate from its opposite, Yin Qiao Mai Excess (hypersomnia, inversion).

### Memory Device/Mnemonic
**"The YANG sun is UP, my EYES are open"**
- **YANG:** Yang Qiao Mai
- **UP:** Yang rising up (seizures, insomnia)
- **EYES:**
    - **E**pilepsy (daytime)
    - **Y**ang pathology
    - **E**version of the foot
    - **S**hen Mai ([[BL-62]]) is the point! / **S**leeplessness

### Clinical Decision Points
**When you see:**
- Insomnia → Check the Qiao Vessels. Is it Yang Qiao (can't sleep) or Yin Qiao (sleeps too much)?
- Epilepsy → Ask if seizures are daytime (Yang Qiao) or night-time (Yin Qiao).
- Unilateral leg pain/spasm → Check for foot inversion (Yin Qiao) or eversion (Yang Qiao).
