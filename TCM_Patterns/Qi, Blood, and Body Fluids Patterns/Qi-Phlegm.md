# `=this.name`

**Type:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_type`
**Nature:** `= this.pattern_data.excess_deficiency` | `= this.pattern_data.hot_cold`
**Location:** `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`


## 🏷️ Pattern Classification

**System:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_type`
**Subtype:** `= this.pattern_data.pattern_subtype`

**Eight Principles Analysis:**
- Excess/Deficiency: `= this.pattern_data.excess_deficiency`
- Hot/Cold: `= this.pattern_data.hot_cold`
- Interior/Exterior: `= this.pattern_data.interior_exterior`
- Yin/Yang: `= this.pattern_data.yin_yang`


## 🔍 Clinical Manifestations

### Cardinal Symptoms (CAM)
**Essential Symptoms:**
- Non-substantial feeling of swelling in the throat (globus hystericus)
- Difficulty in swallowing (feeling of something stuck)
- A feeling of oppression of chest and diaphragm

### Complete Symptom Picture

**Chief Symptoms:**
- Sensation of a lump or swelling in the throat (globus sensation)
- Difficulty swallowing, particularly solids
- Chest tightness and discomfort

**Accompanying Symptoms:**
- Frequent sighing
- Irritability and frustration
- Fatigue and lethargy
- Poor appetite
- Abdominal distension
- Nausea
- Cough with expectoration of white, sticky phlegm (in some cases)

**Tongue:** `= this.pattern_data.tongue`

**Pulse:** `= this.pattern_data.pulse`


## 🔄 Differential Diagnosis

### Similar Patterns

| Feature | This Pattern | Similar Pattern 1 | Similar Pattern 2 |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Chief symptom | Globus sensation | Epigastric distention | Watery sputum |
| Tongue | Normal color, sticky coat | Swollen with teeth marks, white coat | Pale, swollen, white coat |
| Pulse | Wiry or slippery | Weak | Slippery, possibly weak |
| Key distinction | Sensation in throat | Primarily digestive | Respiratory focus |

**vs. [[Liver Qi Stagnation]]:**
- Key difference: Liver Qi Stagnation focuses on generalized Qi stagnation symptoms (hypochondriac pain, irritability) whereas Qi-Phlegm manifests specifically as a throat obstruction.

**vs. [[Phlegm-Damp]]:**
- Key difference: Phlegm-Damp has a more generalized presentation of Dampness (heaviness, fatigue, digestive issues) with phlegm affecting the entire body, while Qi-Phlegm is more localized to the throat and chest.


### Key Herbs

**Essential Herbs for This Pattern:**
- [[Ban Xia]] – Transforms Phlegm, dries Dampness, descends rebellious Qi (Dosage: 6-12g)
- [[Hou Po]] – Moves Qi, dries Dampness, resolves Phlegm, descends Qi (Dosage: 6-9g)
- [[Fu Ling]] – Strengthens the Spleen, transforms Dampness, calms the Shen (Dosage: 9-15g)

##  Contraindications & Cautions

**Treatment Contraindications:**
- Pregnancy (exercise caution with herbs that move Qi strongly)
- Severe Qi Deficiency (address the underlying deficiency before strongly moving Qi)
- Presence of Heat (modify treatment to clear Heat if present)

**Cautions:**
- Avoid using overly drying herbs if the patient is already dry.
- Address the emotional component of the pattern to prevent recurrence.

**When to Avoid:**
- If there is evidence of true swelling or inflammation in the throat, rule out other conditions before treating for Qi-Phlegm.


## 🏷️ Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Globus Pharyngeus
- Anxiety Disorders
- Depression
- Dysphagia
- Esophageal Spasm

**Biomedical Understanding:**
Globus Pharyngeus is a condition characterized by the sensation of a lump or foreign body in the throat when no such obstruction exists. The exact cause is unknown, but it is often associated with anxiety, stress, and muscle tension in the throat.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM pattern diagnosis helps to differentiate the underlying causes and individualize treatment for patients presenting with Globus Pharyngeus. While Western medicine may focus on symptom management, TCM addresses the root imbalances contributing to the condition, such as Qi stagnation, Phlegm accumulation, and emotional factors.


## ✅ Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Always rule out physical obstructions or pathology with Western medical examination.
- Inquire about the patient's emotional state and stressors.
- Palpate the throat and chest for any areas of tenderness or tension.

### Common Mistakes
- Overlooking the emotional component of the pattern.
- Using overly drying herbs in patients who are already dry.
- Neglecting to address underlying Spleen Qi Deficiency.

### Treatment Modifications
- **If Heat signs are present:** Add herbs to clear Heat, such as Huang Qin or Lian Qiao.
- **If Spleen Qi Deficiency is prominent:** Focus on tonifying the Spleen with herbs like Huang Qi and Bai Zhu.

### Success Indicators
- Reduction in the severity and frequency of the globus sensation.
- Improvement in the patient's emotional state.
- Tongue coat becoming thinner and less sticky.
