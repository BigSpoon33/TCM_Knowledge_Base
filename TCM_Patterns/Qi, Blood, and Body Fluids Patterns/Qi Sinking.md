## 📋 Overview

Qi Sinking, also known as Qi Deficiency with Lowered Qi, represents a condition where the body's Qi, especially that of the Spleen, is weakened and fails to perform its normal ascending function. This leads to a downward displacement of Qi, resulting in a feeling of heaviness and bearing down, and potentially organ prolapse. It is a relatively common pattern, especially in women after childbirth or in individuals with chronic illnesses and poor dietary habits.

This pattern is characterized by a fundamental deficiency of Qi, which manifests as fatigue, weakness, and a general lack of vitality. The sinking aspect refers to the downward movement of Qi, leading to prolapse of internal organs. This downward movement is particularly noticeable in the lower abdomen and pelvic region, causing a characteristic bearing-down sensation. Addressing Qi Sinking requires not only tonifying the deficient Qi but also specifically raising the sinking Qi to restore its normal ascending function and support the organs.

## 🌱 Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
- Chronic illness, which depletes the body's reserves of Qi.
- Overwork and excessive physical exertion, which exhausts the Spleen Qi.
- Poor diet, lacking in nutrients necessary for Qi production.
- Childbirth, which can weaken the Qi and blood, especially if there are complications.
- Aging, which naturally leads to a decline in Qi and organ function.
- Emotional stress, particularly worry and overthinking, which damages the Spleen.

### Pathomechanisms
- **Spleen Qi failing to ascend:** The Spleen is responsible for transforming and transporting nutrients, and its Qi is supposed to ascend, providing energy and support to the upper body and holding the organs in place. When the Spleen Qi is deficient, it cannot perform this function effectively, leading to a sinking of Qi.
- **Qi deficiency leading to lack of support for organs:** Qi provides the necessary force to hold the organs in their proper positions. If the Qi is deficient, it can no longer adequately support these organs, causing them to descend. This is especially true for organs in the lower abdomen, such as the uterus, bladder, and rectum.
- **Middle Jiao Qi failing to hold up:** The Middle Jiao, associated with the Spleen and Stomach, is the center of Qi transformation and transport. If the Qi in the Middle Jiao is weakened, it cannot hold up the organs, leading to their prolapse.
- **Qi deficiency leading to damp accumulation:** Spleen Qi deficiency often leads to the accumulation of dampness because the Spleen's ability to transform and transport fluids is impaired. This dampness can further weigh down the body and contribute to the feeling of heaviness and bearing down.

**Development:**
The pattern typically begins with a weakening of the Spleen Qi due to one or more of the etiological factors listed above. As the Spleen Qi weakens, its ability to ascend and hold the organs in place diminishes. This initial stage may manifest as mild fatigue, poor appetite, and loose stools. Over time, as the Qi deficiency becomes more pronounced, the sinking aspect becomes more apparent, leading to the characteristic symptoms of prolapse and bearing down.

**Progression:**
`Often progresses from Spleen Qi Deficiency, leading to a failure of the Qi to ascend and hold the organs in place.`

**Common Transformations:**
- Pattern may transform into: [[Spleen and Kidney Yang Deficiency]]
- May combine with: [[Blood Deficiency]]

## 🏷️ Western Medical Correlates

**Common Western Diagnoses:**
- Prolapsed organs
- Hypotension
- Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
- Postpartum depression

**Biomedical Understanding:**
Western medicine understands organ prolapse as a structural problem, often related to weakened pelvic floor muscles, connective tissue damage, or hormonal changes. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Postpartum depression are understood as complex conditions involving hormonal imbalances, immune system dysfunction, and psychological factors. Hypotension is typically viewed as a problem with blood volume, heart function, or autonomic nervous system regulation.

**Integration Notes:**
TCM pattern diagnosis of Qi Sinking offers a more nuanced understanding of the underlying energetic imbalances contributing to these Western medical conditions. TCM treatment focuses on restoring the body's inherent ability to maintain organ positioning and energy levels, often complementing Western medical interventions such as surgery or hormone replacement therapy.

## ✅ Classical Sources & Commentary

### Historical References
**First Appearance:**
- Source text: Pi Wei Lun (Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach)
- Reference: Chapter on Spleen and Stomach disorders

**Key Classical Quotes:**
> "The Spleen governs the ascending of clear Yang. If the Spleen Qi is deficient, the clear Yang will sink, leading to prolapse of organs." - Pi Wei Lun

### Traditional Understanding
Traditionally, Qi Sinking is understood as a failure of the Spleen's ability to transform and transport nutrients effectively, resulting in a deficiency of Qi that cannot ascend and support the organs. This deficiency allows the organs to descend, leading to prolapse. The traditional treatment approach focuses on strengthening the Spleen, tonifying Qi, and raising the sinking Qi.

### Modern Interpretation
Modern TCM practitioners often view Qi Sinking as a manifestation of chronic stress, poor lifestyle choices, and inadequate nutrition. They emphasize the importance of addressing the underlying root causes of the Qi deficiency, while also providing symptomatic relief for the prolapse and other related symptoms. Modern treatment strategies often combine herbal medicine, acupuncture, and lifestyle modifications.

---

## ✅ Clinical Pearls & Experience

### Clinical Tips
- Ask detailed questions about the patient's lifestyle, diet, and emotional state to identify the root causes of the Qi deficiency.
- Use abdominal palpation to assess the degree of organ prolapse and identify any areas of stagnation or tenderness.
- Pay attention to the patient's overall energy level and mental state, as these can provide valuable clues about the severity of the Qi deficiency.

### Common Mistakes
- Focusing solely on the symptoms of prolapse without addressing the underlying Qi deficiency.
- Using harsh draining herbs that further weaken the Qi.
- Neglecting lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and stress management techniques.

### Treatment Modifications
- **If Dampness is prominent:** Add herbs that dry Dampness, such as Cang Zhu or Hou Po.
- **If Blood Deficiency is also present:** Add herbs that tonify Blood, such as Dang Gui or Bai Shao.
- **If the patient is elderly or debilitated:** Use smaller doses of herbs and be more cautious with tonifying strategies.

### Success Indicators
- Improvement in energy levels and reduction in fatigue.
- Gradual lifting of the prolapsed organs.
- Improvement in digestive function.
- Improved mood and mental clarity.

3. The cardinal symptoms include a feeling of bearing down and prolapse of organs.

### Memory Device/Mnemonic
**"Sinking Qi Brings Down Below (Organs)"** - SQBDB (Sinking Qi = Brings Down Below)

### Common Exam Questions
- What are the cardinal symptoms of Qi Sinking?
- What is the primary treatment principle for Qi Sinking?
- How does Qi Sinking differ from Spleen Qi Deficiency?

### Clinical Decision Points
**When you see:**
- A patient complaining of a persistent feeling of bearing down in the lower abdomen – think Qi Sinking.
- Organ prolapse is confirmed on examination – confirms Qi Sinking.

**Pattern diagnosis flowchart:**
1. Assess for general Qi deficiency symptoms (fatigue, shortness of breath).
2. Inquire about a feeling of bearing down or a sensation of something falling out.
3. Examine for organ prolapse.
4. Evaluate tongue and pulse for supporting signs.
