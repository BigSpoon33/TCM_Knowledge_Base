## 1. Overview

**Question:**
What do you know about Overview?

**Key Concepts to Cover:**
---

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Can you explain the main concepts clearly?
- Can you provide clinical examples?
- Can you relate this to other concepts?

**Reference Content:**
In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), cataracts, known as *Nei Zhang* (内障), are viewed as an "inner obstruction" or "inner barrier" affecting the eye's clarity. This perspective differs significantly from the Western medical understanding of cataracts as primarily a lens protein issue. TCM considers the eye to be intricately connected to the internal organs (Zang-Fu) through meridian pathways, emphasizing a holistic approach to diagnosis and treatment. The development of cataracts is seen as a ...

## 2. Clinical Manifestations

**Question:**
What are the cardinal symptoms and diagnostic features of Clinical Manifestations?

**Key Concepts to Cover:**
**Cardinal Symptoms:**
*   **Blurred Vision (视物模糊):** The hallmark symptom, manifesting as a gradual or intermittent reduction in visual acuity. The blurring may initially be mild but progressively worsens over time.
*   **Glare (畏光):** Increased sensitivity to light, causing discomfort and visual impairment, especially in bright conditions. Patients may report seeing halos around lights.
*   **Gradual Onset:** The insidious nature of cataract development, with symptoms worsening slowly over months or years.
**Tongue Presentation:**

## 3. Etiology & Pathomechanisms

**Question:**
What causes Etiology & Pathomechanisms and how does it develop?

**Key Concepts to Cover:**
**Primary Causes (Etiology):**
*   **Liver and Kidney Yin Deficiency (肝肾阴虚):** This is a major contributing factor. The Liver "opens into the eyes" and governs vision, while the Kidney stores essence, which nourishes the eyes. Deficiency leads to inadequate nourishment, dryness, and eventual opacification of the lens.
*   **Contributing Factors:** Aging, chronic illness, overwork, excessive sexual activity (depletes Kidney essence), prolonged use of eyes.
*   **Spleen Qi Deficiency (脾气虚):** The Spleen is responsible for transforming and transporting nutrients. If deficient, it cannot adequately nourish the body, including the eyes, leading to weakness and impaired vision.
*   **Contributing Factors:** Poor diet, overthinking, chronic digestive issues, fatigue.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Can you explain the main concepts clearly?
- Can you provide clinical examples?
- Can you relate this to other concepts?

**Reference Content:**
In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the etiology of cataracts ("Nei Zhang") is viewed through the lens of systemic imbalances affecting the eyes. While the condition manifests in the eye, the root causes are often attributed to disharmonies within the Zang-Fu organs, particularly the Liver and Kidney, and the disruption of Qi and Blood flow.

**Primary Causes (Etiology):**

*   **Liver and Kidney Yin Deficiency (肝肾阴虚):** This is a major contributing factor. The Liver "opens into the eyes" and...

## 4. Differential Diagnosis

**Question:**
How would you distinguish Differential Diagnosis from similar patterns?

**Key Concepts to Cover:**
**1. Other Types of *Nei Zhang* (Internal Eye Obstructions):**
*   **Glaucoma (Qing Feng Nei Zhang 青风内障):** This involves increased intraocular pressure, potentially damaging the optic nerve.
*   **Distinguishing Features:**  Acute glaucoma can present with sudden, severe eye pain, headache, nausea, and blurred vision, often with haloes around lights. Chronic glaucoma might have a more gradual onset with peripheral vision loss.  TCM patterns often involve Liver Yang Rising or Phlegm-Fire.  Checking intraocular pressure is critical in Western medicine diagnosis.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Can you explain the main concepts clearly?
- Can you provide clinical examples?
- Can you relate this to other concepts?

**Reference Content:**
When considering a diagnosis of *Nei Zhang* (internal obstruction) indicative of cataract through the lens of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), it is crucial to differentiate it from other eye conditions that may present with similar symptoms. The differential diagnosis involves considering conditions with visual disturbances and understanding the underlying TCM patterns that contribute to these presentations.

Here's a breakdown of conditions to consider and how to distinguish them from catar...
