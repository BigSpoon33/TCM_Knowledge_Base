## 4. Etiology & Pathomechanisms

**Question:**
What causes Etiology & Pathomechanisms and how does it develop?

**Key Concepts to Cover:**
**Primary Causes:**
*   **Dietary Irregularities and Malnutrition:** As the Spleen is the primary source of postnatal Qi and Blood, an irregular diet, insufficient intake of nutrients, or a diet lacking in blood-building foods (such as dark leafy greens, red meat, and beans) directly impairs Blood production. Overconsumption of cold, raw, or processed foods weakens Spleen Qi, further diminishing its ability to transform food into Blood.
*   **Chronic Illness:** Prolonged illness, especially those that consume Qi and Blood, gradually depletes the body's resources. Chronic digestive disorders that impair nutrient absorption, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, significantly impact Blood production.
*   **Excessive Blood Loss:** Traumatic injuries, heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), chronic internal bleeding (e.g., from ulcers or hemorrhoids), or childbirth can all lead to a direct loss of Blood, leaving the Heart undernourished.

- Can you explain the main concepts clearly?
