**Key Concepts to Cover:**
**1. Overview**
*   **Definition:** Yangming Headache, in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), is characterized by pain primarily localized in the forehead region. It stems from imbalances within the Yangming channels, specifically the Stomach (足陽明胃經 – Zú Yángmíng Wèi Jīng) and Large Intestine (手陽明大腸經 – Shǒu Yángmíng Dàcháng Jīng) channels.
*   **Key Characteristics and Diagnostic Features:**
*   **Location:** Predominantly forehead pain.
*   **Nature:** Often associated with signs of heat, such as thirst, aversion to heat, constipation, and a flushed face.

**Assessment Criteria:**

## 4. Etiology & Pathomechanisms

**Question:**
What causes Etiology & Pathomechanisms and how does it develop?

**Key Concepts to Cover:**
**Primary Causes:**
*   **Stomach Heat (胃熱):** Excessive consumption of greasy, spicy, or rich foods, coupled with emotional stress (which can affect the Spleen and Stomach's function), generates internal heat. This heat rises along the Stomach channel to the head, causing a headache. *Example:* A person with a diet heavy in fried foods and alcohol, experiencing chronic stress, may develop Stomach Heat leading to Yangming headache.
*   **Accumulation of Damp-Heat (濕熱):** Improper diet, environmental dampness, or impaired Spleen function can lead to the accumulation of Damp-Heat in the Stomach and Large Intestine. This obstructs the flow of Qi and Blood, causing upward disturbance and headache. *Example:* A person living in a humid climate who frequently consumes cold, raw foods may develop Damp-Heat.
*   **Yangming Channel Obstruction (陽明經絡阻滯):** Stagnation of Qi and Blood within the Yangming channels can occur due to factors like external pathogenic influences (e.g., Wind-Heat invasion), trauma, or emotional stagnation. This blockage prevents proper nourishment of the head, resulting in pain. *Example:* A person exposed to Wind-Heat early in an illness may develop a lingering Yangming headache even after other symptoms subside.
*   **Food Stagnation (食積):** Overeating or consuming indigestible foods can cause stagnation in the Stomach, generating heat and obstructing the flow of Qi. This upward disturbance leads to forehead pain. *Example:* A person who overeats during a holiday feast may experience Food Stagnation, manifesting as a Yangming headache.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Can you explain the main concepts clearly?
- Can you provide clinical examples?
- Can you relate this to other concepts?

**Reference Content:**
In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Yangming headache stems from imbalances within the Yangming channels, specifically the Stomach (足陽明胃經) and Large Intestine (手陽明大腸經). These channels govern the transformation, transportation, and excretion of food and fluids. Disruptions to these processes can lead to the upward flaring of pathogenic factors, manifesting as forehead pain.

**Primary Causes:**

*   **Stomach Heat (胃熱):** Excessive consumption of greasy, spicy, or rich foods, coupled with emot...

## 5. Differential Diagnosis

**Question:**
How would you distinguish Differential Diagnosis from similar patterns?

**Key Concepts to Cover:**
**1. Taiyang Headache:**
*   **Location:** Primarily in the occipital region (back of the head) and/or the neck.
*   **Channel Association:** Bladder (足太陽膀胱經 – Zú Tàiyáng Pángguāng Jīng) and Small Intestine (手太陽小腸經 – Shǒu Tàiyáng Xiǎocháng Jīng) channels.
*   **Distinguishing Features:** Unlike Yangming Headache, Taiyang Headache is *not* typically associated with heat signs like thirst, constipation, or red face. It's often related to external Wind-Cold or internal Kidney deficiency.
*   **Clinical Example:** A headache that starts in the back of the neck and radiates up the head, often triggered by exposure to cold weather.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Can you explain the main concepts clearly?
- Can you provide clinical examples?
- Can you relate this to other concepts?

**Reference Content:**
In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), accurately differentiating Yangming Headache from other headache patterns is crucial for effective treatment.
