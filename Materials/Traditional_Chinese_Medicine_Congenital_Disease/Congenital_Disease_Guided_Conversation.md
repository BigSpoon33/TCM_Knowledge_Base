## 3. Etiology & Pathomechanisms

**Question:**
What causes Etiology & Pathomechanisms and how does it develop?

**Key Concepts to Cover:**
**Etiology & Pathomechanisms**

*   *Genetic Predisposition:* While TCM doesn't directly address genes, it acknowledges inherited constitutions and tendencies towards certain imbalances which can then manifest as congenital conditions.
