*   **Key Influences:**
    *   Mother's health (Qi, Blood, Yin, Yang) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Mother's emotions (Liver Qi stagnation) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Environmental factors (toxins, diet) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Paternal *Jing* quality <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: [Define and explain the etiology. Use concise bullet points. Emphasize key terms.]

    *   **Consequence:** Damage to fetus, congenital conditions. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Paternal Influence:** Weak *Jing* quality.
    *   **Consequence:** Congenital deficiencies. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: [Environmental and paternal influences. Simple and to-the-point.]

## Clinical Manifestations: Overview

*   Focus on patterns of disharmony, not just anatomical defects.
*   Common Presentations:
    *   Developmental delays (motor, speech) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Frequent illnesses <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Failure to thrive <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Weak constitution <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: [Transition to clinical manifestations. Emphasize pattern diagnosis.]

## Developmental Delays: Motor Skills

*   **Kidney *Jing* Deficiency:**
    *   Weak limbs, slow development, delayed teething, poor bone growth.
    *   *Tongue:* Pale, thin, tooth-marked <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   *Pulse:* Weak, deep (Kidney position) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Spleen *Qi* Deficiency:**
    *   Poor muscle tone, fatigue, weak digestion, delayed growth.
    *   *Tongue:* Pale, swollen, white coating <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   *Pulse:* Weak (Spleen position) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: [Specific developmental delay example. Tongue and pulse indications.]

## Developmental Delays: Speech

*   **Heart *Qi* Deficiency:**
    *   Slow/hesitant speech, shyness, poor memory.
    *   *Tongue:* Pale, midline crack? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   *Pulse:* Weak (Heart position) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: [Specific developmental delay example. Tongue and pulse indications.]

## Treatment Principles

*   **Strengthen the constitution:** Tonify *Qi*, Blood, *Yin*, or *Yang* as needed.
*   **Address underlying imbalances:** Resolve Liver *Qi* stagnation, clear dampness, etc.
