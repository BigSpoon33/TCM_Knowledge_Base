## Four Main TCM Patterns

1.  **Damp-Heat Dysentery (湿热痢)** - *Most Common*
2.  **Toxic Heat Dysentery (疫毒痢)** - *Severe, Acute*
3.  **Cold-Damp Dysentery (寒湿痢)**
4.  **Deficiency-Cold Dysentery (虚寒痢)** - *Chronic, Recurring*

Note: [Introduce the four key patterns of dysentery. Highlight the relative frequency and severity of each.]

## Clinical Manifestations: Damp-Heat

*   **Stool:** Frequent, urgent, bloody/mucusy, burning sensation, offensive odor

*   **Systemic:** Possible fever, thirst, irritability, yellow tongue coating, rapid pulse
*   **Etiology:** Contaminated food/water, damp-heat environment, emotional stress
*   **TCM Diagnosis:** Damp-Heat invading Large Intestine, Liver Qi stagnation -> Heat

Note: [Focus on the most common pattern. Clearly outline the key clinical signs and symptoms.]
