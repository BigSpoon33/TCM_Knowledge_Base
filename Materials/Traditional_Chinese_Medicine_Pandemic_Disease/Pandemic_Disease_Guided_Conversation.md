## 4. Etiology & Pathomechanisms

**Question:**
What causes Etiology & Pathomechanisms and how does it develop?

**Key Concepts to Cover:**
**Etiology & Pathomechanisms**
**1. Primary Causes (Etiology):**
*   ***Li Qi* (戾气):** Wu Youke's groundbreaking concept of *Li Qi* refers to a unique, highly virulent pathogenic factor distinct from the six exogenous evils (wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, fire). *Li Qi* is believed to possess strong infectivity and the ability to cause widespread disease. The precise nature of *Li Qi* remained somewhat mysterious in classical texts, but it can be conceptualized as analogous to modern understanding of viruses, bacteria, or other highly contagious pathogens.
*   **Six Exogenous Evils (六淫):** While *Li Qi* is the primary driver of pandemics, the six exogenous evils can contribute to disease development, particularly when the body's *Wei Qi* (defensive qi) is weak. Heat and dampness are frequently implicated in *Wen Bing* due to their association with rapid disease progression and systemic involvement. Seasonal factors also play a critical role, as imbalances in the environment can weaken *Zheng Qi*.
*   **Internal Factors (内因):** The body's internal state is crucial in determining susceptibility to pandemic diseases. Key internal factors include:
