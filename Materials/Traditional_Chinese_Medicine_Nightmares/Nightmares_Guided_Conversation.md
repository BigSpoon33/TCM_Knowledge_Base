## 3. Etiology & Pathomechanisms

**Question:**
What causes Etiology & Pathomechanisms and how does it develop?

**Primary Causes:**

*   **Dietary Irregularities:** Poor diet, including excessive consumption of greasy, rich foods, can lead to Dampness accumulating in the Spleen, which can then transform into Phlegm, obstructing the orifices of the Heart and disturbing the *Shen*. Irregular eating habits can also weaken the Spleen's ability to transform and transport nutrients, leading to Blood deficiency and *Shen* instability.
