## 3. Etiology & Pathomechanisms

**Question:**
What causes Etiology & Pathomechanisms and how does it develop?

**Key Concepts to Cover:**
**Primary Etiological Factors:**
*   **Liver Qi Stagnation:** Emotional stress, frustration, and repressed anger impair the Liver's function of ensuring the smooth flow of Qi. This stagnation can lead to Qi rising upwards, manifesting as a vertex headache.
*   **Liver Blood Deficiency:** Insufficient Liver Blood fails to nourish the head, resulting in a dull, aching headache, often accompanied by dizziness, blurred vision, and fatigue. Blood deficiency can arise from chronic illness, poor diet, or excessive blood loss (e.g., heavy menstruation).
*   **Liver Yang Rising:** Prolonged Liver Qi Stagnation can transform into Heat, leading to Liver Yang rising upwards. This manifests as a throbbing headache at the vertex, often accompanied by irritability, red face, and a wiry pulse. This may be due to Kidney Yin Deficiency failing to anchor Liver Yang.
*   **Blood Stasis:** Impaired Qi and Blood circulation, often resulting from trauma, prolonged stagnation, or underlying Blood Deficiency, can lead to localized Blood Stasis in the head. This manifests as a stabbing or fixed pain, often worse at night.

- Can you explain the main concepts clearly?
