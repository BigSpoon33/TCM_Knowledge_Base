## TCM Patterns of Syncope

Note: In TCM, syncope is often associated with distinct patterns of imbalance, which we'll examine in detail.

## Dampness Obstructing Middle Jiao

*   **Symptoms:** Dizziness, heavy-headedness, nausea <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Tongue:** Swollen, sticky white coating <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Pulse:** Slippery, soggy <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Clinical Example:** Syncope after fatty meal <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: This pattern arises from impaired Spleen function and accumulation of dampness, often aggravated by diet and lifestyle.

## Phlegm-Heat Disturbance

*   **Symptoms:** Sudden loss of consciousness, possible convulsions, fever <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Tongue:** Red with a sticky yellow coating <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Pulse:** Slippery, rapid <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Clinical Example:** Syncope with high fever & delirium in a patient with history of smoking & alcohol use. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: This pattern reflects an excess condition, where heat and phlegm obstruct the orifices of the Heart and disturb the Shen.

## Liver Yang Rising

*   **Symptoms:** Headache, dizziness, tinnitus, irritability <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Tongue:** Red, especially on the sides <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Pulse:** Wiry, rapid <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Clinical Example:** Syncope during a heated argument in a hypertensive patient. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: This pattern indicates an imbalance where the Liver's Yang energy ascends excessively, often due to underlying Yin deficiency.

## Qi Stagnation

*   **Symptoms:** Distending pain, irritability, fluctuating emotions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Tongue:** Normal or slightly dark <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Pulse:** Wiry <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Clinical Example:** Syncope followed by chest tightness related to stress. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: Qi Stagnation is characterized by blocked energy flow, often triggered by emotional stress or constraint.

## True vs. False *Jue*

| Feature        | True *Jue* (真厥) | False *Jue* (假厥) |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **Nature**     | Yang Qi Collapse   | Underlying Heat   |
| **Limbs**      | Cold              | Warm               |
| **Prognosis**  | More Serious     | Less Serious      |

Note: Differentiating true and false *Jue* is vital for accurate diagnosis and prognosis. True *Jue* represents a severe deficiency, while False *Jue* often masks an underlying excess.
