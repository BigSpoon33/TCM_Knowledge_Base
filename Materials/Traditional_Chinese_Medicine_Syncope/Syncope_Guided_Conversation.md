## 1. Overview

**Question:**
What do you know about Overview?

**Key Concepts to Cover:**
*Jue Zheng* isn't merely a symptom; it represents a critical disruption of the body's internal environment. It signals that the normal flow of Qi and Blood has been compromised, leading to a temporary disconnect between the brain and the rest of the body. This disharmony can arise from various factors, including deficiencies in Qi and Blood, imbalances in organ systems like the Heart, Spleen, Liver, and Kidneys, or the invasion of external pathogenic factors. The historical understanding of *Jue Zheng* is deeply rooted in classical TCM texts like the *Huangdi Neijing*, emphasizing the importance of Yin-Yang balance and the unobstructed flow of Qi and Blood. By identifying specific patterns of disharmony, TCM practitioners aim to restore balance and prevent future episodes of syncope.
