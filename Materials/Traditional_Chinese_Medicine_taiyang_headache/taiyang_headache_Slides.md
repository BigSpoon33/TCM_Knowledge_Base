## Etiology & Pathomechanisms (cont.)

In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Taiyang headache arises from various etiological factors that disrupt the normal flow of Qi and Blood within the Taiyang meridian, primarily located in the posterior head and neck region.

**Primary Causes:**

*   **External Wind:** Considered a leading cause. The Taiyang channel, being the outermost of the three Yang channels, is most vulnerable to external pathogenic factors like Wind.
*   **External Cold:** Often accompanies Wind, exacerbating the condition. Cold constricts the meridians and vessels, hindering the circulation of Qi and Blood.
*   **External Dampness:** Obstruction of the Taiyang channel by Dampness can also cause Taiyang headaches. Dampness is a heavy, stagnant pathogen that impairs the flow of Qi and Blood, leading to a dull, heavy sensation in the head. This is often associated with Spleen Deficiency, which compromises the body's ability to transform and transport fluids effectively.
*   **Blood Stasis:** Chronic Taiyang headaches can result from Blood Stasis in the Taiyang channel. This can arise from trauma, unresolved Wind-Cold invasions, or prolonged Qi stagnation, which impedes the smooth flow of Blood. Blood Stasis manifests as fixed, sharp pain and can be difficult to resolve without addressing the underlying stagnation.
*   **Internal Wind (Liver Yang Rising):** In some cases, Internal Wind, such as that generated by Liver Yang Rising, can contribute to Taiyang headaches. Liver Yang Rising often causes the upward disturbance of Wind, which can manifest as throbbing headaches, dizziness, irritability, and tinnitus.

## Treatment Principles 💊

*   **Expel Wind:** Release the exterior.
*   **Disperse Cold:** Warm the meridians.
*   **Resolve Dampness:** Strengthen Spleen.
*   **Invigorate Blood:** Move Stasis.
*   **Subdue Liver Yang:** Balance Liver.
Note: [Outline the general treatment principles based on the underlying pattern.]
