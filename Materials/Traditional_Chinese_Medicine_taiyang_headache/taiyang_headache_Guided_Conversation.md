## 1. Taiyang Headache in Traditional Chinese Medicine

**Question:**
Based on your understanding of Taiyang headache in TCM, explain how the location and characteristics of the headache relate to the underlying TCM principles and how you would differentiate it from other types of headaches based on TCM diagnosis.

**Key Concepts to Cover:**
**1. Definition and Characteristics:**
*   **Location:** Primarily felt at the back of the head (occiput) and the nape of the neck. The pain can radiate to the upper back or shoulders.
*   **Sensation:** Patients may describe the pain as throbbing, sharp, dull, stiff, or tight. The specific sensation often depends on the underlying pattern of disharmony.
*   **Association:** Frequently accompanied by stiffness or tightness in the neck and shoulder muscles. Aversion to wind or cold can also be present, especially in acute cases.
*   **Significance:** The Taiyang channel is considered the outermost defensive layer of the body. A Taiyang headache often indicates that external pathogenic factors (like Wind or Cold) are attacking this channel. If left untreated, these factors can penetrate deeper into the body. It also suggests potential imbalances in the flow of Qi and Blood.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Can you explain the main concepts clearly?
- Can you provide clinical examples?
- Can you relate this to other concepts?

**Reference Content:**
In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a Taiyang headache specifically refers to a headache located in the posterior head and neck region. This area corresponds to the pathway of the Taiyang meridian, making its involvement central to the TCM understanding of this type of headache.

## 4. Etiology & Pathomechanisms

**Question:**
What causes Etiology & Pathomechanisms and how does it develop?

**Key Concepts to Cover:**
**Primary Causes:**
*   **External Wind:** Considered a leading cause. The Taiyang channel, being the outermost of the three Yang channels, is most vulnerable to external pathogenic factors like Wind.
