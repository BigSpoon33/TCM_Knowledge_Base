# **BL-1** · JĪNGMÍNG (睛明) · *Bright Eyes*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Jīngmíng BL-1 (Bright Eyes) is the meeting point of all the yang channels (except the Large Intestine) and the Governing, Yang Motility and Yin Motility vessels. Although the pathology of eye diseases is complex and varied, they may be summarised as due to i. exterior pathogenic factors (mostly wind and heat), or ii. to deficiency or excess patterns of interior disharmony. Yang governs the exterior, and due both to its location and the fact that most of the yang channels meet at this point, Jīngmíng BL-1 is the primary local point for the treatment of virtually any eye disease of exterior origin. It was traditionally indicated for redness, swelling, pain, lacrimation, itching and blurred vision. Equally, Jīngmíng BL-1 is an essential local point for the treatment of eye diseases due to interior disharmony, whatever the pathology, and was traditionally indicated for night blindness, photophobia, blurred vision, visual dizziness etc., and in modern times for glaucoma, optic nerve atrophy, pterygium, astigmatism, optic neuritis, retinal haemorrhage and early cataract.

Summary of clinical application
Important local point for many different eye disorders including redness, swelling and pain of the eyes, lacrimation on exposure to wind, blurred vision, dimness of vision, night blindness, photophobia, colour blindness, near sightedness, glaucoma, optic nerve atrophy, pterygium, astigmatism, optic neuritis, retinal haemorrhage, early cataract.

# **BL-10** · TIĀNZHÙ (天柱) · *Celestial Pillar*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Tiānzhù BL-10 is one of five points referred to in Chapter 21 of the Spiritual Pivot as points of the 'Window of Heaven' (see Point Categories for a fuller discussion), and in this passage it is said "Sudden contraction, epilepsy and dizziness, with inability of the legs to support the body, select Tiānzhù BL-10". Chapter 24 of the Spiritual Pivot says "inversion headache with neck pain followed by lumbar pain select Tiānzhù BL-10"

In common with the other Window of Heaven points, Tiānzhù BL-10 is indicated when inversion qi (chaotic and rebellious qi) rises to the head. This may give rise to dizziness, headache, heaviness of the head, stiff neck and epilepsy, as well as congestion, pain and swelling of the throat, eyes and nose, whilst at the same time in the lower part the legs are unable to support the body due to unbalanced distribution of qi.

The use of Tiānzhù BL-10 for disorders such as inability of the legs to support the body, pain of the body, and headache accompanied by lumbar pain is a reflection of the principle of selecting points above to treat disorders below.

Like Tiānfǔ LU-3 and Tiānchuāng SI-16 (also points of the Window of Heaven), Tiānzhù BL-10 is further indicated for mental disorders characterised by mania and incessant talking, as well as for disorders characterised in the classical texts as seeing or 'communicating with ghosts' and therefore attributed to some form of demonic possession. In terms of modern medicine these indications refer to various forms of severe mental disorder including schizophrenia.

Finally there is some similarity between the indications of Tiānzhù BL-10 and Fēngchí GB-20, both points being located close to each other. Fēngchí GB-20 however is much used clinically both to expel exterior pathogenic wind and to pacify interior wind, whilst the clinical use of Tiānzhù BL-10 is primarily confined to pacifying interior wind.

Summary of clinical application
Window of Heaven point for qi rebelling to the head: dizziness, headache, heavy head, stiff neck, pain and swelling of the throat, eyes and nose, inability of the legs to support the body.
For mania, incessant talking, ‘seeing ghosts’ and epilepsy.

# **BL-11** · DÀZHÙ (大杼) · *Great Shuttle*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Dàzhù BL-11 is the hui-meeting point of bones and is indicated for various bone diseases and rigidity and pain of the neck, spine and lumbar region. In modern clinical practice it is used when painful obstruction due to pathogenic wind, cold, damp or heat penetrates deeply into the bones and joints causing deformity (known as bony painful obstruction). Dàzhù BL-11 is also indicated for contraction of the sinews, and the Spiritual Pivot4 especially recommends Dàzhù BL-11 for treating contraction of the sinews that may accompany madness.

The Ming dynasty classic Investigation into Points Along the Channels says that Dàzhù BL-11 is indicated "for injury by wind which does not disperse, with bursting headache, soreness and pain of the back and scapula, interstices that are not closed, susceptibility to catching wind-cold". Taiyang channel is the most exterior of the six channels, and therefore most commonly the first to be injured by exterior pathogenic wind-cold. It is for this reason that exterior wind-cold pattern often gives rise to headache and pain of the neck which may extend down the upper back (taiyang channel). At the same time, exterior pathogenic wind-cold which first attacks the surface portion of the body easily penetrates to the Lung, since the Lung controls the skin and body hair. Dàzhù BL-11 is a point of taiyang channel and a meeting point of the taiyang Bladder channel with the taiyang Small Intestine channel. Furthermore it is located on the upper back, close to both the neck and the Lung. It therefore has a strong action both on the exterior portion of the body (demonstrated by its ability to expel wind-cold manifesting as stiffness and pain of the neck and scapula, fever, cold shivering and absence of sweating), as well as on the Lung (demonstrated by its ability to relieve coughing, dyspnoea and fullness of the chest). In this respect it is very similar to Fēngmén BL-12, especially in its ability both to expel excess pathogenic wind-cold and to firm the exterior in cases of deficiency (e.g. interstices and pores that do not close, susceptibility to catching wind-cold).

According to the Spiritual Pivot5 Dàzhù BL-11 is a point of the 'sea of blood'. This passage says "The Penetrating vessel is the sea of the twelve channels [i.e. the sea of blood]. In the upper it is conveyed to Dàzhù BL-11, and in the lower it emerges at both Shàngjùxū ST-37 and Xiàjùxū ST-39 ... When the sea of blood is in excess, there is a sensation as if the body were big; one feels disquiet, but does not know what disease there is; when the sea of blood is insufficient, one has the sensation of one's body being small; one feels reduced but does not know what could be the illness". Despite this passage it is worth noting that such indications are not found in later texts. Some commentators however interpret various indications of Dàzhù BL-11 as relating to disorder of the Penetrating vessel, especially the signs of qi rebellion in the chest (cough, fullness of the chest, dyspnoea) and head (dizziness). Finally, the Essential Questions6 includes Dàzhù BL-11 among the eight points (bilateral Quēpén ST-12, Dàzhù BL-11, Zhōngfǔ LU-1 and Fēngmén BL-12) to clear heat from the chest.

Summary of clinical application
Releases the exterior: fever, cold shivering, injury by cold without sweating, malaria, headache, throat painful obstruction.
For Lung and chest disorders: cough, fullness of the chest, dyspnoea, heat in the chest.
Hui-meeting point of bones: bone diseases, rigidity of the spine and neck, lumbar and scapular pain, spasm, contraction of the sinews associated with madness, stiffness and pain of the knee.

# **BL-2** · ZǍNZHÚ (攢竹) · *Gathered Bamboo*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Zǎnzhú BL-2 is an important and frequently used local point for the treatment of disorders of the eye and the surrounding region. It may be substituted for Jīngmíng BL-1 in a variety of eye disorders (primarily those due to attack by exterior pathogenic factors), especially by practitioners with insufficient clinical experience in needling points close to the eyeball. For this purpose it may be needled to join with Jīngmíng BL-1, or in the case of heat patterns pricked to bleed. Its effect on redness and itching of the eyes, combined with its ability to treat rhinitis and sneezing, renders it particularly suitable in the treatment of hay fever.

The sphere of action of Zǎnzhú BL-2 is not confined to the treatment of eye disorders however, and it is frequently used as a local point for frontal headache, pain of the eyebrow region, sinus pain and facial paralysis, and more widely (see combinations below) for one-sided or generalised head wind, and headache following alcohol intoxication. The Bladder divergent channel winds around the anus, and Zǎnzhú BL-2 is indicated for pain of haemorrhoids, an illustration of the principle of using points above to treat disorders below.

Summary of clinical application
Local point for eye disorders including blurred or dim vision, lacrimation on exposure to wind, night blindness, redness, swelling and pain of the eye, itching of the eyes, twitching of the eyelids, bursting sensation of the eye.
Local point for pain of the eyebrow and supraorbital region, rhinitis, sneezing, sinus pain and frontal headache.

# **BL-20** · PÍSHŪ (脾俞) · *Spleen Shu*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Píshū BL-20 is the back-shu point of the Spleen zang, where the qi of the Spleen emanates from the interior to the body surface, and like all the back-shu points (especially those of the zang) has a strong action on regulating and tonifying its corresponding zangfu at the deepest level.

According to the Complete Works of Jing-yue "Ming men is the sea of essence [and] blood, the Spleen is the sea of water and grain, together they are the root of the five zang and six fu". The principal function of the Spleen is to dominate the transportation and transformation of the products of food and drink. This vital activity, the basis of the post-natal qi of the body, requires continual yang activity and heat and pathologically therefore, the Spleen suffers mainly from deficiency of qi and yang. This tendency underlies all patterns of disharmony of the Spleen zang.

Spleen qi deficiency may result from constitutional deficiency, irregular diet, excessive thinking or overwork, insufficient or excessive exercise or prolonged illness. Deficiency of Spleen qi and impairment of the transportation and transformation function will give rise to such symptoms as lassitude, lack of appetite, diarrhoea with undigested food in the stools and childhood nutritional impairment, and Píshū BL-20 is an essential point in the treatment of such disorders.

Píshū BL-20 is specifically indicated for the symptom of remaining thin despite much eating. The Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach by Li Dong-yuan30 offers an interesting discussion on the various possible relationships between appetite and obesity or leanness, saying i. that if the Spleen and Stomach are both excess, food intake is large and a person easily becomes fat; ii. if both are deficient there is either inability to eat and a person is thin, or alternatively a person easily becomes fat (yet weak), despite a low food intake, this latter condition being due to accumulation of phlegm-dampness; iii "There are also cases of thinness despite large food intake. [In this case] fire hidden in the qi phase in the Stomach results in large food intake, while Spleen vacuity leads to withered flesh. This is known as food languor. Shu-he has said, 'Large food intake is not incompatible with weak muscles' ". The apparently contradictory condition of Spleen deficiency with a large appetite is often encountered in clinical practice and Li Dong-yuan's explanation of hidden Stomach fire with Spleen qi deficiency explains this well.

The important role that dampness plays in the pathology of the Spleen has been discussed in many classics. According to the Essential Questions "The Spleen loathes dampness"31, "Damp, swelling and fullness all pertain to the Spleen"32 and "When the Spleen is diseased, damp is generated"33, whilst the Case Histories from the Guide to Clinical Patterns by Ye Tian-shi of the Qing dynasty states "The Spleen likes dryness whilst the Stomach likes moisture". The origin of dampness may be interior or exterior. Interior deficiency of Spleen qi and impairment of the transportation and transformation function may give rise to incomplete separation of the clear and the turbid and the subsequent formation of interior dampness. This dampness may be carried to all parts of the body by virtue of the Spleen's function of distributing qi, but especially to the lower parts since 'the nature of dampness is heavy and turbid'. Alternatively, if exterior dampness or damp-heat attack the body, especially in cases of underlying Spleen deficiency, the function of the Spleen may quickly be compromised. Dampness gives rise to such symptoms as heaviness of the body, lassitude, somnolence, diarrhoea, dysenteric disorder, yin jaundice and oedema. Píshū BL-20 is an essential point both to tonify the Spleen qi and to resolve dampness, whether of internal or external origin.

Two further patterns that may develop from deficiency of Spleen qi are i. failure of the Spleen to hold the blood, and ii. sinking of Spleen qi. According to the Treatise on Disorders of Blood "When Spleen yang is deficient it is unable to gather the blood", whilst the Supplement to The Thousand Ducat Formulas states "The Spleen gathers the blood, when the Spleen is deficient it is unable to unite the blood". Part of the Spleen's function of controlling the blood is to hold the blood in the vessels. Weakness of this function will lead to haemorrhage in any part of the body, giving rise to such indications as blood in the urine or stools, menorrhagia, vomiting of blood and indeed any kind of chronic haemorrhage. When the Spleen's function of raising the qi is impaired, there may be sinking or prolapse of the uterus. Píshū BL-20, through its action of tonifying and hence raising the Spleen qi, is able to treat both these conditions.

An important further symptom of Spleen disharmony is stagnation in the middle jiao manifesting as abdominal fullness, distention and pain, or pain of the lateral costal region. There are three main causes of this disharmony: i. Spleen qi deficiency leads to impaired circulation of qi, and the treatment principle here is to both tonify and circulate the qi, ii. the formation and retention of dampness in the middle jiao may obstruct the circulation of qi, and the principle of treatment in this case is to resolve damp and circulate qi, iii. Liver-Spleen disharmony, due either to excess of the Liver which overacts on the Spleen, or deficiency of the Spleen which fails to counter the normal aggressive qi of the Liver. The aggressive Liver qi impairs the transportation and transformation function of the Spleen leading to stagnation. The treatment principle in this case is to harmonise the Liver and Spleen. In all these patterns Píshū BL-20 is a primary point.

One particular form of abdominal stagnation for which Píshū BL-20 is indicated is known as focal distention. This is characterised primarily by a sensation of severe blockage and distention, or the appearance of a swelling like an upturned bowl. It is one of what is known as the 'five accumulations' and pertains to the Spleen.

Since Píshū BL-20 tonifies the Spleen and regulates the middle jiao, it may also be used for treating the commonly encountered dual disharmony of the Stomach and Spleen with distention of both the epigastrium and abdomen, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhoea.

Finally the Illustrated Supplement to the Classic of Categories states that Píshū BL-20 is one of five points (Fèishū BL-13, Xīnshū BL-15, Gānshū BL-18, Píshū BL-20 and Shènshū BL-23) which "drain heat from the five zang".

Summary of clinical application
Major point to tonify the Spleen and resolve dampness and stagnant qi: lack of appetite, remains thin despite much eating, childhood nutritional impairment, undigested food (in the stools), diarrhoea, dysenteric disorder, oedema, somnolence, lassitude and heaviness of the body with no desire to move, distention and pain of the abdomen, abdominal masses.
Tonifies the Spleen to hold the blood in place and raise qi: blood in the stools or urine, vomiting blood, menorrhagia, chronic haemorrhage, uterine prolapse.

# **BL-22** · SĀNJIĀOSHU (三焦俞) · **
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Sanjiaoshu BL-22 is the back-shu point of the Sanjiao, where the qi of the Sanjiao emanates from the interior to the body surface. The Sanjiao integrates and harmonises the upper, middle and lower jiao and dominates the free flow of qi and fluids through these three areas. Located between Weishu BL-21 above and Shenshu BL-23 below, Sanjiaoshu BL-22 however has the action of regulating the qi of the middle and lower jiao only. It integrates the activities of the Stomach and Spleen in the middle jiao, and the Kidneys, Bladder and intestines in the lower jiao, and hence the transformation, transportation and excretion of both food and fluid.

The Classic of Difficulties35 states that “the Sanjiao is the pathway of water and grain”, the Essential Questions36 says “the Sanjiao is the official in charge of drainage and controls the water passages” and the Introduction to Medicine says “The middle jiao dominates transformation of the flavours of water and grain ... therefore it is said the middle jiao is like foam. The lower jiao dominates moving and draining the urine and faeces and at the right time discharging them ... therefore it is said the lower jiao is like a drain”.

In cases where there is loss of harmony between the Stomach and Spleen in the middle jiao and the intestines in the lower jiao, there are symptoms such as abdominal distention, borborygmus, diarrhoea or dysenteric disorder, undigested food (in the stool), difficult ingestion, oesophageal constriction and vomiting. In severe cases where there is obstruction and accumulation there may be abdominal masses or hypogastric lumps. Sanjiaoshu BL-22 is especially effective to activate and harmonise the qi of the middle and lower jiao, to resolve damp and to dispel stasis, and is one of the most important classically indicated points for such abdominal masses.

In cases where there is loss of harmony between the Spleen in the middle jiao and the Kidneys and Bladder in the lower jiao there may be oedema with difficult urination, blood in the urine and white turbidity due to deficiency and exhaustion. Sanjiaoshu BL-22 is able to treat such disorders by its ability to move the fluids and activate the qi transformation function of the Bladder.

Finally the Sanjiao channel belongs to shaoyang, and although not a point of the Sanjiao channel, Sanjiaoshu BL-22 is indicated for the treatment of alternating chills and fever, heat in the body, bitter taste in the mouth, headache and visual dizziness, all manifestations of shaoyang pattern.

# **BL-24** · QÌHǍISHŪ (氣海俞) · *Sea of Qi Shu*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Despite its evocative name 'Sea of Qi Shu', Qìhǎishū BL-24 is credited with no tonifying or qi regulating properties, and in clinical practice is mostly used (especially when tender) in the treatment of lumbar pain.

Summary of clinical application
Mostly used for lumbar pain and stiffness. Also atrophy disorder, painful obstruction, pain of the lower limb.
Also indicated for dysmenorrhoea, irregular menstruation, leucorrhoea, haemorrhoids, bleeding haemorrhoids, diarrhoea, diarrhoea containing blood, abdominal pain.

# **BL-27** · XIǍOCHÁNGSHŪ (小腸俞) · *Small Intestine Shu*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Xiǎochángshū BL-27 is the back-shu point of the Small Intestine fu, where the qi of the Small Intestine emanates from the interior to the body surface. According to Introduction to Medicine by Li Ting of the Ming dynasty "The Small Intestine separates the pure from the turbid; the water enters the upper opening of the Bladder and the dregs enter the upper opening of the Large Intestine". This quotation emphasises the role of the Small Intestine as an intermediary between the Stomach which 'rots and ripens' solid and liquid food, and the Large Intestine and Bladder which eliminate solid and liquid waste respectively. It is the Small Intestine which controls this process of separating the pure from the turbid. Although Xiao-Xiǎochángshū BL-27 is the back-shu point of the Small Intestine fu, therefore, its clinical action extends both to the Large Intestine and the Bladder.

In intestinal disorders it primarily drains turbid dampness and clears damp-heat and can be used in the treatment of diarrhoea, dysenteric disorder and blood and mucus in the stools due to this aetiology. Xiǎochángshū BL-27 may also be used for constipation, and for haemorrhoids and accompanying pain.

In disorders of the Bladder it also drains dampness and damp-heat and clears heat transmitted from the Heart (interiorly-exteriorly coupled with the Small Intestine), being indicated in the treatment of dark yellow urine, enuresis, retention of urine, blood in the urine and agitation of the Heart. Following the principle that dampness and damp-heat may be drained from the body via urination, Xiǎochángshū BL-27 is also indicated for damp-heat affecting other portions of the lower jiao with symptoms such as leucorrhoea and seminal emission. If damp-heat sinks to the lower limbs there may be swelling of the feet.

Finally, Xiǎochángshū BL-27 may be used in the treatment of the pattern of Small Intestine qi pain. This form of painful shan disorder which may arise due to improper diet, stagnation of Liver qi or exposure to cold, leads to obstruction in the circulation of qi in the Small Intestine. Its characteristic symptoms are lower abdominal pain or testicular pain that may radiate to the lumbar region.

# **BL-28** · PÁNGGUĀNGSHŪ (膀胱俞) · *Bladder Shu*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Pángguāngshū BL-28 is the back-shu point of the Bladder fu, where the qi of the Bladder emanates from the interior to the body surface. Its principal action is to drain damp-heat excess from the Bladder and genital system. Bladder damp-heat may be due to: i. invasion of exterior pathogenic factors (damp-heat or cold damp which transforms to heat), especially as a result of inadequate clothing or sitting on damp ground; ii. excessive consumption of foods that generate damp-heat (spicy, greasy, sweet, alcohol etc.); iii. Heart fire which transmits downwards via the Small Intestine to the Bladder; iv. Liver damp-heat which pours downwards to the Bladder; or v. excessive sexual activity or inadequate hygiene. Bladder damp-heat typically manifests as painful, difficult, hesitant and frequent urination with scanty dark flow. As the Bladder back-shu point, Pángguāngshū BL-28 has a direct action on the Bladder fu and is not only a vital point to drain Bladder damp-heat but is more widely used for any kind of urinary disorder.

The use of Pángguāngshū BL-28 is not confined to the Bladder however. It is an important treatment principle of Chinese medicine that damp-heat anywhere in the body, and most especially in the lower jiao, is best eliminated by draining via urination. Pángguāngshū BL-28, by its action of promoting urination, is therefore indicated for damp-heat affecting i. the intestinal region giving rise to diarr-hoea, and ii. the genital region giving rise to such symptoms as swelling and pain of the external genitals, genital ulceration and damp itching, swelling and pain of the vagina etc.

A second important action of Pángguāngshū BL-28 is in the treatment of a variety of disorders of the lumbar region, sacrum, buttocks, and coccyx as well as the lower limbs, and it may equally be used for excess or deficient disorders of these regions. It is classically indicated for the treatment of 'wind-taxation' lumbar pain (for a fuller discussion see Guānyuánshú BL-26), as well as for weakness of the leg and knee, seminal emission and diminished qi. These indications reflect the fact that as the back-shu point of the Bladder, Pángguāngshū BL-28 has some action of strengthening the Kidneys. As far as excess disorders of the lumbar region and legs are concerned, it is especially indicated for back pain, atrophy disorder and heaviness of the legs due to damp-heat.

Finally Pángguāngshū BL-28 is able to resolve stagnation in the lower abdomen (abdominal pain, difficult defecation, constipation, abdominal fullness) and to resolve abdominal (jia ju) masses in women as well as hard abdominal (ji ju) masses.

Summary of clinical application
Drains damp-heat from the Bladder and lower jiao: difficult urination, dark urination with unsmooth flow, retention of urine, enuresis, turbid painful urinary dysfunction, swelling and pain of the external genitals, genital ulceration, damp itching, diarrhoea, diarrhoea with abdominal pain.
Moves stagnation: difficult defecation, constipation, abdominal fullness, abdominal masses in women, hard abdominal masses.
Treats the lower back and legs: stiffness and pain of the lumbar spine, sacrum, buttock and coccyx, difficulty in bending, inability to sit for long, weakness of the leg and knee, cold and contraction of the lower leg, numbness of the leg, atrophy disorder and heaviness of the leg, sciatica.

# **BL-30** · BÁIHUÁNSHŪ (白環俞) · *White Ring Shu*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Baihuanshu BL-30 is primarily used as a local point to activate the circulation of qi and treat pain of the lumbar region and sacrum, pain of the lumbar region and hip, and especially pain of the coccyx.

In common with many points located on the sacrum (see Ciliao BL-32) Baihuanshu BL-30 is also able to regulate the function of the uterus and genito-urinary system. It is specifically indicated for stopping leakage in the form of seminal emission and nocturnal emission, leucorrhoea and white turbid urine.

Summary of clinical application
Mainly used for local pain of the lumbar spine, sacrum and coccyx.
Also regulates the lower jiao: irregular menstruation, dysmenorrhoea, leucorrhoea, seminal emission, difficult defecation and urination, prolapse of the rectum, dark urine.

# **BL-32** · CÌLIÁO (次髎) · *Second Crevice*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The points Shàngliáo BL-31, Cìliáo BL-32, Zhōngliáo BL-33 and Xiàliáo BL-34 are often considered as a group and are known as Baliao (Eight Crevices). In terms of their actions and indications they are very similar, sharing the common characteristics of regulating various disorders of the lower jiao, specifically: i. The urinary system. Cìliáo BL-32 and to a lesser extent Zhōngliáo BL-33 are the strongest in their action on the urinary system, being indicated for such disorders as painful urinary dysfunction, retention of urine, difficult urination, enuresis etc. ii. The intestines. All four points treat difficult defecation, whilst Xiàliáo BL-34 has the widest action on the intestines, being indicated in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion for "borborygmus and diarrhoea, internal injury by damp and cold, blood in the stool", iii. Gynaecological disorders such as dysmenorrhoea, infertility, irregular menstruation and leucorrhoea as well as disorders of the genitals for which Xiàliáo BL-34 is the strongest (swelling and pain, incessant green leucorrhoea with vaginal pain, pain of the testicles); iv. Invigorating the flow of qi and blood in the channels and collaterals of the local area and lower limbs, with Cìliáo BL-32 and Zhōngliáo BL-33 having the strongest action in their ability to treat disorders such as lumbar pain, sacral pain, atrophy disorder and painful obstruction of the lower limbs etc.

Zhōngliáo BL-33 is indicated for "the five taxations, the seven injuries and the six extremes", all forms of extreme exhaustion. This underlines a further aspect of the actions of the eight liao as a whole, which is to benefit, warm, firm and supplement the Kidneys, having amongst their indications impotence, infertility, seminal emission and incessant white leucorrhoea. All eight liao are specifically indicated for difficulty in urination and/or defecation. Kidney deficiency is an important underlying pattern for this disorder, which is frequently seen in elderly and weak patients. Sun Si-miao, for example, in the Thousand Ducat Formulas prescribed moxibustion at all eight liao for difficult urination and defecation.

In clinical practice, Cìliáo BL-32 is the most commonly used of the four points, having the most wide-ranging indications. It is frequently used in the treatment of dysmenorrhoea which radiates to the sacral area, as well as for back pain during labour. To relieve labour pain, needling Cìliáo BL-32 is often combined with electro-acupuncture. For this purpose the handle of the needle may be bent to 90 degrees and taped to the skin, allowing the woman to lie on her back.

Summary of clinical application
The most commonly used of the Baliao (Eight Crevices) points (i.e. Shangliao BL-31, Ciliao BL-32, Zhongliao BL-33 and Xialiao BL-34).
Regulates the lower jiao: urination (retention of urine, painful urinary dysfunction, dark urine, enuresis, difficulty in urination and defecation), defecation (constipation, borborygmus, watery diarrhoea), menstruation (dysmenorrhoea, irregular menstruation, infertility), leucorrhoea, painful childbirth etc.
Local point for pain of the sacrum and lower back: lumbar pain, sacral pain, numbness of the lumbar region extending down to the feet, cold sensation of the lumbar region, lumbar pain radiating to the genitals, sciatica, pain and painful obstruction of the lower limb, hemiplegia.

# **BL-36** · CHÉNGFÚ (承扶) · *Hold and Support*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Chéngfú BL-36 is much used for pain radiating down the Bladder channel from the lumbar region and buttock. It is especially indicated for pain of the buttocks and sciatic pain that is aggravated by sitting. Its secondary application is as an adjacent point in the treatment of haemorrhoids.

# **BL-39** · WĚIYÁNG (委陽) · *Outside of the Crook*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The Spiritual Pivot49 states "The he-sea points treat the internal fu". The three yang channels of the upper limb (Sanjiao, Large Intestine and Small Intestine) each have a he-sea point on their respective channel (Tiānjǐng SJ-10, Qūchí L.I.-11 and Xiǎohǎi SI-8). It is evident however, when one examines the indications for each of these points, that they have relatively little action on their related fu. This is not unexpected in view of the fact that whilst the channels are on the upper limb, in the case of the intestines, their associated fu are in the lower jiao. The same chapter of the Spiritual Pivot then goes on to rectify this contradiction by designating a lower he-sea point on the lower limb for each of the yang channels of the arm (Wěiyáng BL-39, Shàngjùxū ST-37 and Xiàjùxū ST-39 respectively).

Wěiyáng BL-39, as the lower he-sea point of the Sanjiao, has a specific action on the treatment of urinary disorders. The Spiritual Pivot50 emphasises the close relationship between the Sanjiao, the Kidneys and the Bladder, and states that there is a direct link between Wěiyáng BL-39 and the Bladder fu. According to the Essential Questions "The Sanjiao is the official in charge of drainage and controls the water passages"51, whilst the Ming dynasty classic Introduction to Medicine elaborated as follows "The lower jiao dominates moving and draining the urine and faeces, and at the right time discharging them ... therefore it is said the lower jiao is like a drain". The Spiritual Pivot says of Wěiyáng BL-39 "When excess there is retention of urine; when deficient there is enuresis; [when there is] enuresis, then reinforce, [when there is] retention then reduce"52 and "In diseases of the Sanjiao [there will be] fullness of the abdomen, hardness of the lower abdomen with inability to urinate causing extreme anguish, water will overflow and give rise to oedema and abdominal distention ... select Wěiyáng BL-39"53. As the lower he-sea point of the Sanjiao on the Bladder channel, Wěiyáng BL-39 specifically acts on the qi transforming action of the Bladder (ultimately controlled by the Kidneys) and hence is an important point in the treatment of retention of urine or difficult urination as well as enuresis.

An interesting classical indication for this point is axillary pain and swelling. This may be explained either by the pathway of the Bladder sinew channel, or more pertinently as a symptom of the Sanjiao channel.

Summary of clinical application
As the lower he-sea point of the Sanjiao is able to regulate urination: difficult urination, retention of urine, painful urinary dysfunction, enuresis.
“In diseases of the Sanjiao [there will be] fullness of the abdomen, hard ness of the lower abdomen with inability to urinate causing extreme anguish, water will overflow and give rise to oedema and abdominal distention ... select Weiyang BL‑39” (Spiritual Pivot).
Also indicated for stiffness and pain of the lumbar spine, lumbar pain radiating to the abdomen, contraction and pain of the leg and foot, distention and fullness of the lower abdomen, haemorrhoids, constipation.

# **BL-42** · PÒHÙ (魄戶) · *Door of the Corporeal Soul*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Pòhù BL-42 is located on the outer portion of the Bladder channel on the back at the level of Fèishū BL-13, the back-shu point of the Lung. The name of this point (Door of the Corporeal Soul) suggests that it is effective in treating disorders of the corporeal soul (po) and emotional disorders related to Lung disharmony. In fact, with the exception of 'three corpse possession disorder', the classical indications of this point predominantly reflect its use in nourishing and tonifying the Lung. 'Three corpse possession disorder' is a Daoist concept that refers to some form of 'possession' and is divided into 'upper corpse' which attacks the eyes, 'middle corpse' which attacks the five zang, and 'lower corpse' which attacks human life itself.

The predominant clinical picture expressed by the classical indications for this point is one of severe exhaustion of the Lung. It is indicated for Lung atrophy, Lung consumption, deficiency-taxation, taxation cough with heat in the body etc. In its ability to strengthen the Lung at the deepest level it is similar to Gāohuāngshū BL-43, although less renowned.

According to the Essential Questions60 the five outer Bladder points level with the five zang back-shu points (i.e. Pòhù BL-42, Shéntáng BL-44, Húnmén BL-47, Yìshè BL-49 and Zhìshì BL-52) drain heat from the five zang, an action shared by the back-shu points of the five zang.

Summary of clinical application
Classically indicated for severe exhaustion of the Lung: Lung atrophy (a chronic deficiency disorder where the lungs are said to wither and shrivel, in the same way that the limbs are seen to wither in atrophy syndrome), Lung consumption (a chronic disease characterised by progressive emaciation, cough with blood-streaked sputum, low grade tidal fever, night sweats, lethargy etc.), deficiency-taxation (a general term that is used to describe a variety disorders associated with injury to and depletion of qi, blood and the zangfu), taxation cough with heat in the body. Not commonly used in modern clinical practice).

# **BL-43** · GĀOHUĀNGSHŪ (膏肓俞) · *Vital Region Shu*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The name 'Gaohuang' can be translated as 'Vital Region'. This concept, implying one of the deepest and most funda-mental regions of the body, is first mentioned in Master Zuo-jiu's Tradition of the Spring and Autumn Annals (580 BCE), one of the earliest textual references to acupuncture. The Prince of Jin who was gravely ill sent for the famous Doctor Yi Huan. After examining the patient, Doctor Huan declared that the disease had settled in the gaohuang region (between the Heart and the diaphragm) and hence "it cannot be purged, it cannot be reached [by needling], herbs will not penetrate it, there is nothing to be done"61.

Gāohuāngshū BL-43 was comprehensively discussed in a text called Method of Moxibustion at Gaohuangshu by Zhuang Zhuo in 1128. Zhuang was inspired to write this book after being cured of various diseases, including malaria and beri-beri, by three hundred moxa cones burnt on Gāohuāngshū BL-43. He measured the location of Gāohuāngshū BL-43 on people of various body builds and gave diagrams and specific instructions for locating the point.

In discussing this point, Sun Si-miao in the Thousand Ducat Formulas simply states "Gāohuāngshū BL-43, there is no [disorder] that it cannot treat" and "once moxibustion is completed, it causes a person's yang qi to be healthy and full". Many classical texts say that Gāohuāngshū BL-43 is contraindicated to needling and emphasise its treatment by moxibustion, for example the Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man recommends the application of a hundred or even as many as three hundred moxa cones to Gāohuāngshū BL-43. Early texts, however, stress that after moxibustion at Gāohuāngshū BL-43, moxibustion should also be applied to points below the umbilicus, e.g. Qìhǎi REN-6 and Guānyuán REN-4, in order to conduct downwards the heat thus generated.

Careful examination of the classical indications of this point demonstrate its actions on the Lung, Heart, Kidneys, Spleen and Stomach. Like Fèishū BL-13 and Pòhù BL-42, it is able to treat severe deficiency (especially of the yin) of the Lung, and is indicated for consumption, cough, coughing of blood, steaming bone disorder, night sweating and emaciation. By both nourishing and calming the Heart it is applicable in the treatment of poor memory, pounding of the Heart, insomnia and phlegm-fire mania. Acting on the Kidneys, it is able to treat seminal emission, with or without dreams, and impotence. By strengthening the middle jiao it is able to treat feebleness and deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach, undigested food in the stool and weariness of the four limbs. So great was the tonifying action of Gāohuāngshū BL-43 considered to be, that it was said to strengthen the original qi and treat every kind of deficiency, the five types of taxation and the seven injuries. Finally, it is interesting to note that Gāohuāngshū BL-43 was also indicated for 'phlegm diseases' and Sun Si-miao in his Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas says it "stops phlegm in chronic disease". The importance of phlegm as a pathological factor in difficult and chronic diseases is long documented and is reflected in such sayings as "The hundred diseases all pertain to phlegm", "Strange diseases often involve phlegm" and "There is no place that phlegm cannot reach".

Summary of clinical application
Tonifies extreme deficiency of the Lung, Heart, Kidneys, Spleen and Stomach: Lung deficiency taxation, cough, asthma, coughing blood, night sweating, spontaneous sweating, steaming bone disorder, consumption, emaciation, poor memory, pounding of the Heart, insomnia, seminal emission, impotence, feebleness and deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach, undigested food (in the stool), weariness of the four limbs, vomiting blood.
“Gaohuangshu BL-43, there is no [disorder] that it cannot treat” (Thousand Ducat Formulas).

# **BL-44** · SHÉNTÁNG (神堂) · *Hall of the Spirit*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Despite the compelling name of this point (Hall of the Spirit) and the fact that Shéntáng BL-44 lies on the outer Bladder channel at the level of Xīnshū BL-15, the back-shu point of the Heart, there are no apparent references in any of the important classics of acupuncture to the use of this point for the treatment of emotional or psychological disorders.

According to the Essential Questions62 the five outer Bladder points level with the five zang back-shu points (i.e. Pòhù BL-42, Shéntáng BL-44, Húnmén BL-47, Yìshè BL-49 and Zhìshì BL-52) drain heat from the five zang, an action shared by the back-shu points of the five zang.

Summary of clinical application

# **BL-45** · YĪXǏ (譩譆) · *None*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Yīxǐ BL-45 is level with Dūshū BL-16 which is listed in some classical texts as the back-shu point of the Governing vessel. Whilst Dūshū BL-16 has few indications which reflect disorder of the Governing vessel, some of the indications of Yīxǐ BL-45, for example visual dizziness, eye pain, nosebleed, malaria, headache and chest pain radiating to the lumbar region, may be understood in this way.

Summary of clinical application
Rarely used.
Lies level with Dūshū BL-16 (listed in some classics as the backshu point of the Governing vessel) and has some Governing vessel indications: visual dizziness, eye pain, nosebleed, malaria, headache and chest pain radiating to the lumbar region.

# **BL-52** · ZHÌSHÌ (志室) · *Residence of the Will*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Zhìshì BL-52 is level with Shènshū BL-23, the back-shu point of the Kidneys. Despite its suggestive name 'Residence of the Will', there are no apparent references in any of the important classics of acupuncture to the use of this point for the treatment of emotional or psychological disorders.

Zhìshì BL-52 was also known as Jinggong (Palace of Essence), reflecting its ability to fortify the Kidney qi and yang, strengthen the sexual function and control discharge of semen, as evinced by its indications for impotence, premature ejaculation and seminal emission. It is similarly able to firm the Kidney qi and regulate urination, and is indicated for difficult or dribbling urination and oedema. Zhìshì BL-52 is also used clinically in the treatment of pain that spreads widely to the muscles of the lumbar region whether due to sprain, painful obstruction, or deficiency and disease of the Kidneys, for example renal colic. Unlike Shènshū BL-23, however, the application of Zhìshì BL-52 is confined to these patterns of Kidney deficiency and it lacks the wider ability of Shen-Shènshū BL-23 to deeply nourish and tonify the Kidneys.

According to the Essential Questions66 the five outer Bladder points level with the five zang back-shu points (i.e. Pòhù BL-42, Shéntáng BL-44, Húnmén BL-47, Yìshè BL-49 and Zhìshì BL-52) drain heat from the five zang, an action shared by the back-shu points of the five zang.

Summary of clinical application
Treats lumbar pain that spreads widely to the muscles of the lumbar region whether due to sprain, painful obstruction or deficiency and disease of the Kidneys, for example renal colic.
Strengthens the Kidneys: dribbling urination, difficult urination, oedema, impotence, premature ejaculation, seminal emission with dreams.

# **BL-56** · CHÉNGJĪN (承筋) · *Support the Sinews*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
As its name 'Support the Sinews' implies, Chéngjīn BL-56 is indicated for pain and contraction of the muscles and sinews, especially in the lumbar region and calf.

It is one of the attributes of the channels that as they travel distally towards the hand or foot, their points have an increasingly pronounced action on the whole length of the channel. Although not a major point, Chéngjīn BL-56 is characterised by its ability to treat disorders of the whole Bladder channel in the head (dizziness, headache, heat in the head, nosebleed, rhinitis), the lumbar region, the lower leg and calf, and the foot and heel.

Heel pain is often a difficult disorder to treat, and requires not only local points on the heel itself, but also proximal points. Chéngjīn BL-56 and Chéngshān BL-57 are the two principal proximal points that affect this region of the foot.

Finally, like several distal points of the Bladder channel, Chéngjīn BL-56 treats both swelling of the axilla and haemorrhoids. This may be explained by the pathways of the Bladder sinew channel to the axilla and the Bladder divergent channel which winds around the anus.

Summary of clinical application
For pain and contraction of the muscles and sinews, especially in the lumbar region and calf.
For disorders along the whole course of the Bladder channel, e.g. dizziness, headache, heat in the head, nosebleed, rhinitis, haemorrhoids, pain of the lumbar region, lower leg, calf, foot and heel.

# **BL-57** · CHÉNGSHĀN (承山) · *Support the Mountain*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Chéngshān BL-57 was included by Ma Dan-yang, the great physician of the Jin dynasty, among the 'eleven heavenly star points'67, his grouping of the most vital acupuncture points. Clinically, Chéngshān BL-57 is used in three principal situations: i. haemorrhoids, ii. contraction and pain of the calf, and iii. heel pain. The Bladder divergent channel winds around the anal region. Classically, Chéngshān BL-57 has been regarded as the primary distal point in the treatment of all kinds of haemorrhoids. For example, the Song to Keep Up Your Sleeve says "for the five types of haemorrhoids due to hot blood, select Chéngshān BL-57 and await disappearance of the disease without a trace", whilst Ma Dan-yang recommends it for " ... haemorrhoids and difficulty in defecation ... ".

Pain and contraction of the calf may be due to traumatic injury, painful obstruction, or the sequela of sudden turmoil disorder, but is most commonly encountered in the context of deficiency of Liver blood. The Essential Questions68 says "When a person sleeps the blood returns to the Liver". Pain and contraction of the calf therefore tends to occur at night when the body is at rest, the blood returns to the Liver, and the relative insufficiency of circulating blood is unable to nourish and soften the sinews and muscles of the extremities. This symptom is more commonly encountered in those who tend to suffer from blood deficiency, particularly women because of the loss of blood entailed in menstruation, and the elderly because of the inevitable decline of essence and blood inherent in ageing. Although having no action on the Liver blood itself, Chéngshān BL-57 is an important local point in the treatment of this disorder.

Heel pain may be due to traumatic injury, painful obstruction or Kidney deficiency. Chéngshān BL-57 is an important proximal point for this disorder and may be combined with other suitable points in the treatment of heel pain of whatever aetiology.

Finally, Ma Dan-yang and other classical sources emphasise the use of Chéngshān BL-57 in the treatment of lumbar pain. Clinically it is now more commonly used for sciatic pain radiating to the calf region.

# **BL-62** · SHĒNMÀI (申脈) · *Extending Vessel*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
In the Ode of the Obstructed River the use of Shēnmài BL-62 is referred to as one of 'the eight therapeutic methods'. In this description of the application of the eight confluent points of the extraordinary vessels to affect specific symptoms and areas of the body, Shēnmài BL-62 is indicated "to expel cold and heat and [to treat] one-sided and generalised head wind".

Shēnmài BL-62 is both a point of the taiyang Bladder channel and the confluent point of the Yang Motility vessel, reflected in its alternative name 'Yang Qiao' (Yang Motility). The taiyang (supreme yang) Bladder channel traverses the head and the entire length of the back, the most yang area of the body. It connects with the Governing vessel at points Táodào DU-13, Dàzhuī DU-14, Nǎohù DU-17 and Bǎihuì DU-20, where it enters the brain. The Yang Motility vessel traverses the lateral side of the body and head, connects with the Gall Bladder channel at Fēngchí GB-20 and enters the brain at Fēngfǔ DU-16. Furthermore, the Bladder divergent channel enters the Heart. This network of channel pathways helps to explain the principal actions and indications of this point.

Wind is a yang pathogenic factor characterised by sudden onset, rapid changes, constant or abnormal movement and a tendency to attack the head and upper and outer portions of the body. Wind may be of exterior or interior origin. Taiyang channel is the most exterior of the six channels and is generally the first channel to be attacked by exterior pathogenic wind. Shēnmài BL-62 is particularly indicated for the commonly-seen pattern of attack of exterior wind (usually in combination with either heat or cold) with chills and fever, aversion to wind, stiff neck and headache. Interior wind, by contrast, arises from interior disharmony, principally of the Liver. It rushes upwards, disturbing the brain and leading to such symptoms as lockjaw, opisthotonos, upward staring eyes, deviation of the mouth and eyes, windstroke and hemiplegia. The ability of Shēnmài BL-62 to pacify interior wind and treat such manifestations reflects the extreme yang nature of this point and its channel connections to the head and brain, rather than any action on the Liver zang. In other words Shēnmài BL-62 treats the manifestation of wind rather than the root.

Shēnmài BL-62 (the confluent point of the Yang Motility vessel) is classically indicated for day-time epilepsy, in contrast to Zhàohǎi KID-6 (the confluent point of the Yin Motility vessel) which is classically indicated for night-time epilepsy. Epilepsy principally involves three factors, namely stirring of wind, disturbance of the Heart and brain, and phlegm. The fact that the Bladder primary channel enters the brain and the Bladder divergent channel links with the Heart, combined with the ability of Shēnmài BL-62 to pacify wind, explains its special effect on epilepsy. Under its alternative name of Guilu (Ghost Path) Shēnmài BL-62 was included in a group known as the 'thirteen ghost points' listed by Sun Si-miao for the treatment of epilepsy and mania. Shēnmài BL-62 is further indicated for disorders of the Heart and spirit such as palpitations, insomnia and mania-depression.

The Spiritual Pivot states "When the taiyang [Bladder] channel enters the brain it is divided into the Yin Motility and the Yang Motility; it is here that the yin and yang meet; yang enters the yin and yin moves outwards to the yang, meeting at the inner corner of the eye. When the yang is abundant, the eyes are staring open; when the yin is abundant, the eyes will be closed shut"72 and "[When] defensive qi does not enter into the yin it will frequently remain at the yang. [When] it remains at the yang then yang qi will be full, [when] yang qi is full, the Yang Motility vessel [will become] abundant, [when] it does not enter the yin, then yin qi will become deficient and therefore the eyes will not close"73. These two quotations have served traditionally to further explain the ability of Shēnmài BL-62 to treat insomnia.

Shēnmài BL-62 shares with other distal points of the Bladder channel the ability to clear heat and excess from the head, whether due to exterior pathogens, excess fire, uprising of yang or stirring of wind. It is indicated for head wind and headache affecting both the midline (Bladder channel) and lateral (Yang Motility vessel) portions of the head, for dizziness, nosebleed, deafness and tinnitus, and especially for eye disorders, as both the Bladder channel and the Yang Motility vessel link with the inner canthus.

Shēnmài BL-62 may be needled for various other disorders affecting both the Bladder channel and the Yang Motility vessel, for example pain of both the lumbar region (Bladder channel) and hip (Yang Motility vessel).

Finally, Shēnmài BL-62 is indicated for swelling of the axilla and neck. These indications may be explained by the pathway of the Bladder sinew channel which ascends to the axilla and then emerges at the supraclavicular fossa to cross the neck.

Summary of clinical application
Expels exterior wind (chills and fever, aversion to wind, stiff neck and headache) and pacifies interior wind (lockjaw, opisthotonos, upward staring eyes, deviation of the mouth and eyes, windstroke and hemiplegia).
Clears heat and excess from the head: headache, dizziness, nosebleed, deafness, tinnitus, eye disorders.
Classically indicated for daytime epilepsy and insomnia.
Treats disorder of both the Bladder channel and the Yang Motility vessel (midline and lateral headache, pain of both the lumbar region and hip).
