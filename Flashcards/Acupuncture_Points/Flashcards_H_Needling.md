# **HE-2** · QĪNGLÍNG (青靈) · *Green Spirit*
## What is the needling technique and cautions for this point?
?
**Method:** Oblique distal or proximal insertion
**Depth:** 0.5 to 1 cun

**⚠️ Cautions:**
- avoiding the brachial artery
- many early classics only discuss moxibustion in relation to this point, implying that needling was contraindicated, perhaps because of the danger of damaging the brachial artery, whilst the Introduction to Medicine specifically contraindicates needling at this point.
