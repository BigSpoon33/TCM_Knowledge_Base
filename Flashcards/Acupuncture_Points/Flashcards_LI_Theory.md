# **L.I.-10** · SHǑUSĀNLǏ (手三里) · *Arm Three Miles*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Shǒusānlǐ L.I.-10 (Arm Three Miles), just distal to the elbow joint, mirrors the location of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 (Leg Three Miles) on the leg and shares its name. Although both points have the action of harmonising the Stomach and intestines, this is a secondary and relatively minor action of Shǒusānlǐ L.I.-10.

Yangming channels are "abundant in qi and blood"10, and in the same way that Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is a primary point to treat disorders of the lower limb, the main clinical application of Shǒusānlǐ L.I.-10 is to invigorate and regulate the circulation of qi and blood in the upper limb as a whole. It is much used in the treatment of both atrophy disorder and painful obstruction, as well as pain, immobility and numbness of the arm, in which case it is often combined with such points as Jiānyú L.I.-15 and Hégǔ L.I.-4 in the 'chain and lock' point combination method. Shǒusānlǐ L.I.-10 is often alternated with Qūchí L.I.-11 in the treatment of chronic and long-standing disorders of the channels such as hemiplegia and atrophy disorder, to avoid over-needling the same few points. Shǒusānlǐ L.I.-10 is also often clinically combined with Qūchí L.I.-11 as an adjacent point for diseases of the elbow, particularly tennis elbow.

As far as the treatment of toothache is concerned, Zhu Dan-xi of the Jin-Yuan dynasty recommended applying moxibustion to Shǒusānlǐ L.I.-10 for toothache of the upper jaw (and to Sānjiān L.I.-3 for toothache of the lower jaw)11.

Summary of clinical application
Important for arm disorders (yangming channel is abundant in qi and blood): pain and immobility of the arm and shoulder, hemiplegia, paralysis, numbness, atrophy disorder, contraction and inflexibility of the elbow, tennis elbow. Often alternated with Quchi L.I.-11 when frequent treatment is given in longterm hemiplegia, atrophy disorder etc.
Zhu Dan-xi recommended applying moxibustion for toothache of the upper jaw.
Indicated but rarely used clinically for such disorders as abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea, periodic sensation of cold in the intestines.

# **L.I.-12** · ZHǑULIÁO (肘髎) · *Elbow Crevice*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Zhǒuliáo L.I.-12 is primarily used as a local point for disorders of the elbow (for example in the treatment of tennis elbow when pain radiates upwards towards the shoulder).

# **L.I.-13** · SHǑUWǓLǏ (手五里) · *Arm Five Miles*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Summary of clinical application

# **L.I.-14** · BÌNÀO (臂臑) · *Upper Arm*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Although not a major point, Bìnào L.I.-14 is frequently employed for channel disorders in the upper arm, especially when pain radiates either downwards from the shoulder towards the elbow, or upwards from the elbow towards the shoulder. Like several points of the Large Intestine and Sanjiao channels located between the elbow and the shoulder, Bìnào L.I.-14 is also indicated for scrofula and goitre. Scrofula and goitre, although different in aetiology, always involve phlegm, combined either with stagnant qi or with heat. In the case of Bìnào L.I.-14, its ability to treat these disorders derives mainly from the course of the Large Intestine channel through the lateral side of the neck, rather than a special ability to transform phlegm, and the action of 'regulating qi and transforming phlegm' in this context therefore only applies to scrofula and goitre. The explanation of why several points of the upper arm have this special action whilst the more distal shu-points do not, is unclear (see also Tiānfǔ LU-3, Jiānyú L.I.-15, Shǒuwǔlǐ L.I.-13, Tiānjǐng SJ-10 and Nāohuì SJ-13). Finally, Bìnào L.I.-14 also shares with several points of the upper arm the ability to treat disorders of the eyes, in this case redness, swelling and heat. Summary of clinical application: For local disorders, especially pain of the upper arm which radiates between the elbow and shoulder. For scrofula and goitre, and redness, swelling and pain of the eyes.

# **L.I.-15** · JIĀNYÚ (肩髃) · *Shoulder Bone*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Jiānyú L.I.-15, a meeting point of the Large Intestine channel with the Yang Motility vessel, is also reached by the Lung and Bladder sinew channels, the Large Intestine divergent channel and the Small Intestine luo-connecting channel. Jiānyú L.I.-15 is considered the pre-eminent point for treating the shoulder, and clinically the majority of shoulder disorders affect this region.

Stiffness, pain, immobility or weakness of the shoulder or frozen shoulder may derive from: i. injury by exterior pathogenic wind, cold, damp or heat, i.e. painful obstruction, ii. stagnation of qi and blood from traumatic injury, misuse or overuse, or iii. deficiency of qi and blood from overuse, old age or prolonged obstruction of the channel. In all these cases Jiānyú L.I.-15 may be used, and in clinical practice is commonly combined with Jiānliáo SJ-14. As far as needling is concerned, there are two principal methods. For pain and immobility of the shoulder joint, the arm should be abducted as far as is comfortable and supported on a rolled pillow, whilst the needle is directed into the shoulder joint towards the centre of the axilla. For pain extending down the arm, however, Jiānyú L.I.-15 is usually needled with a transverse-oblique insertion towards the elbow joint.

The shoulder joint is the pivot of the arm. As Jiānyú L.I.-15 is the foremost point affecting the shoulder, lies on yangming channel which is "abundant in qi and blood", and is a meeting point with the Lung sinew and Small Intestine luo-connecting channels, it is a vital point to promote circulation of qi and blood in the upper limb as a whole, and is indicated for all kinds of atrophy disorder and painful obstruction and hemiplegia. For this purpose it is commonly combined in the 'chain and lock' method with points Qūchí L.I.-11 and Hégǔ L.I.-4.

Jiānyú L.I.-15 is also indicated in the treatment of urticaria due to attack of exterior wind-heat. This highlights the action of Jiānyú L.I.-15 in eliminating wind, which is emphasised in a variety of classical references to wind paralysis, windstroke, wind atrophy disorder and more generally simply 'wind disease'. Like Bìnào L.I.-14, Jiānyú L.I.-15 is also indicated for scrofula and goitre.

Finally, according to the Essential Questions16 Jiānyú L.I.-15 is one of the 'eight points for draining heat from the extremities' (although in fact only seven are listed) namely bilateral Yúnmén LU-2, bilateral Jiānyú L.I.-15, bilateral Wěizhōng BL-40 and Yāoshū DU-2.

Summary of clinical application
Primary point for all shoulder disorders: pain, weakness, winddamp painful obstruction, heat sensation, redness and swelling, inability to raise the arm to the head.
Important point for all disorders of the arm, especially hemiplegia, atrophy disorder and painful obstruction. Often combined with Quchi L.I.-11 and Hegu L.I.-4 in the ‘chain and lock’ point association method.
Eliminates wind in the form of urticaria, wind paralysis, windstroke, wind atrophy disorder etc.

# **L.I.-18** · FÚTÚ (扶突) · *Support the Prominence*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
In Chapter 21 of the Spiritual Pivot Fútú L.I.-18 is included in a list of five points known as 'Window of Heaven' (literally 'five regions of the Window of Heaven') points. This passage states "Sudden loss of voice with obstructed qi in the throat, choose Fútú L.I.-18 and bleed the root of the tongue". Fútú L.I.-18 shares certain important characteristics of this grouping in that it treats goitre and scrofula due to stagnation of qi and phlegm in the pivotal neck region, and sudden loss of voice, coughing and wheezing due to inversion qi. See 'Window of Heaven' for a fuller discussion of these points.

In clinical practice, Fútú L.I.-18 is frequently used as an alternative to (or in combination with) Rényíng ST-9, in the treatment of difficulty in swallowing (especially following windstroke) and chronic disorders of the vocal cords.

Summary of clinical application
Local point for disorders of the throat region: swelling and pain, sudden loss of voice, rattling sound, difficulty in swallowing.
Window of Heaven point hence treats the throat region (scrofula and goitre), sudden onset of symptoms (sudden loss of voice) and rebellion of qi manifesting as coughing and wheezing.

# **L.I.-20** · YÍNGXIĀNG (迎香) · *Welcome Fragrance*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
As its name 'Welcome Fragrance' implies, Yíngxiāng L.I.-20 is the foremost local point for treating all disorders of the nose. As such it is the primary local point for treating the Chinese disease categories of 'bi yuan', 'bi qiu', nasal polyps and sores. Bi yuan (literally 'nose pool' but translated in this text as nasal congestion and discharge) more or less corresponds to sinusitis and encompasses symptoms such as thin or thick nasal discharge and blocked and stuffy nose, commonly accompanied by pain and loss of sense of smell and taste. Bi qiu (translated in this text as rhinitis) also includes allergic rhinitis and encompasses such symptoms as sneezing, nasal discharge and itching.

Yangming channel governs the facial area, and Yíngxiāng L.I.-20, a meeting point of the Large Intestine and Stomach channels, is able to expel wind and heat from the face as a whole. It is particularly indicated for swelling and itching of the face, as well as for pain and swelling of the lip, heat and redness of the eyes and deviation of the mouth.

In recent years this point, needled to join with Sìbái ST-2, has been much used to control the pain of biliary ascariasis. This disorder, which is endemic in China, is passed by eating contaminated raw vegetables fertilised by human 'night soil'. If the worms, which grow in the gall bladder, pass into the biliary duct, there is severe pain which is similar to that of cholelithiasis. The first step in treatment is to needle from Yíngxiāng L.I.-20 through to Sìbái ST-2 with strong manipulation. This is usually effective to control the pain within one or two minutes. Additional points on the body are used to consolidate the effect, whilst herbal medicine is used subsequently to eliminate the worms.

Summary of clinical application
Principal local point for all nose disorders: congestion and discharge, nosebleed, loss of sense of smell, nasal polyps, nasal sores, rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, sneezing.
Local point for pain, swelling, itching and paralysis of the face.
Joined to Sìbái ST-2 for treating pain of biliary ascariasis (worms in the bile duct).

# **L.I.-4** · HÉGǓ (合谷) · *Joining Valley*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Hégǔ L.I.-4 was included by Ma Dan-yang, the great physician of the Jin dynasty, among the 'eleven heavenly star points'6, his grouping of the most vital acupuncture points, and was indicated by him for headache, swelling of the face, malaria with chills and fever, tooth decay, nosebleed and lockjaw with inability to speak. The Ming dynasty author Gao Wu in his work Glorious Anthology of Acupuncture and Moxibustion also recognised the supreme importance of this point and included it among his 'four command points' (for the face and mouth). Some hundreds of years later it is still probably the best known and most commonly used of the acupuncture points.

Hégǔ L.I.-4 is a primary point to expel wind-cold or wind-heat and to release the exterior. It may be useful in this respect to view the yang Large Intestine channel as the exterior reflection of the yin Lung channel with which it is coupled. The Lung dominates the exterior by virtue of its function of controlling the skin and body hair and spreading the defensive qi. Attack by exterior pathogenic wind-cold or wind-heat which disrupts the exterior portion of the Lung system therefore, may be treated via points of the Large Intestine channel, most notably by Hégǔ L.I.-4. Thus the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion recommends this point for "injury by cold, headache, rigid spine, and absence of sweating". This is the classic presentation of wind-cold binding the exterior portion of the body. The basic principle in Chinese medicine for the treatment of this condition is to release the exterior by inducing sweating, thereby expelling the pathogen along with the sweat and facilitating the circulation of defensive qi. In fact, Hégǔ L.I.-4 may also be used for injury by any exterior pathogenic factor which is accompanied by sweating (in this case pathological sweating which does not serve to expel the pathogenic factor). This dual action of Hégǔ L.I.-4 on both inducing and stopping sweating is reflected by the advice given in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion to reinforce Hégǔ L.I.-4 and reduce Fùliū KID-7 if there is no sweating, and to reduce Hégǔ L.I.-4 and reinforce Fùliū KID-7 in cases with copious sweating. The explanation of this apparently contradictory function is that Hégǔ L.I.-4 is able to regulate defensive qi and hence adjust the pores, whatever the pattern, indeed some authorities go so far as to attribute to Hégǔ L.I.-4 the ability to tonify the defensive qi.

The passage from the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion quoted above includes the symptom of 'great thirst', which is clearly not typical of exterior patterns (where the fever and thirst are still relatively mild). This does, however, reflect the common use of Hégǔ L.I.-4, especially in combination with Qūchí L.I.-11, to reduce high fever of whatever aetiology.

Hégǔ L.I.-4 is the single most important point to treat disorders of the face and sense organs. This has been emphasised in numerous classics, for example the Classic of the Jade Dragon states "Hégǔ L.I.-4 treats all diseases of the head, face, ears, eyes, nose, cheeks, mouth and teeth". This point is essential in the treatment of any disorder affecting these areas - whether acute or chronic, hot or cold, deficient or excess - but is least used clinically for disorders of the ears. As far as headaches are concerned, Hégǔ L.I.-4 is considered appropriate in the treatment of headache in any location due to attack by exterior pathogens, and most particularly any frontal (yangming channel) headache. In clinical practice, however, it is used even more widely, for example the Classic of the Jade Dragon recommended Hégǔ L.I.-4 for one-sided or generalised headache, whilst the Ode of the Jade Dragon more specifically recommended Hégǔ L.I.-4 for head wind without phlegm, and Fēngchí GB-20 for head wind with phlegm. The affinity of Hégǔ L.I.-4 for both the forehead and the side of the head reflects the fact that the internal pathway of the Large Intestine channel meets with the Gall Bladder channel at Yángbái GB-14, Xuánlú GB-5 and Xuánlí GB-6.

Hégǔ L.I.-4 is considered to have a particular ability to ease pain, especially in the areas discussed above, and is a commonly used point in acupuncture analgesia. According to Chinese medicine, pain of excess type arises when impaired circulation of qi and blood leads to stagnation. This is expressed in the saying "without movement there is pain, with movement there is no pain". The special ability of Hégǔ L.I.-4 to treat pain is explained by the statement in the Spiritual Pivot7 "Yangming channel is abundant in qi and blood". This emphasises the particular ability of points on the Large Intestine and Stomach (yangming) channels to promote circulation of qi and blood, and thus dispel obstruction and stop pain, for example in painful disorders such as painful obstruction. However the abundance of qi and blood in the arm and foot yangming channels means that their points are not only important to dispel stagnation, but also to tonify qi and blood in the channels and thus bring nourishment to the limbs in case of atrophy disorder and hemiplegia. In practice, Hégǔ L.I.-4 is commonly combined with Jiānyú L.I.-15 and Qūchí L.I.-11 in the 'chain and lock' point association method for pain, paralysis or atrophy of the upper limb.

Bilateral Hégǔ L.I.-4 and Tàichōng LIV-3 are known as the Four Gates. This combination first appeared in the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries which said "for cold and heat with painful obstruction, open the Four Gates". The text goes on to imply that the yuan-source points of the six yang channels emerge at the four gates. Since a fundamental principle for treating painful obstruction is to select points from yang channels, this helps to explain why these two points are considered so effective in treating painful obstruction. Subsequently, the use of the Four Gates has been extended to treat a variety of disorders involving pain and spasm. This is an elegant combination. Hégǔ L.I.-4 on the upper extremity lies in the wide valley between the first and second metacarpals, whilst Tàichōng LIV-3 on the lower extremity lies in the wide valley between the first and second metatarsals. Hégǔ L.I.-4, the yuan-source point, belongs to yangming channel which is 'abundant in qi and blood' whilst Tàichōng LIV-3, the shu-stream and yuan-source point of the Liver channel, has the function of spreading the qi. Together they are able to activate the qi and blood and ensure their free and smooth passage throughout the body.

Hégǔ L.I.-4 has a strong action on promoting labour. The Ode to Elucidate Mysteries tells how the Song dynasty Crown Prince, in a dispute with the doctor Xu Wen-bai over whether a pregnant woman was carrying a girl or twins, ordered her belly to be cut open to find out. Xu Wen-bai begged to use his needles instead, and on reducing Zúsānlǐ ST-36 and reinforcing Hégǔ L.I.-4 two babies emerged. Due to its strong action of inducing labour, and even promoting the expulsion of a dead foetus, Hégǔ L.I.-4 is contraindicated in pregnancy.

Finally Hégǔ L.I.-4 is cited in the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang, for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc.

?
See discussion of Xiàlián L.I.-8.

Summary of clinical application
Indicated for Large Intestine disorders although rarely used clinically: borborygmus, Large Intestine qi stagnation, abdominal pain.
Note that Shanglian L.I.-9 (Upper Angle) is a reflection on the upper limb of Shangjuxu ST-37 (Upper Great Void), the lower he-sea point of the Large Intestine, on the leg.
