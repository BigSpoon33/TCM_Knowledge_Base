# **ST-9** · RÉNYÍNG (人迎) · *Man's Welcome*
## What is the location and special properties of this point?

i. Ask the patient to lie flat and remove any pillow. Palpate the laryngeal prominence, and then, laterally, the lateral border of the thyroid cartilage. A little more laterally than this, the carotid artery may be felt. ii. In females the laryngeal prominence is not as pronounced as in males.
