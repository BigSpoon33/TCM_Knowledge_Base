# **DU-1** · CHÁNGQIÁNG (長強) · *Long Strong*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Chángqiáng DU-1 is the first point and the luo-connecting point of the Governing vessel, and all its indications reflect the pathways and functions of the Governing vessel principal and luo-connecting pathways.

The Governing vessel winds around the anus, and Chángqiáng DU-1 is an important local point in the treatment of haemorrhoids, prolapse of the rectum and disorders of defecation. The Governing vessel enters the Kidneys and its anterior pathway winds around the genitals. Chángqiáng DU-1 is therefore also indicated for various disorders of urination such as painful urinary dysfunction, difficult urination and retention of urine, as well as sexual taxation and the unusual symptom of seminal emission induced by fear and fright, emotions which are classically considered to injure the Kidneys and Heart.

The Governing vessel ascends along the entire length of the spinal column and enters the brain, whilst its luo-connecting channel spreads in the occiput. As well as lumbar and sacral pain and stiffness of the spine, Chángqiáng DU-1 is indicated for heaviness of the head. The Spiritual Pivot24 gives specific indications for disorders of the Governing luo-connecting channel. If it is excess there is stiffness of the spine, and if deficient there is heaviness of the head and shaking of the head.

Although the Heart is most frequently cited as the residence of the spirit, since its early beginnings Chinese medicine has been able to hold the concurrent belief that the head and brain also influence the spirit (see introductory discussion above). Thus the Essential Questions25 stated "the head is the residence of the intelligence" and Sun Si-miao, in the Thousand Ducat Formulas said "The head is the supreme leader, the place where man's spirit concentrates". Since the Governing vessel enters the brain and its anterior pathway ascends through the Heart, Chángqiáng DU-1 is indicated for such manifestations of disordered spirit as mania, mad walking and fright epilepsy, as well as for pain of the Heart.

According to qigong theory, there are three important gates or passes (sanguan) in the practice of qi circulation through the Governing vessel. These gates, through which it is more difficult to circulate the qi are the Coccyx Pass (Weiluguan) in the region of Chángqiáng DU-1, the Lumbar Pass (Jiajiguan) in the region of Mìngmén DU-4, and the Occipital Pass (Yuzhenwan) in the region of Yùzhěn BL-9. Chángqiáng DU-1 has been accorded a great variety of different names. Its best known, Changqiang (Long Strong), is said to refer either to the Governing vessel (of which this is the first point) which is long and strong, or to this point's ability to make the penis long and strong. Alternative names include Longhuxue (Dragon and Tiger Point), Chaotiandian (Heavenward-Looking Summit) and Shangtianti (Stairway to Heaven).

Summary of clinical application
Principal local point in the treatment of haemorrhoids, prolapse of the rectum and disorders of defecation.
Regulates the genito-urinary system: painful urinary dysfunction, difficult urination, retention of urine, sexual taxation, seminal emission.
Luo-connecting point of the Governing vessel: “If it is excess there is stiffness of the spine, and if deficient there is heaviness of the head and shaking of the head”.
Treats the Heart and spirit: pain of the Heart, mania, mad walking, fright epilepsy.

# **DU-10** · LÍNGTÁI (霊台) · *Spirit Tower*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The name Lingtai (Spirit Tower) is a traditional term for the Heart and has come to denote the reasoning faculty. It originated with the Spirit Tower built by the emperor Wen Wang as a vantage point to survey all that lay beneath him. Despite this name and the fact that Língtái DU-10 is located one vertebra below Xīnshū BL-15, the back-shu point of the Heart, there are no indications or combinations reflecting this association in any major classic.

Língtái DU-10 is an empirical point in the treatment of furuncle and red-thread furuncle (lymphangitis) as well as for clove sores (small, hard, deep-rooted, clove-shaped purulent lesions), and is used for this purpose in modern clinical practice. It is also indicated in the Essential Questions31 for heat in the Spleen. This indication clearly fell out of favour and was not mentioned in subsequent texts.

Summary of clinical application
Empirical point for furuncle, red-thread furuncle (lymphangitis) and clove sores (small, hard, deep-rooted, clove-shaped purulent lesions).

# **DU-12** · SHĒNZHÙ (身柱) · *Body Pillar*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
As early as the Essential Questions33 Shēnzhù DU-12 was said to clear heat from the chest, and this is reinforced by many indications found in subsequent classical texts. Shēnzhù DU-12, located below the third thoracic vertebra at the level of Fèishū BL-13 the back-shu point of the Lung, is able to clear heat from the Lung, giving rise to cough, dyspnoea and fever. According to the Warp and Woof of Warm Febrile Diseases "The Lung and Heart are mutually connected; when there is Lung heat it most easily enters the Heart". This passage helps explain why Shēnzhù DU-12 is also indicated for heat in the Heart which gives rise to such excess pattern manifestations of spirit disturbance as mad walking, ranting and raving, 'seeing ghosts' and rage with desire to kill. This ability to clear heat from the Lung and calm the spirit in excess patterns can be contrasted to the action of the previous point, Shéndào DU-11, which is primarily used for deficiency patterns of the Heart and Lung.

Like many other points of this channel, Shēnzhù DU-12 is also able to pacify wind in the Governing vessel and is indicated for epilepsy and clonic spasm.

Summary of clinical application
For heat in the Lung: cough, dyspnoea, fever.
For heat which disturbs the Heart and spirit: mad walking, ranting and raving, seeing ghosts, rage with desire to kill.

# **DU-13** · TÁODÀO (陶道) · *Way of Happiness*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The Governing vessel is the 'sea of the yang channels' and many of its points are effective to reduce yang heat in the body, including febrile diseases and most especially malaria. In both traditional and modern clinical practice Táodào DU-13 has been an important point in the treatment of malaria, whether acute or chronic. This is primarily due to its ability to clear heat from the Governing vessel, and this action is reflected also in the indications for chills and fever and steaming bone disorder.

Like many points of the Governing vessel, Táodào DU-13 is also able to regulate the channel and to clear wind and is indicated for stiffness of the spine, heaviness of the head and clonic spasm.

Finally, as its name 'Way of Happiness' suggests, Táodào DU-13 is indicated for unhappiness and disorientation.

Summary of clinical application
Important point in the treatment of malaria as well as other diseases involving chills and fever; also absence of sweating, steaming bone disorder.

# **DU-14** · DÀZHUĪ (大椎) · *Great Vertebra*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The Governing vessel is known as the 'sea of the yang channels' and Dàzhuī DU-14 is the meeting point of the Governing vessel with the six yang channels of the hand and foot. As a consequence, Dàzhuī DU-14 has a strong action on i. clearing pathogenic factors from and firming the exterior yang portion of the body, ii. clearing yang heat, and iii. tonifying qi and yang.

When exterior pathogenic factors attack the body they most commonly first lodge in the exterior portion, known in the six channel and four level theories of febrile diseases as the taiyang stage and defensive level respectively. Typical symptoms of this pattern are chills and fever, aversion to wind, shivering, and throat painful obstruction. If the pathogen penetrates to the interior (yangming stage or qi level) there will be high fever with agitation. If the pathogen resides between the exterior and interior (shaoyang stage) there will be alternating chills and fever, epitomised by malaria. Dàzhuī DU-14 is unique in its ability to clear pathogens from all these three stages. Zhang Zhong-jing, in the Treatise on Injury by Cold which otherwise discusses few acupuncture points, recommends needling Dàzhuī DU-14 in combination with Fèishū BL-13 and Gānshū BL-18 for the treatment of overlapping taiyang and shaoyang patterns.

According to the Ming dynasty author Zhang Jing-yue "Malaria is an exogenous disease .... only in the condition of delicate health or overstrain or stress, is one apt to be attacked by the malarial pathogenic factor". By virtue of its ability to clear pathogenic factors from shaoyang and to tonify qi and yang, Dàzhuī DU-14 is ideally suited to treat both the root and manifestation of malaria.

Dàzhuī DU-14 is one of the principal acupuncture points to treat disorders of sweating. Deficiency sweating arises either when pathogenic wind attacks the exterior and leads to disharmony of the nutritive qi and defensive qi, or when the defensive qi is deficient and unable to firm and control the pores. By virtue of its ability both to tonify the qi and to regulate the exterior, Dàzhuī DU-14 is able to treat both these forms of deficiency sweating. Night sweating and steaming bone disorder are most commonly seen in patterns of yin deficiency with heat, and here the action of Dàzhuī DU-14 is both to control the pores and clear the heat, and to tonify the deficiency.

Bailao (Hundred Taxations) is an alternative name for this point found in the Glorious Anthology of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and other classics. This name vividly illustrates the ability of Dàzhuī DU-14 to treat deficiency and exhaustion of the whole body manifesting as lack of strength, the five taxations and the seven injuries. Another indication that reflects the ability of Dàzhuī DU-14 to tonify and strengthen the body is shortness of breath with inability to speak. This is explained in the Spiritual Pivot34 which classifies Dàzhuī DU-14 (along with Rényíng ST-9, Shānzhōng REN-17 and Yǎmén DU-15) as a point of the 'sea of qi'. This passage states "When the sea of qi is deficient, there is scanty energy insufficient for speech".

According to the Treatment Strategies for Assorted Syndromes35 "Painful obstruction syndrome ... is due to deficiency of nutritive and defensive qi and to the space between skin and muscles being open, thus allowing wind-cold-dampness to ride the deficiency". Not only can underlying deficiency render a person prone to painful obstruction in this way, but if pathogenic wind-damp penetrates the bones and joints, over time it may lead to exhaustion. Dàzhuī DU-14, which is able to expel wind, regulate the pores and tonify qi, is specifically indicated for pain of the hundred joints (i.e. all the joints) and for wind-taxation (chronic painful obstruction leading to exhaustion of qi and blood).

Like many points of the Governing vessel, Dàzhuī DU-14 is able to pacify interior wind (epilepsy and acute childhood fright wind), and to benefit the entire spine, particularly in the neck region. In clinical practice, Dàzhuī DU-14 is often needled towards one or other shoulder when neck pain radiates laterally.

After ascending to the vertex, the Governing vessel descends through the midline of the nose. Dàzhuī DU-14 is indicated for nosebleed which does not stop, an indication that mirrors the folk practice of placing a key or other piece of cold metal, or a cold sponge, at the back of the neck to stop nosebleed.

Summary of clinical application
Clears pathogenic factors from taiyang (chills and fever, aversion to wind, shivering, throat painful obstruction), yangming (high fever with agitation) and shaoyang (alternating chills and fever). Treats malaria.
For night sweating, steaming bone disorder, deficiency sweating due to exterior wind or defensive qi deficiency.

# **DU-20** · BǍIHUÌ (百會) · *Hundred Meetings*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The name Bǎihuì DU-20 (Hundred Meetings) reflects the location of this point at the crown of the head which is the meeting of all the yang qi of the body, and its ability, according to the, Classic of Supplementing Life with Acupuncture and Moxibustion to treat the 'one hundred diseases'. Like many acupuncture points, Bǎihuì DU-20 has also been given a variety of alternative names in classical texts, reflecting different aspects of its nature. The name Sanyangwuhui (Three Yang Five Meetings) emphasises that Bǎihuì DU-20 is the meeting point of the Governing vessel with the three yang channels of the Bladder, Gall Bladder and Sanjiao, as well as the Liver channel. Another name, Niwangong (Mud Ball Palace), is used in qigong theory. Niwan (Mud Ball) refers to the material aspect of the spirit which is located in the brain (see also Shéntíng DU-24), and accordingly Bǎihuì DU-20 is sometimes considered to be the location of the upper dantian (cinnabar field). Further names include Tianshan (Mountain of Heaven) reflecting its location at the highest point of the body, and Guimen (Ghost Gate) reflecting its influence on psycho-emotional disorders.

Bǎihuì DU-20 is located at the apex of the head, the highest and hence most yang point of the body. It therefore has a profound effect on regulating yang, both to descend excess yang and to raise deficient yang. Interior wind is a yang pathogen characterised by vigorous upward movement and is most commonly generated when the Liver's spreading and rising movement exceeds its normal bounds. Bǎihuì DU-20, the meeting of the Governing and Liver channels, is able to descend such manifestations of interior wind and uprising of yang as windstroke, dizziness, tinnitus, headache, head wind, pain of the vertex, opisthotonos, lockjaw and loss of consciousness. A number of different classics state that Bǎihuì DU-20 should be bled in such excess patterns. The pronounced ability of this point to descend excess from the head should not obscure its importance in nourishing the brain. According to the Spiritual Pivot 41 Bǎihuì DU-20 is a point of the sea of marrow "Its point above is the top of the head; below it is Fengfu" and "When the sea of marrow is in excess then there is lightness of the body and much strength and a person's self exceeds the normal level; when the sea of marrow is insufficient there is a whirling sensation of the brain, tinnitus, pain of the lower legs, dizziness, impairment of vision, indolence and desire to sleep".

As well as treating disorders at the top of the body, Bǎihuì DU-20 is able to raise sinking of yang at the lower end of the Governing vessel leading to prolapse of the rectum. This action of raising yang has been extended in modern clinical practice to the treatment of prolapse of the uterus and vagina. For this purpose Bǎihuì DU-20 is often treated by moxibustion. Zhu Dan-xi recommends the application of three cones of moxa to Bǎihuì DU-20 for chronic disease with qi deficiency and incessant diarrhoea 42. All these indications reflect the principle stated in the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic 43 "When the disease is below select [points] from above".

This effect of raising yang is emphasised in qigong practice. Attention is focused on the upper dantian [either Bǎihuì DU-20 or Yìntáng M-HN-3] in cases of sinking of qi, aversion to wind and cold in the head, hypotension etc., but contraindicated in cases of excessive yang, fire or wind. According to the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries "Heaven, earth and man are the three powers. Bǎihuì DU-20 ... echoes Heaven, Xuánjī REN-21 ... echoes man and Yǒngquǎn KID-1 ... echoes the earth". It is by opening Bǎihuì DU-20 that we can better absorb the energy of heaven, and through focusing on Yǒngquǎn KID-1 that we can root to the energy of the earth. It is strongly emphasised, however, that since yang has a natural tendency to rise to the head, most people should first master sinking the qi to the lower dantian, in the lower abdomen, or to Yǒngquǎn KID-1, and circulating the qi through the small heavenly circuit (the Governing and Conception vessels) before focusing unduly on the upper dantian.

One of the most striking groups of indications found in classical texts for Bǎihuì DU-20 is disorders of the spirit and Heart, for example heat and oppression of the Heart, fright palpitations, poor memory, disorientation, sadness and crying with desire to die etc. As considered at length in the introductory discussion to the Governing vessel (above), this reflects the overlap between different theories in Chinese medicine concerning the residence of the spirit, some schools emphasising the Heart and others the brain. The Essential Questions for example states "The Heart stores the spirit" 44 and "The head is the residence of the intelligence" 45. As stated above, the Governing vessel, and Bǎihuì DU-20 in particular, has an especially close relationship with the brain. At the same time, the anterior pathway of the Governing vessel ascends through the Heart. The Governing vessel, therefore, can be seen as the channel which integrates these two theories, and Bǎihuì DU-20 may be selected especially when psycho-emotional disturbance manifests with indications of disharmony both of the Heart (palpitations, oppression etc.) and the head and brain (heaviness of the head, epilepsy, dizziness etc.)

From Bǎihuì DU-20, the Governing vessel starts to descend down the midline of the front of the head, traversing the nose. This point is therefore indicated for a variety of nasal disorders including discharge, obstruction and bleeding.

Finally, according to the Spiritual Pivot 46 Bǎihuì DU-20 is listed as one of a group of twenty-five points for treating headache caused by inversion qi (disordered and contrary flow of qi): Qiángjiān DU-18, Hòudǐng DU-19, Bǎihuì DU-20, Qiándǐng DU-21, Xìnhuì DU-22, Wǔchù BL-5, Chéngguāng BL-6, Tōngtiān BL-7, Luòquè BL-8, Yùzhěn BL-9, Tóulínqì GB-15, Mùchuāng GB-16, Zhèngyíng GB-17, Chénglíng GB-18 and Nǎokōng GB-19.

Summary of clinical application
“Heaven, earth and man are the three powers. Bǎihuì DU-20 echoes Heaven” (Ode to Elucidate Mysteries).
Descends interior wind and uprising of yang and nourishes the brain: windstroke, dizziness, tinnitus, headache, head wind, pain of the vertex, heaviness of the head, opisthotonos, lockjaw, loss of consciousness.
Raises yang: prolapse of the rectum, uterus and vagina, incessant diarrhoea.
Treats the brain, Heart and spirit: heat and oppression of the Heart, fright palpitations, poor memory, disorientation, sadness and crying with desire to die.
Point of the Sea of Marrow: “Its point above is the top of the head; below it is Fēngfǔ DU-16”; “When the sea of marrow is in excess then there is lightness of the body and much strength and a person’s self exceeds the normal level; when the sea of marrow is insufficient there is a whirling sensation of the brain, tinnitus, pain of the lower legs, dizziness, impairment of vision, indolence and desire to sleep” (Spiritual Pivot).

# **DU-23** · SHÀNGXĪNG (上星) · *Upper Star*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
After passing over the vertex of the head, the Governing vessel descends through the nose. Shàngxīng DU-23, located directly above the nose, is in a commanding position to regulate the widest range of nasal disorders and is an important point clinically in the treatment of nasal obstruction and discharge, pain of sinusitis, rhinitis, inability to smell, nosebleed and nasal polyps.

An alternative name for this point is Mingtang (Hall of Brightness) reflecting the fact that from the earliest times Shàngxīng DU-23 has also been considered valuable in treating eye diseases including short sightedness, eye pain, visual impairment and visual dizziness. This may be explained both by the proximity of this point to the eye region and by the fact that the anterior pathway of the Governing vessel ascends to below the middle of the eye. Interestingly, several classical texts warn that if this point is treated by excessive moxibustion it will raise the yang and lead to lack of clarity of vision.

A number of further alternative names for this point reflect its status as one of the 'thirteen ghost points' listed in the Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas of Sun Si-miao for the treatment of mania disorder and epilepsy. These include Guitang (Ghost Hall), Guigong (Ghost Palace) and Shentang (Hall of the Spirit).

Finally Shàngxīng DU-23 is indicated for various kinds of swelling in the upper region, including redness and swelling of the face, deficiency swelling of the face, and swelling of the skin of the head.

Summary of clinical application
Commonly used for nasal disorders: nasal obstruction and discharge, pain of sinusitis, rhinitis, inability to smell, nosebleed, nasal polyps.
For eye diseases: visual impairment, short sightedness, eye pain, visual dizziness.
For redness and swelling of the face, deficiency swelling of the face, and swelling of the skin of the head.

# **DU-24** · SHÉNTÍNG (神庭) · *Courtyard of the Spirit*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Shenting DU-24 (Courtyard of the Spirit) is also known as Tianting (Courtyard of Heaven). Like several of the points of the Governing vessel, it has a strong action on calming the spirit and treating epilepsy and mania disorder. It is dramatically and graphically indicated for the treatment of those who undress, climb to high places, sing and mimic other people’s speech. The action of the Governing vessel points on the spirit can be explained in three ways. Firstly, of all the channels, the Governing vessel has the closest relationship with the brain. As explained in the introductory discussion to the Governing vessel (see above) the head and brain were considered among pre-Inner Classic and later Daoist traditions to be the seat of the spirit, and one cause of mental disorders was traditionally perceived to be wind entering the brain through the Governing vessel. Secondly, the Governing vessel anterior pathway enters the Heart, and thus strongly links the brain and Heart which is more commonly understood to be the residence of the spirit. Thirdly, mania disorder is characterised by heat, and points of the Governing vessel, the ‘sea of the yang channels’, are important to clear pathogenic heat from the whole body. As far as Shenting DU-24 in particular is concerned, it is said to directly access Niwan (Mud Ball), also known as Huangting (The Yellow Courtyard). The Niwan in the Daoist tradition is the central one of the nine palaces of the brain and is considered to be the location of the material basis of the spirit. The Classic on the Central Void in the Inner Sphere said “The origin of essence-spirit in the brain is also called Niwan” and “The entire spirit that expresses in the face has its origin in Niwan”,48 whilst the Daoist Classic Collected Wisdom by Master Magic Sword stated “The qi of the Heart is connected with the Niwan Palace above”.49

The second principal action of Shenting DU-24 is to pacify pathologically ascending interior wind (upward staring eyes, dizziness and epilepsy), and to dispel exterior pathogenic wind (head wind, headache with chills and fever and cold sensation of the head). Since Shenting DU-24 is a meeting point of the Governing vessel with the Stomach channel, it is specifically indicated for wind dizziness accompanied by vomiting, and vomiting with agitation and fullness.

Finally, like Shangxing DU-23, Shenting DU-24 is indicated for a variety of nasal and eye disorders including clear and ceaseless nasal discharge, nasal congestion and discharge, nosebleed, lacrimation and lack of visual clarity. It is interesting to note, however, that a number of classics including the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and the Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man warn that this point is contraindicated for needling as it may give rise to adverse effects such as damage to the eyesight or mania.

# **DU-25** · SÙLIÁO (素髎) · *White Crevice*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
In recent times this point has been found to be effective in reducing alcohol intoxication by redirecting the route of elimination from the liver to the lung and thereby increasing the volume of alcohol present in the expired air. Other recent research has shown this point to be more effective than Rénzhōng DU-26 in restoring loss of consciousness.

# **DU-26** · RÉNZHŌNG (人中) · *Man's Middle*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The name of this point (Man’s Middle) reflects the location of this point close to the junction of the Governing and Conception vessels, and between the nose and mouth. The Governing vessel which governs all the yang channels, and the nose which receives heavenly qi, both correspond to heaven (yang). The Conception vessel which governs all the yin channels, and the mouth which receives earthly sustenance, both correspond to earth (yin). According to Chinese cosmology ‘man’ lies between heaven and earth, and Renzhong DU-26 is considered to establish connection between the two.

When the harmonious interaction of yin and yang is lost and they begin to separate, there is loss of consciousness (death being the ultimate manifestation of this separation). Renzhong DU-26 (along with Neiguan P-6) was one of two points added by later commentators to Gao Wu’s ‘four command points’ to make the ‘six command points’. In this grouping of the most essential acupuncture points, Renzhong DU-26 was indicated for resuscitation, and it is the single most important acupuncture point to revive consciousness and re-establish yin-yang harmony. In any kind of fainting or loss of consciousness, including needle shock, Renzhong DU-26 may be needled or strongly pressed (obliquely upwards towards the root of the nose). The Ode of the Golden Needle specifically recommends needling Renzhong DU-26 and Zusanli ST-36 for dizziness following needling (needle shock).

The powerful effect of Renzhong DU-26 on restoring consciousness is mirrored in its equally strong effect on calming the mind. The Governing vessel both enters the brain and connects (via its anterior pathway) with the Heart. Renzhong DU-26 is an important point in the treatment of severe psycho-emotional disorders, and is indicated in classical texts for unexpected and inappropriate laughter and crying. The importance of Renzhong DU-26 in the treatment of mania disorder and epilepsy is reflected in its inclusion under its alternative name of Guigong (Ghost Palace) among the ‘thirteen ghost points’ of Sun Si-miao for the treatment of mania disorder and epilepsy. According to the Ode of Xi-hong “the ability of Renzhong DU-26 to treat mania disorder is supreme; the thirteen ghost points must not be overlooked”.

Renzhong DU-26 is a meeting point of the Governing vessel with the hand and foot yangming (Large Intestine and Stomach) channels which dominate the face and nose. It is therefore indicated for various disorders of the nose, including blockage, discharge, bleeding and loss of sense of smell, as well as swelling of the face and wind disorders such as deviation of the face and mouth and lockjaw.

According to the Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic50 “When the disease is below select [points] from above”. Renzhong DU-26, located close to the termination of the Governing vessel, is therefore an important point clinically in the treatment of sprain of the lumbar spine, traversed by the lower portion of the Governing vessel and close to its origin. It is normally selected when the pain is acute and on the midline, and needled whilst the patient stands and rotates and bends the waist.

Summary of clinical application
Principal point to restore consciousness in any situation including needle shock (by needling or finger pressure).
Important point in the treatment of severe psycho-emotional disorders: mania-depression, epilepsy, inappropriate laughter, unexpected laughter and crying.
For acute lumbar sprain, especially on the midline of the back.

# **DU-4** · MÌNGMÉN (命門) · *Gate of Life*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The Classic of Difficulties27 said "On the left is the Kidney, on the right is ming men" whilst according to Zhang Jing-yue "Ming men resides between the Kidneys". The exact location of ming men (Gate of Life) has been described differently at different times, but as its name makes clear, Mìngmén DU-4, located between the Kidney back-shu points, is an important point to influence the ming men and the ministerial fire to which it is closely related. As well as influencing the ming men fire, Mìngmén DU-4 is a point of the Governing vessel, which is known as the 'sea of the yang channels', and therefore has a strong regulatory effect on the yang qi and the exterior portion of the body. These two considerations help explain the fact that the indications given for Mìngmén DU-4 in classical texts emphasise the treatment of heat disorders, whether interior or exterior, excess or deficient. Mìngmén DU-4 is able to drain heat manifesting as 'heat in the body like fire', steaming bone disorder and malaria. According to the Classic of Difficulties, the ministerial fire is the "root of the five zang". Mìngmén DU-4 is specifically indicated for heat of the five zang and shares this special indication with Xīnshū BL-15, the back-shu point of the Heart which dominates sovereign fire.

An alternative name for this point is Jinggong (Palace of Essence). The Governing vessel ascends through the spinal cord and enters the brain (the sea of marrow) as well as entering the Kidneys. Mìngmén DU-4 is indicated for such manifestations of Kidney essence deficiency as shaking of the head, tinnitus and dizziness, and this reflects the ability of Mìngmén DU-4 both to strengthen the Kidneys, and to open the Governing vessel and assist the ascent of essence. According to the Classic of Difficulties28 "When the Governing vessel is diseased, symptoms such as opisthotonos and fainting may occur". Mìngmén DU-4 is able to pacify wind in the Governing vessel, reflected in indications such as opisthotonos, splitting headache and epilepsy.

The Governing vessel dominates the spinal column, the pillar of the body, and as reflects its location Mìngmén DU-4 has its strongest action on the lumbar region. It may be used for rigidity and stiffness of the lumbar spine and is strongly indicated in classical sources for lumbar pain due to any kind of deficiency, especially of the Kidneys.

According to the Classic of Difficulties29 "The ming men is the residence of essence ... and stores semen in the male and connects with the uterus in the female". The anterior pathway of the Governing vessel encircles the genitals, and Mìngmén DU-4 is indicated for such disorders as seminal emission, white turbidity and leucorrhoea.

The Governing vessel winds around the anus, and like several of the lower points of this channel, Mìngmén DU-4 is indicated for prolapse of the rectum, haemorrhoids and blood in the stool.

Despite the common perception of Mìngmén DU-4 as a major point to tonify and warm the ming men fire, it is remarkable that there are no clear classical indications for Kidney yang deficiency (compared for example with Shènshū BL-23, Guānyuán REN-4 and Qìhǎi REN-6). Interestingly, however, the classical combinations for this point much more strongly emphasise its yang tonifying properties (see below).

Finally, according to qigong theory, there are three important gates or passes (sanguan) in the practice of qi circulation through the Governing vessel. These gates, through which it is more difficult to circulate the qi are the Coccyx Pass (Weiluguan) in the region of Chángqiáng DU-1, the Lumbar Pass (Jiajiguan) in the region of Mìngmén DU-4, and the Occipital Pass (Yuzhenwan) in the region of Yùzhěn BL-9.

Summary of clinical application
Clears heat: ‘heat in the body like fire’, heat of the five zang, steaming bone disorder, malaria.
Nourishes the Kidneys and regulates the Governing vessel: shaking of the head, tinnitus, dizziness, opisthotonos, splitting headache, epilepsy.
Treats stiffness and pain of the lumbar region.
Treats disorders of the genitals and anus: seminal emission, white turbidity, leucorrhoea, prolapse of the rectum, haemorrhoids, blood in the stool.

# **DU-9** · ZHÌYÁNG (至陽) · *Reaching Yang*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Zhiyang DU-9 is located at the level of Geshu BL-17 (Diaphragm Shu). The diaphragm separates the middle and upper jiao, and Zhiyang DU-9 acts on both these areas. In fact an alternative name for this point is Feidi (Bottom of the Lung), again reflecting its location at the intersection of these two jiao.

In the middle jiao it is able to tonify and warm the Stomach and Spleen (cold in the Stomach, inability to eat, emaciation), as well as to drain dampness or damp-heat, especially of exterior origin (heaviness of the four limbs, and general malaise of the body). In modern clinical practice this point is much emphasised in the treatment of jaundice and was classically indicated for the five types of jaundice.

In the upper jiao it is able to unbind the chest (fullness of the chest and lateral costal region, cough and dyspnoea), and in common with many of the points of the Governing vessel is indicated for stiffness of the spine and lumbar pain.

Finally in the Essential Questions30 Zhiyang DU-9 is indicated for heat in the Kidneys. This indication clearly fell out of favour and was not mentioned in subsequent texts.

Summary of clinical application
Commonly used for jaundice.
For cold and deficient Stomach and Spleen (cold in the Stomach, inability to eat, emaciation, diminished qi difficulty in speaking) and dampness (heaviness of the four limbs).
Also for disorders of the upper jiao: fullness of the chest and lateral costal region, cough, dyspnoea.
