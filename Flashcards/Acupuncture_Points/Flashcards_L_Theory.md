# **LU-1** · ZHŌNGFǓ (中府) · *Middle Palace*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Zhōngfǔ LU-1 is the front-mu point of the Lung. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body. Zhōngfǔ LU-1, like all the front-mu points, therefore acts primarily on the Lung zang rather than the Lung channel. 
According to the Spiritual Pivot1 "The Lung is the canopy of the five zang and the six fu". As the uppermost zang, the Lung receives via respiration the clear qi of heaven (qing qi) in the same way that the canopy of a forest receives the light and air essential for life. Through inhalation, the Lung descends the qi to the Kidneys, and through exhalation, the Lung disseminates qi to the surface of the body and expels waste qi. The Lung is therefore said to dominate respiration and to both descend and disseminate the qi. 
These functions may be impaired either when the Lung qi is deficient, or when excess pathogenic factors (whether internally or externally generated) obstruct the Lung. The forte of Zhōngfǔ LU-1 is to clear excess of all kinds from the Lung, whether due to exterior pathogenic factors (e.g. wind-cold or wind-heat) which penetrate to the Lung zang, or to internally generated disharmony (e.g. turbid phlegm or phlegm-heat, qi stagnation etc.). In all such cases there will be dyspnoea, coughing or wheezing and an oppressive full sensation of the chest, thus the Spiritual Pivot2 says "The Lung stores the qi ... when excess there is dyspnoea and fullness of the chest with an upturned face". These symptoms will often be exacerbated on lying down, which places more strain on the Lung descending function as well as allowing phlegm to accumulate, thus the Essential Questions3 says "The Lung is the canopy of the zang. When Lung qi is abundant, the mai [pulse] is large; when the mai is large, [the patient] is unable to lie flat". 
According to the Spiritual Pivot4 "Lung qi opens into the nose; when the Lung is in harmony, the nose will distinguish the fragrant from the foul". Zhōngfǔ LU-1, although primarily used to regulate the Lung zang, is indicated when excess type Lung patterns are accompanied by such Lung channel disorders as nasal obstruction and throat painful obstruction. 
According to a saying of Chinese medicine "The Lung is the upper source of water". The Lung can be compared to a lid, for example the lid of a teapot. When the lid is too tight, the tea cannot pour, and when the Lung in the upper body is in excess, the fluids remain above and are not excreted below. Zhōngfǔ LU-1 is indicated for acute swelling of the face which occurs when exterior pathogenic wind obstructs the Lung's function of regulating the water passages and descending body fluids. 
The Lung and the Stomach both dominate descending, and disharmony of one may affect the other. If Lung qi accumulates above, it may adversely influence the descending function of the Stomach, giving rise to difficult ingestion, vomiting, retching, and abdominal distention. Conversely, obstruction in the Stomach may impair the Lung descending function leading to cough, dyspnoea and wheezing. In Essential Questions5 Qi Bo, the Yellow Emperor's minister, explains that cough may originate in any of the zangfu and says "When cold food and drink enters the Stomach, it may rise upwards by way of the Lung channel to the Lung, leading to cold in the Lung". The name of this point 'Middle Palace' refers to the origin of the Lung channel, which arises in the middle jiao (in the region of the Stomach) and descends to the Large Intestine before ascending to emerge at Zhōngfǔ LU-1. Zhōngfǔ LU-1, therefore, is especially indicated in this dual disharmony of the Lung and Stomach. Interestingly, Zhōngfǔ LU-1 is also indicated for Gall Bladder heat vomiting, perhaps reflecting the five phase theory that metal (the Lung) is able to control wood (Gall Bladder). 
According to the Essential Questions6 "The Lung dominates the skin ... of the entire body". The Spiritual Pivot7 states "when the pathogen is in the Lung there will be painful skin, chills and fever, rebellious qi, dyspnoea and sweating." Zhōngfǔ LU-1 is one of the few acupuncture points indicated for the painful skin which can commonly accompany exterior diseases. Finally, the Essential Questions8 includes Zhōngfǔ LU-1 among the eight points to clear heat from the chest (bilateral Quēpén ST-12, Dàzhù BL-11, Zhōngfǔ LU-1 and Fēngmén BL-12).
Summary of clinical application
Primarily used for excess pathogenic factors obstructing the Lung: cough, coughing of turbid phlegm, coughing blood and pus, dyspnoea, asthma, wheezing, fullness and oppression of the chest, chest pain. 
Also when such patterns are accompanied by congestion of the nose and throat or swelling of the face. 
Also when such patterns are accompanied by vomiting, retching and abdominal distention (the Lung channel originates in the middle jiao). 
As the front-mu point mainly treats the zang rather than the channel.

# **LU-2** · YÚNMÉN (雲門) · *Cloud Gate*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
According to the Essential Questions9 Yúnmén LU-2 is one of the eight points for draining heat from the extremities (although in fact only seven are listed, since Yāoshū DU-2 is on the midline) namely Yúnmén LU-2, Jiānyú L.I.-15, Wěizhōng BL-40 and Yāoshū DU-2. This is reflected in the indication for this point found in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion "injury by cold giving rise to persistent heat in the limbs".

Summary of clinical application
Rarely used, except for pain in the antero-medial portion of the shoulder.

# **LU-3** · TIĀNFǓ (天府) · *Palace of Heaven*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
According to the Discourse Into the Origins and Development of Medicine "The Lung is the delicate zang, neither heat nor cold is appropriate ... too hot and the fire will melt the metal and the blood will stir". As early as the Spiritual Pivot10 Tiānfǔ LU-3 was indicated for "Sudden and severe thirst, internal rebellion, Liver and Lung struggle against each other, blood overflows from the mouth and nose". This quotation is a clear reference to the pattern of Liver fire attacking the Lung. A branch of the Liver channel crosses the diaphragm and scatters in the Lung, and if Liver fire rushes upwards and scorches the Lung it may injure both the blood vessels (causing reckless pouring of blood from the mouth and nose), and the fluids (giving rise to thirst). At the same time there will usually be cough, which is characterised in this pattern by bouts of spasmodic coughing with a red face, or dyspnoea or asthma which is typically induced or worsened by frustration or anger.

The above passage in the Spiritual Pivot lists Tiānfǔ LU-3 among five 'Window of Heaven' points. Tiānfǔ LU-3 shares with these points the common actions of i. treating goitre due to stag-nation of qi and phlegm in the neck region, ii. descending the qi of the Lung, and iii. benefiting the sensory orifices, in this case the eyes (visual dizziness and short-sightedness). It is also interesting to note that its ability to treat goitre as well as eye diseases is shared by three points of the upper arm, Tiānfǔ LU-3, Bìnào L.I.-14 and Qūyuán SI-13. There is no apparent explanation why these points, rather than more distal ones, should have such an action, and this is predominantly a reflection of empirical observation.

According to Chinese medicine the Lung stores the corporeal soul (po), one of the five aspects of the spirit (when this term is used in its widest sense). Tiānfǔ LU-3 'Palace of Heaven' is indicated for a range of psycho-emotional disorders characterised by sadness, weeping, disorientation and forgetfulness as well as for somnolence and insomnia.

Tiānfǔ LU-3 is also indicated for 'floating corpse ghost talk'. This term probably refers to the delirious speech seen in the terminal stages of pulmonary tuberculosis. Sun Si-miao in his Thousand Ducat Formulas specifically refers to 'melancholy crying ghost talk' in relation to this point, and it was this great physician himself who classified pulmonary tuberculosis (known at that time as feishi - flying corpse) as a disease of the Lung rather than one involving demonic possession. An alternative explanation is that the term does in fact refer to raving or nonsensical speech attributed to demonic possession. A contemporary book on Chinese folk beliefs11 explains "In cases where the ghost's (i.e. evil spirit's) influence was the result of a gradual process, the victim would initially be sad, sensitive, and withdrawn. As the ghost's powers over the victim's mind became stronger, he would begin to behave as if he were in a dream, talk about ghostly matters, or act as if he were conversing with ghosts".

Summary of clinical application

For Liver fire attacking the Lung: cough, asthma, wheezing, spitting blood, coughing blood. 
Treats the corporeal soul (po): sadness, weeping, insomnia, disorientation and forgetfulness. 
Window of Heaven point: goitre, and sense organ (eye) disorders.

# **LU-5** · CHǏZÉ (尺澤) · *Cubit Marsh*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Chǐzé LU-5 is the water and he-sea point of the Lung channel. Its principal action is to clear all forms of heat (whether excess or deficient) from the Lung, and to descend Lung qi.

Excess heat in the Lung may be due to interior or exterior factors. Interior factors include smoking, over-consumption of rich, greasy, spicy food and alcohol, transformation of long-standing retention of phlegm-damp into phlegm-heat, and invasion by Liver fire. Exterior factors include pathogenic wind-cold or wind-heat which penetrate the Lung zang and transform into heat. Deficiency heat in the Lung may be due either to depletion and exhaustion of Lung and Kidney yin, or to damage to Lung yin by long-standing or repeated attacks of excess heat. The presence of any form of heat in the Lung will disturb its function of descending qi and lead to such symptoms of rebellion of Lung qi as coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing and asthma. In the case of excess heat there may be coughing of phlegm and agitation and fullness of the chest, whilst in cases of deficiency heat there may be tidal fever or taxation fever and dry mouth and tongue.

Whilst equally applicable to cases of both excess and deficiency heat, the appropriate combination of Chǐzé LU-5 with other points will determine the different approach required in the treatment of these two conditions. In the case of excess heat, characterised by fullness in the chest and expectoration of yellow, green or brown phlegm, it may be combined with points to transform phlegm and clear heat such as Fēnglóng ST-40 and Zhōngfǔ LU-1. In the case of deficiency heat, characterised by dry mouth and tongue and tidal fever or taxation fever, it may be combined with points to nourish yin and moisten the Lung such as Tàiyuān LU-9, Gāohuāngshū BL-43 and Tàixī KID-3.

According to the Classic of Difficulties12 he-sea points are indicated for "counterflow qi and diarrhoea", whilst the Spiritual Pivot says "in disorders of the Stomach and in disorders resulting from irregular eating and drinking, select the he-sea point"13. The Lung and Stomach both dominate descending whilst the Lung channel arises in the middle jiao, in the region of the Stomach. In addition to descending rebellious Lung qi, Chǐzé LU-5 also treats vomiting due to rebellious Stomach qi, as well as diarrhoea and abdominal distention.

The Discourse Into the Origins and Development of Medicine says "The Lung is the delicate zang, neither heat nor cold is appropriate ... too hot and the fire will melt the metal and the blood will stir". Heat in the Lung, whether of deficient or excess type, may injure the blood vessels and give rise to reckless bleeding, characterised by coughing or spitting of blood or nosebleed. As well as being indicated for heat-induced bleeding from the Lung, due to its secondary action of descending Stomach qi Chǐzé LU-5 may also be used for vomiting blood. The Song of Points for Miscellaneous Diseases states uncompromisingly "In cases of vomiting blood the action of Chǐzé LU-5 is without comparison"14.

The close relationship of the Lung to body fluids is emphasised in two sayings of Chinese medicine "The Lung is the upper source of water" and "The Lung dominates the movement of water". If exterior pathogenic wind obstructs the Lung's function of regulating the water passages and descending body fluid, there may be urinary retention as well as swelling of the four limbs. If the Lung is deficient, there may be enuresis or frequent urination. Chǐzé LU-5 is indicated in both these patterns.

The Lung and Heart dominate the upper jiao and share an intimate relationship. The Warp and Woof of Warm Febrile Disease says "The Lung and Heart are mutually connected; when there is Lung heat it most easily enters the Heart". When Lung heat transmits to the Heart there will be agitation, whilst if heat condenses the blood and gives rise to blood stasis, there will be Heart pain. In both these situations Chǐzé LU-5 is indicated.

Occupying a central position along the Lung channel, Chǐzé LU-5 has an important effect on the whole upper limb, and is indicated for disorders of the channel in the shoulder, upper arm, elbow and hand characterised by pain and restricted motion. Migratory pain due to attack of pathogenic wind-damp is known as wandering painful obstruction or wind painful obstruction, and as well as being indicated for wandering painful obstruction of the upper arm and elbow, Chǐzé LU-5 appears in classical combinations for wind painful obstruction of the whole body. Many classical sources particularly mention the ability of Chǐzé LU-5 to relax contraction of the sinews, for example the Song of the Jade Dragon says "In contraction of the sinews with difficulty in opening and extending the hand, the use of Chǐzé LU-5 should always be emphasised". Its use in the treatment of pain and contraction of the elbow is self-evident, and it is especially useful in the treatment of tennis elbow in preference to Qūchí L.I.-11, as a needle inserted at Chǐzé LU-5 can be more easily directed towards the area of acute focalised tenderness. Chǐzé LU-5 is also indicated for swelling and pain of the knee (crane's knee wind) reflecting the commonly used 'cross-connection' method of needling the equivalently positioned joint in the upper limb to treat disorders of the lower limb and vice-versa.

Interestingly, Chǐzé LU-5 also treats 'the five types of lumbar pain'. In a sense this point, located in the flexure of the elbow joint, can be viewed as the equivalent on the upper limb of Wěizhōng BL-40 which is located in the flexure of the knee joint and is much used for lumbar pain.
