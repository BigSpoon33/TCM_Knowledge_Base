# **SP-1** · YǏNBÀI (隱白) · *Hidden White*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
According to the Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas "The Spleen gathers the blood; when the Spleen is deficient it is unable to unite the blood", whilst the Treatise on Disorders of Blood states "When Spleen yang is deficient it is unable to gather the blood". Yǐnbài SP-1, the jing-well point of the Spleen channel, is one of the foremost acupuncture points for strengthening the Spleen's function of holding blood in its proper place. When this function is impaired there will be haemorrhage, usually chronic in nature, and occurring in any part of the body but most commonly in the lower jiao, whether as uterine bleeding or as bleeding into the urine or stools. In such cases moxibustion (either by moxa stick or direct cones) at Yǐnbài SP-1 is frequently employed, and it is particularly helpful to instruct the patient in the daily use of moxibustion at home. The action of Yǐnbài SP-1 on stopping bleeding, however, is not confined to cases of Spleen deficiency, but may also be applied where heat enters the blood level giving rise to reckless bleeding. This may manifest either in the lower or the upper part of the body (for example nosebleed or vomiting of blood). In these cases, needling or pricking to bleed is the usual method employed, although some physicians prefer to use moxibustion, despite the presence of heat.

The Essential Questions1 states "Dampness, swelling and fullness all pertain to the Spleen". Yǐnbài SP-1 is able to regulate the Spleen in the treatment of disorders such as abdominal distention, swelling of the limbs, diarrhoea etc., but as the jing-well and therefore most dynamic point of the Spleen channel, is principally indicated when these disorders are acute and of sudden onset.

According to the Classic of Difficulties2 jing-well points are indicated for "fullness below the Heart". Whilst the region 'below the Heart' specifically refers to the upper epigastrium, like many of the jing-well points Yǐnbài SP-1 treats fullness in the chest region as a whole. The Spleen primary channel ascends through the chest and lateral costal regions, connecting with points Rìyuè GB-24 Qímén LIV-14 and Zhōngfǔ LU-1, and terminates at Dàbāo SP-21 from where the great luo-connecting channel of the Spleen, like the Spleen sinew channel, spreads into the chest, ribs and lateral costal region. Yǐnbài SP-1, as the starting point of the channel, is especially effective at treating the opposite end of the channel and is indicated for a variety of disorders such as heat in the chest, fullness of the chest, dyspnoea and sighing.

The Spleen channel links with the Heart, reinforcing the close physiological relationship between the two zang. Yǐnbài SP-1, like many of the jing-well points, is indicated for disorders of the Heart and spirit, in this case agitation of the Heart, mania-depression and propensity to sadness. Like Lìduì ST-45, it is especially used for insomnia with excessive or restless dreaming and nightmares, and in clinical practice these two points may be combined for this purpose. Such is its action on the spirit that it was included by Sun Si-miao under its alternative name of Guilei (Ghost Fortress) among the 'thirteen ghost points' for the treatment of mania-depression and epilepsy.

Finally, Yǐnbài SP-1 shares with most of the other jing-well points the action of reviving and restoring the senses and is indicated for loss of consciousness.

# **SP-10** · XUÈHǍI (血海) · *Sea of Blood*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The name of Xuèhǎi SP-10 (Sea of Blood) reflects its pre-eminent role in treating various disorders at the blood level. It is generally recognised as having two principal actions: i. invigorating the blood and dispelling stasis, and ii. cooling the blood. These two actions find their expression in its ability to treat a wide range of gynaecological and dermatological disorders due either to blood stasis or to heat in the blood.

As far as gynaecology is concerned, normal menstruation depends on a number of factors including the smooth circulation of blood. Impairment of blood circulation and consequent stasis may be due to a variety of causes including stagnation or deficiency of qi, traumatic injury, haemorrhage, penetration of cold or heat, chronic disease or emotional factors, and may give rise to many different disorders of menstruation. These include dysmenorrhoea and uterine bleeding characterised by severe fixed pain and the discharge of dark or clotted blood, and amenorrhoea accompanied by distention and pain, a purple coloured tongue and a choppy pulse. By contrast, if heat enters the blood level, most frequently due to internally generated heat from the Liver or Heart or overconsumption of excessively heating foods, then two principal conditions may arise: i. the movement of blood may become reckless and overflow its bounds leading to profuse uterine bleeding, or less commonly, the heat may desiccate the blood leading to amenorrhoea. In both cases there will be signs of heat such as a red dry tongue and a rapid pulse. In fact, both the blood cooling and blood invigorating properties of Xuèhǎi SP-10 come together in its ability to treat uterine bleeding. Blood heat is the most commonly seen pattern of uterine bleeding, but as well as cooling blood, treatment must emphasise resolving stasis, since any pathological bleeding may lead to pooling and stagnation of extravasated blood. This is expressed in the Chinese medicine saying "where there is haemorrhage there is stasis". The close inter-relationship between blood heat and blood stasis is further illustrated by the fact that blood heat may condense and dry the blood giving rise to stasis, as stated in the Treatise on Epidemic Warm Febrile Disease18 "Because latent stagnant fire evaporates the blood's fluid, the blood simmers and forms stasis".

Some authorities further attribute blood nourishing properties to Xuèhǎi SP-10 and incorporate it into prescriptions for the treatment of blood deficiency. In the light of Xuèhǎi SP-10's pre-eminence in invigorating blood, this action reflects the saying in Chinese medicine "if blood stasis is not transformed, new blood cannot be generated". This refers to situations where blood stasis has pooled outside the channels, leading directly to blood deficiency as sufficient blood is no longer available to nourish the body. This complex pattern of haemorrhage with both consequent blood stasis and blood deficiency is commonly encountered after childbirth and profuse uterine bleeding.

As far as dermatology is concerned, blood disharmony often plays a central role. The main dermatological patterns treated by Xuèhǎi SP-10 are heat in the blood level characterised by red lesions, and blood stasis characterised by purple lesions. Xuèhǎi SP-10 may also be used for the concomitant blood deficiency and stasis seen for example in eczema with thickening of the skin (lichenification) or post-herpetic neuralgia. Xuèhǎi SP-10 may also be used to treat the manifestations of wind in skin diseases, the most important of which is intolerable itching. This illustrates the Chinese medicine saying "to treat wind first treat the blood; once blood moves wind will be dispelled".

Although the action of Xuèhǎi SP-10 on invigorating and cooling blood is classically confined to the two principal areas of gynaecology and dermatology, there are in fact relatively few acupuncture points able to treat the blood directly. For this reason, its application may be extended to any disorder in the body with these pathologies. Thus the Song of the Primary Points of the Fourteen Channels says "Xuèhǎi SP-10 can treat all blood diseases".

Summary of clinical application
One of the main points to move blood stasis and cool blood heat, principally in menstrual and skin disorders: irregular menstruation, dysmenorrhoea, amenorrhoea, uterine bleeding, uterine bleeding containing clots, urticaria, eczema, erysipelis (cinnabar toxin), herpes zoster, painful hot sores. “Xuèhǎi SP-10 can treat all blood diseases” (Song of the Primary Points of the Fourteen Channels).
Ascribed some action of nourishing blood, especially when allied with blood stasis: “If blood stasis is not transformed, new blood cannot be generated”.

# **SP-12** · CHŌNGMÉN (沖門) · *Rushing Gate*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Chōngmén SP-12 is a coalescent point of the Yin Linking vessel. The Classic of Difficulties says "When the Yin Linking vessel is diseased, Heart pain will result"19. Chōngmén SP-12 (Rushing Gate), like Qìchōng ST-30 (Rushing Qi), is indicated for foetal qi rushing up to the Heart. This condition, described by Zhu Dan-xi, manifests as distention, fullness and pain of the abdomen and Heart in a pregnant woman, and is common in the later stages of pregnancy.

Summary of clinical application
For foetal qi rushing up to the Heart: distention, fullness and pain of the abdomen and Heart in a pregnant woman. “When the Yin Linking vessel is diseased, Heart pain will result” (Classic of Difficulties).

# **SP-15** · DÀHÉNG (大横) · *Great Horizontal*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Dàhéng SP-15 is an important point for regulating the qi of the Large Intestine. It is indicated for the treatment of diarrhoea, especially of cold or damp type, and due to its ability to move the qi of the Large Intestine is also used in the treatment of constipation due to many different aetiologies. Both Dàhéng SP-15 and Tiānshū ST-25, its neighbouring point, are effective in the treatment of a variety of disorders of the intestines. Clinically, however, Tiānshū ST-25 is predominantly used for loose stools, diarrhoea and dysenteric disorder, whilst Dàhéng SP-15 is favoured for constipation.

Dàhéng SP-15 is also indicated and included in classical combinations for sadness, weeping and sighing. Whilst there is no special theoretical reason why Dàhéng SP-15 should have this action, it is interesting to compare it with its neighbouring points Tàiyǐ ST-23 and Huaroumen ST‑24 which also have several psycho-emotional indications.

Summary of clinical application
Commonly used for constipation, often in preference to Tianshu ST-25. Also indicated for cold or damp diarrhoea and dysenteric disorder
Like Taiyi ST-23 and Huaroumen ST-24, treats disorders of the spirit: propensity to sadness, sighing.

# **SP-17** · SHÍDÒU (食竇) · *Food Cavity*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Shídòu SP-17 is also known by the alternative name of Mingguan (Gate of Life). According to the Book of Bian Que's Secrets Shídòu SP-17 "connects the real Spleen qi and cures thirty-six kinds of Spleen disease. In severe disease, when life is hanging by a thread, moxibustion at this point with 200-300 moxa cones will assure the patient's survival. Use this point in any major Spleen disease"20. Despite this inspiring quotation, there are few references to this kind of application or combinations which include the point, in other classical texts, and Shídòu SP-17 is mainly indicated for pain of the lateral costal region, distention and pain of the abdomen and diaphragm with belching, vomiting and indigested food in the stool, all clear indications of food stagnation.
Summary of clinical application
According to the Book of Bian Que’s Secrets Shidou SP-17 “connects the real Spleen qi and cures thirty-six kinds of Spleen disease.

# **SP-21** · DÀBĀO (大包) · *Great Wrapping*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The name of the point Dàbāo SP-21 is made up of two characters, 'Da' meaning great, and 'Bao' meaning 'to wrap', or 'to envelop'. According to the Spiritual Pivot21 "The great luo of the Spleen is known as Dabao; it emerges at three cun below the axilla spreading in the chest and lateral costal region. When it is excess there is pain of the whole body. When it is deficient the hundred joints are flaccid. This channel embraces the blood of all the luo [connecting channels]".

A possible explanation of this passage from the Spiritual Pivot is that one of the functions of the luo-connecting channels in general is to assist in the distribution of qi, and more especially blood, to all the tissues of the body via the network of the minute luo-connecting channels. Since the Spleen controls blood, its great luo-connecting channel dominates this function of blood distribution throughout the body. When blood stagnates "there is pain of the whole body"; when blood is deficient and unable to nourish the tissues "the hundred joints are flaccid".

Dàbāo SP-21 is also mentioned in the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries which says that it dominates the upper region (Tiānshū ST-25 dominates the middle region and Dìjī SP-8 dominates the lower region). Despite these two classical references, Dàbāo SP-21 appears in no traditional combinations in any of the major classical texts.

Summary of clinical application
The great-luo connecting point of the Spleen which is said to embrace the blood of all the luo-connecting channels: pain of the whole body, weariness of the four limbs, flaccidity of the limbs, flaccidity of the hundred joints.

# **SP-6** · SĀNYĪNJIĀO (三陰交) · *Three Yin Intersection*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 (Three Yin Intersection) is the meeting point of the three yin channels of the leg (Spleen, Liver and Kidney) and is one of the most important and widely used of the acupuncture points. Its actions and indications are extraordinarily broad, and it is a primary point in the treatment of many digestive, gynaecological, sexual, urinary and emotional disorders.

Located on the Spleen channel, its strongest action is on harmonising all the functions of the Spleen. The Spleen dominates transportation and transformation and is thus the primary zang responsible for the formation of qi and blood. When Spleen qi or yang is deficient there may be: i. impairment of the transportation and transformation function (undigested food in the stool, diarrhoea, abdominal distention and fullness, borborygmus etc.), ii. inadequate formation of blood (palpitations, blurred vision, amenorrhoea, post-partum dizziness, dizziness associated with uterine bleeding etc.), iii. failure of the Spleen to hold the blood (uterine bleeding, menorrhagia), and iv. sinking of central qi (uterine prolapse). Furthermore, deficiency of Spleen qi and incomplete transportation and transformation may lead to the formation of excess dampness. According to the Essential Questions11 "The lower is the first to suffer from dampness". Dampness, whether damp-heat or cold damp, may lead to heaviness of the body and limbs and oedema, or pour down to the lower jiao giving rise to such symptoms as diarrhoea or leucorrhoea. Sānyīnjiāo SP-6, exceptionally balanced in its action, is unique among points of the Spleen channel in being able to treat all these different manifestations of Spleen disharmony.

Although its primary action is on the Spleen, Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is also an important point to treat disorders of the Liver and Kidneys. It is able to soften and harmonise the Liver, by both spreading the Liver qi and nourishing Liver blood, and at the same time to benefit the Kidney qi. This threefold action of harmonising the Spleen, Liver and Kidneys finds expression in the forte of Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 in treating all disorders of the lower jiao.

The three leg yin channels dominate menstruation, conception, pregnancy, leucorrhoea and the external genitalia. Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is the single most important distal point in the treatment of any gynaecological, obstetrical or post-partum disorder whether characterised by deficiency of qi, blood, yin, yang or Kidney essence, failure of Spleen qi to hold the blood, or stagnation of qi, blood, dampness, damp-heat or phlegm. So wide is its range of action, and so universal its indications, that Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 appears in classical combinations for the treatment of virtually any disorder of the reproductive system. Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is also an essential point to induce labour, assist in transverse presentation and alleviate the pain of childbirth. Despite its indication for restless foetus syndrome, however, its ability to expedite delivery of the live or dead foetus, and the lochia, means that Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is generally contraindicated in pregnancy.

According to the Essential Questions12 "The genitals are the gathering place of the sinews". The Spleen sinew channel binds at the genitals and Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is an essential point in the treatment of sexual and genital disorders in both men and women, including pain and contraction, seminal emission, impotence, and excessive sexual drive in men. Although impotence is generally related to deficiency of Kidney fire, two classics help to explain its relationship to the Spleen. The Complete Works of Jing-yue says "Ming men [the fire of the gate of life stored in the Kidneys] is the sea of the essence and blood, the Spleen is the sea of water and grain; the two together form the foundation of the five zang and six fu", whilst the Essential Questions13 explains "The Kidneys dominate water; they receive essence from the five zang and six fu and store it, therefore only when the five zang are flourishing is ejaculation possible".

Disharmony of the Liver, Spleen or Kidneys is responsible for the majority of urinary disorders, and the principal patterns are accumulation of damp-heat or cold damp, Kidney deficiency, qi deficiency, stagnation of Liver qi or Liver fire. Due to its ability to treat all these pathologies, Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is an essential point for the treatment of urinary disorders, including difficult urination, retention of urine, enuresis, painful urinary dysfunction and cloudy urine.

The actions of Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 are not, however, confined to the middle and lower jiao. Its inclusion in many prescriptions for the treatment of any kind of insomnia (usually in combination with Shénmén HE-7) dramatically illustrates its wide-ranging actions. Insomnia is normally differentiated into five main patterns: i. deficiency of Heart and Spleen (qi and blood deficiency), ii. disharmony of Heart and Kidneys (yin deficiency), iii. disharmony of Heart and Liver (Liver blood and yin deficiency or Liver fire), iv. deficiency of Heart and Gall Bladder (qi deficiency), v. disharmony of Heart and Stomach (accumulation of food or retention of phlegm-heat). Since Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is able to fortify the Spleen, tonify qi and blood, nourish Liver and Kidney yin, spread the Liver qi and harmonise the digestion it may be used in any of these patterns.

The especial importance of treating the Spleen in cases of disharmony of the Heart and Kidneys is emphasised in a number of classics. The Standards of Patterns and Treatments says "In order to tonify the Kidneys it is best to tonify the Spleen; use the Spleen to connect with the Heart in the upper and with the Kidneys in the lower ..." and "The essence of the five zang is all transported from the Spleen; when the Spleen is flourishing then the Heart and Kidneys are in communication". The Helpful Questions in Medical Cases says "If you desire to establish communication between the Heart and the Kidneys it is necessary to use the Spleen earth as an intermediary".

Along with Géshū BL-17, Xuèhǎi SP-10 and Dìjī SP-8, Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is considered one of the most important acupuncture points to harmonise and cool blood and to promote and invigorate its circulation. This action finds its most important application in the treatment of gynaecological disorders, but extends to other disorders where blood disharmony plays an important role, for example skin diseases such as eczema and urticaria.

Finally Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is cited in the Song of the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang, for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc.

Summary of clinical application
Tonifies the middle jiao and resolves dampness: heavy body, heaviness of the four limbs, oedema, borborygmus, diarrhoea, undigested food (in the stool), abdominal distention, cold abdomen, no desire to eat and drink, vomiting, damp painful obstruction, atrophy disorder and painful obstruction of the lower limbs, eczema.
Regulates the uterus and menstruation: irregular menstruation, uterine bleeding, menorrhagia, amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea, abdominal masses, leucorrhoea, uterine prolapse, infertility, restless foetus syndrome, transverse presentation, difficult labour, retention of lochia, post-partum dizziness.
Regulates the sexual function and genitals: seminal emission, sexual hyperactivity in men, impotence, pain of the genitals, pain of the penis, contracted testicles, shan disorder.
Regulates urination: difficult urination, enuresis, painful urinary dysfunction, cloudy urine.
Calms the spirit: palpitations, insomnia, Gall Bladder deficiency.

# **SP-7** · LÒUGǓ (漏谷) · *Dripping Valley*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Although not a commonly used point clinically, Lòugǔ SP-7 is indicated for "wasting of the muscles and flesh despite normal eating and drinking". This condition is referred to by Li Dong-yuan in the Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach which said "There are also cases of thinness despite eating well. [This is due to] hidden Stomach fire at the qi level resulting in large food intake; Spleen deficiency leads to withered flesh"14.

Summary of clinical application
Indicated for “wasting of the muscles and flesh despite normal eating and drinking”. This condition is referred to by Li Dongyuan in the Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach which said “There are also cases of thinness despite eating well. [This is due to] hidden Stomach fire at the qi level resulting in large food intake; Spleen deficiency leads to withered flesh”
Also indicated for abdominal fullness, borborygmus, diarrhoea, painful belching, oedema, difficult urination, swelling of the ankle, sadness with counterflow qi, seminal emission, paralysis of the legs, leg qi, inversion counterflow of the legs and knees, painful obstruction of the knees.
