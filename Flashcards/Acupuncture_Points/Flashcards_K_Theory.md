# **BL-23** · SHÈNSHŪ (腎俞) · *Kidney Shu*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Shènshū BL-23 is the back-shu point of the Kidney zang where the qi of the Kidneys emanates from the interior to the body surface, and like all the back-shu points (especially those of the zang) has a strong action on regulating and tonifying its corresponding zangfu at the deepest level. Shènshū BL-23 is one of the principal acupuncture points to strengthen the Kidneys, fortify yang, nourish yin, and benefit essence.

According to the Spiritual Pivot37 "The Kidneys store the essence" and "essence is the source of life". The Essential Questions38 states "Essence is the root of the human body", whilst a saying of Chinese medicine emphasises "The Kidney is the root of pre-heaven". Since neither essence nor pre-heaven qi can ever be excessive, the Kidneys can only suffer from deficiency patterns. Kidney deficiency may be congenital in origin, or may develop during the course of a person's life as a result of chronic illness, dissipation, excessive sexual activity, overwork, old age, prolonged fear, or prolonged disharmony of other zangfu which eventually transmits to the Kidneys. Deficiency of the Kidneys is subdivided into the following patterns: i. Kidney qi not firm, ii. Failure of the Kidneys to grasp the qi, iii. deficiency of Kidney essence, iv. deficiency of Kidney yang, v. deficiency of Kidney yin. Shènshū BL-23 is an essential point in the treatment of all these patterns.

The Kidneys dominate the two lower yin (urethra and anus) and control the opening and closing of the Bladder and its qi transformation function. Deficiency of the Kidney qi (Kidney qi not firm) therefore, may impair the Kidneys' ability to firmly hold and astringe the urine resulting in such symptoms of leakage as frequent urination, dripping urination, enuresis, white turbidity due to deficiency and exhaustion etc.

According to the Master Hua's Classic of the Central Viscera by the great Han dynasty physician Hua Tuo, the Kidneys "serve the purpose of shutting in the essence in males"39. Deficiency of Kidney qi, therefore, may give rise to leakage of essence manifesting as seminal emission, seminal emission with dreams, urine containing semen and premature ejaculation. This kind of leakage may be seen in the context of qi deficiency alone (in other words without accompanying symptoms of cold or heat), or as part of deficiency of either Kidney yang or Kidney yin, more commonly the former since qi belongs to the broad category of yang. Whatever the pattern, Shènshū BL-23 is an important point to firm the holding and astringing action of the Kidneys.

The Kidneys control the movement of water throughout the body, and although the Spleen and Lung also play an important role in the circulation of fluids, their yang qi is ultimately dependent on that of the Kidneys. This is reflected in the statement that the Kidneys dominate the yang of the whole body and govern water'. When Kidney yang fails to move the body fluids there may be oedema with difficult urination. The Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas says "Shènshū BL-23 treats the hundred oedematous diseases" (i.e. any kind of oedema).

The uterus depends on the Kidney essence for its growth, maturation and nourishment, the Penetrating and Conception vessels are both nourished by and have their root in the Kidneys, and the Essential Questions says "the vessel of the uterus connects with the Kidneys"40. Shènshū BL-23 is indicated for a variety of disorders of the uterus including irregular menstruation due to Kidney deficiency, chronic cold of the uterus giving rise to taxation, 'emaciation in women due to sexual intercourse during menstruation' and leucorrhoea.

The intimate relationship between the Kidney yang and ming men (the gate of life) has been emphasised in numerous classics. According to the Classic of Difficulties41 "On the left is the Kidney, on the right is ming men", whilst Li Dong-yuan wrote "The dynamic qi that moves between the Kidneys is ming men". Zhang Jing-yue of the Ming dynasty stated "ming men resides between the Kidneys" and "ming men is the root of original qi and the residence of the water and fire; without it the yin qi of the five zang is unable to grow, the yang qi of the five zang is unable to develop". The Kidney yang therefore corresponds to ming men fire and is the source of the fire of the whole body. Failure of Kidney yang to warm the body leads to such symptoms as chronic cold of the uterus, lumbar region, legs and bones. Decline of the Kidney yang and waning of ming men fire may lead to weakness of the sexual function and hence impotence. Kidney yang is also the source of Spleen yang. When Kidney yang is unable to warm Spleen and Stomach earth there may be chronic diarrhoea due to cold or dampness, diarrhoea containing undigested food, cold and distention of the Stomach, and cold vomiting. The diarrhoea associated with this pattern characteristically occurs in the early hours of the morning and is known as fifth-watch (cockcrow) diarrhoea. The Complete Works of Jing-yue stated "The opening and closing of the two excretions is dominated by the Kidneys. When the yang qi of the Kidneys is insufficient, then ming men is in decline and yin cold is in abundance; therefore after the fifth watch when the yang qi of the Kidneys is in decline and the yin qi is reaching its zenith there will be ceaseless diarrhoea".

According to the Complete Works of Jing-yue "The Lung is the master of qi, the Kidneys are the root of qi. The Lung dominates the exhalation of qi whilst the Kidneys dominate the reception of qi. Only when yin and yang are mutually communicating is respiration harmonious". This quotation emphasises the essential role of the Kidneys in normal respiration. The Lung is the uppermost zang with the function of descending the qi and controlling exhalation, whilst the Kidneys are the bottomost zang with the function of grasping the qi and controlling inhalation. If Kidney qi is deficient and unable to grasp and hold the Lung qi there may be dyspnoea, asthma or cough. This pattern is characterised by its chronic nature and is usually seen with other accompanying signs of Kidney deficiency. As is the case with Kidney qi not firm, this pattern may be seen either without symptoms of cold or heat, or in the context of deficiency of either Kidney yang or Kidney yin.

According to Essential Readings from the Medical Tradition "The fire and water of the human body is yin and yang ... without yang, yin cannot engender; without yin, yang cannot transform" whilst in the Complete Works of Jing-yue it is said "yin and yang are of the same origin...fire is the ruler of water, water is the source of fire...". These quotations underline the inseparable relationship of the yin and yang of the Kidneys and help explain why all acupuncture points which treat the Kidneys invariably benefit both Kidney yin and Kidney yang. Although the indications for Shènshū BL-23 emphasise deficiency of Kidney qi or Kidney yang, therefore, it also has an action on nourishing Kidney yin.

Like Kidney yang, Kidney yin is the root of the yin of the whole body. Kidney yin deficiency may lead to impaired nourishment of the body and the flaring up of deficiency fire, giving rise to such symptoms as emaciation, wasting and thirsting disorder, and redness and heat of the face and body.

It is a characteristic of the yin back-shu points that they nourish and regulate their corresponding sense organs. According to the Spiritual Pivot42 "The Kidneys open into the ears; if the Kidneys are in harmony, the ears can hear the five sounds". Since the Kidneys store essence, produce marrow which fills up the brain and dominate yin, Shènshū BL-23 is indicated not only for ear disorders such as tinnitus and deafness, but also for blurred vision, night blindness and visual dizziness, all due to deficiency of marrow, essence or yin.

Since the Kidney yin and yang are the root of the yin fluids and the yang qi of the body, this explains the action of Shènshū BL-23 in diseases of chronic deficiency. It is indicated for the five taxations and the seven injuries, taxation of the five zang, and prolonged accumulation of cold leading to taxation. The five taxations as discussed in the Spiritual Pivot are i. excessive use of the eyes which injures the blood, ii. excessive lying down which injures the qi, iii. excessive sitting which injures the flesh, iv. excessive standing which injures the bones, and v. excessive walking which injures the sinews. In later texts, the concept of the five taxations was also used to refer to taxation of each of the five zang. Although also referring to a range of male genital disorders (see glossary), the seven injuries in this context are i. overeating which injures the Spleen, ii. great anger which injures the Liver, iii. heavy lifting or prolonged sitting on damp ground which injure the Kidneys, iv. pathogenic cold which injures the Lung, v. worry and anxiety which injure the Heart, vi. wind, rain, cold and summer-heat which injure the body, and vii. excessive fear which injures the emotions.

According to the Essential Questions "The Kidneys store the qi of the bone marrow"43, "The Kidneys reside in the lumbar region"44, "The Kidneys generate bone marrow"45 and " ... when there is internal attack, and heat resides in the Kidneys, then the bones will wither and the marrow will be deficient, therefore the legs will not be able to support the body and bone atrophy disorder will develop"46. Any Kidney deficiency pattern may give rise to chronic lumbar pain and weakness or soreness of the knees, whilst in cases of Kidney yin deficiency there may be hot sensations in the bones and in case of Kidney yang deficiency, cold sensations of the bones. Located in the lumbar region and having a direct action on the Kidney zang, Shènshū BL-23 is an essential point in the treatment of any kind of lumbar pain which has its root in Kidney deficiency, as well as Kidney deficient atrophy disorder and hemiplegia.

Finally the Illustrated Supplement to the Classic of Categories states that Shènshū BL-23 is one of five points (Fèishū BL-13, Xīnshū BL-15, Gānshū BL-18, Píshū BL-20 and Shènshū BL-23) which "drain heat from the five zang".

# **KID-21** · Yōumén (幽門) · *Hidden Gate*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
According the Classic of Difficulties28 "When the Penetrating vessel is diseased there is counterflow qi and abdominal urgency". Like many of the Kidney channel points on the abdomen, Yōumén KID-21 (the final point of the Penetrating vessel on the Kidney channel) is indicated for counterflow qi manifesting as nausea, vomiting, retching and cough. The term abdominal urgency refers to a sensation of acute cramping pain, usually associated with dysenteric disorder.

Like the majority of the Penetrating vessel points on the Kidney channel, Yōumén KID-21 is indicated for redness of the eyes originating at the inner canthus. Whilst there is no simple explanation of this symptom, it is worth noting that although some descriptions of the Penetrating vessel suggest that it terminate at the lips, illustrations and other accounts of its pathway usually show it ending at the inner portion of the eyes.

Summary of clinical application
The Classic of Difficulties says "When the Penetrating Vessel is diseased there is counterflow qi and abdominal urgency". This is the terminal point of the Penetrating Vessel on the Kidney channel.
Descends rebellious Lung and Stomach qi: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, vomiting of foamy (watery) saliva, nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, retching, fullness with no desire to eat, difficult ingestion, cough.

# **KID-22** · BÙLÁNG (步廊) · *Walking Corridor*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The points Bùláng KID-22, Shénfēng KID-23, Língxū KID-24, Shéncáng KID-25, Yùzhōng KID-26 and Shūfǔ KID-27 were listed in the Essential Questions as the twelve shu points of the chest. They share the common actions of descending rebellious qi of the Lung and Stomach, and are particularly indicated for wheezing, dyspnoea and coughing due to 'fullness above and deficiency below'. This occurs when the Kidney qi is insufficiently strong to grasp the Lung qi.

# **KID-6** · ZHÀOHǍI (照海) · *Shining Sea*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Zhàohǎi KID-6 is the confluent point and according to a passage in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion also the luo-connecting point of the Yin Motility vessel. The Yin Motility vessel traverses the medial aspect of the leg, the perineum, chest and throat, whilst the Kidney primary channel traverses the abdomen, connects with the uterus, joins with the Heart and ascends along the throat. The action of Zhàohǎi KID-6 can best be understood in relation to three major functions: i. regulating the Yin Motility vessel and the Kidney channel, ii. nourishing yin and clearing deficiency heat from the throat, Heart, intestines, uterus and genitals, and iii. regulating the lower jiao.

In the Ode of the Obstructed River the use of Zhàohǎi KID-6 is referred to as one of the 'eight therapeutic methods'. In this description of the application of the eight confluent points of the extraordinary vessels to affect specific symptoms and areas of the body, Zhàohǎi KID-6 is indicated for throat wind (swelling and pain with difficulty in swallowing). Both the Yin Motility vessel and the Kidney channel pass through the throat. When heat deriving from yin deficiency scorches the throat, there may be swelling, dryness, redness and pain. This type of sore throat is characterised by its chronic and lingering nature, worsening in the evening and with tiredness, and Zhàohǎi KID-6 is the main distal point to treat this pattern. Such is its affinity for the throat region, however (due to its ability to clear and regulate both channels), that it may also be selected for any kind of sore throat, whether deficient or excess. It is also indicated for plumstone qi (globus hystericus), a sensation of throat blockage which worsens or ameliorates according to fluctuations in the emotional state and which is normally associated with stagnation of qi and phlegm.

The Yin Motility vessel connects with the Yang Motility vessel at the eyes at Jīngmíng BL-1, and Zhàohǎi KID-6 is indicated for eye disorders such as redness and pain of the inner canthus and disturbance of the vision by spots and stars. According to the Spiritual Pivot16 "When the [taiyang Bladder] channel enters the brain it is divided into the Yin Motility and the Yang Motility, it is here that the yin and yang meet; yang enters the yin and yin moves outwards to the yang, meeting at the inner corner of the eye. When the yang is abundant, the eyes are staring open; when the yin is abundant, the eyes will be closed shut". This passage has been interpreted to explain the use of Zhàohǎi KID-6 for both insomnia (excessive opening of the eyes) and somnolence (excessive closing of the eyes). Zhàohǎi KID-6 is also classically indicated for night-time epilepsy, and Shēnmài BL-62, the confluent point of the Yang Motility vessel, is indicated for day-time epilepsy.

The Kidney primary channel enters the Heart which stores the spirit, whilst the Kidneys store the will. When the Kidneys and the Heart function harmoniously, the spirit and the will mutually support each other. As well as being able to treat epilepsy and sleeping disorders, Zhàohǎi KID-6 is used to restore communication between the Heart and Kidneys, especially when heat deriving from Kidney yin deficiency disrupts the spirit and gives rise to a variety of mental and emotional symptoms such as sadness, fright, insomnia and nightmares.

In the lower jiao Zhàohǎi KID-6 regulates the functions of the uterus, genitals and the two lower yin (anus and urethra). Its forte is to nourish yin and clear deficiency heat, but like many points of the Kidney channel it is also able to tonify yang and warm cold.

According to the Essential Questions17 "the vessel of the uterus connects with the Kidneys". The Kidneys dominate sexual development and are the origin of the Conception and Penetrating vessels, and normal functioning of the uterus depends in the first instance on a harmonious Kidney function. Zhàohǎi KID-6 is indicated for a wide variety of disorders of menstruation (irregular menstruation, amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea), fertility (chronic cold of the uterus leading to infertility) and childbirth (difficult labour, persistent flow of lochia, post-partum dizziness and pain).

In the treatment of genital disorders, Zhàohǎi KID-6 is predominantly indicated in heat patterns manifesting as genital itching, sudden involuntary erection, leucorrhoea and seminal emission. In the treatment of urinary disorders Zhàohǎi KID-6 is indicated for frequent or dribbling urination, enuresis and oedema, all manifestations of deficiency of Kidney qi or Kidney yang. Wang Tao of the Tang dynasty in Secrets of a Frontier Official specifically mentioned the use of this point in the treatment of dribbling urination in women.

Another important indication for Zhàohǎi KID-6 is constipation. Due to its properties of nourishing the Kidneys and clearing deficiency heat it is predominantly indicated for constipation due either to deficiency of yin or scorching of body fluids from prolonged heat in the intestines. Its frequent inclusion in classical combinations, however, reveal that it has long been considered an important distal point for any kind of constipation.

Finally Zhàohǎi KID-6 treats disorders along the course of the Kidney channel and the Yin Motility vessel, such as tightness and contraction of the inner aspect of the leg (a traditional indication of disorder of the Yin Motility vessel) and distention and fullness of the chest and abdomen.

# **KID-9** · ZHÚBĪN (築賓) · *Guest House*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Zhúbīn KID-9 is the xi-cleft point of the Yin Linking vessel which connects the yin channels of both hand and foot and the Conception vessel. The Yin Linking vessel has a special action on the Heart, thus the Classic of Difficulties24 says "When the Yin Linking vessel is diseased, Heart pain will result”. The traditional indications of this point do not include Heart pain, but they do clearly reveal a pattern of phlegm or phlegm-fire obstructing the Heart giving rise to madness, mania, mania depression disorder, raving, fury and cursing and vomiting of foamy (watery) saliva. Phlegm and qi coagulating in the neck region give rise to goitre, whilst tongue thrusting (where the tongue is repeatedly thrust out of the mouth like a snake's tongue) may be due to accumulated heat of the Heart and Spleen.

Summary of clinical application
Clears the Heart and resolves phlegm: madness, mania, mania depression disorder, raving, fury and cursing, vomiting of foamy (watery) saliva, goitre.
Also indicated for shan disorder, umbilical shan disorder in infants, pain of the medial aspect of the leg, contraction of the calf muscle, weakness of the legs.
