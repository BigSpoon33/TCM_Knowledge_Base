# **LIV-13** · ZHĀNGMÉN (章門) · *Completion Gate*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Zhāngmén LIV-13, located midway between the middle and lower jiao, is both a point of the Liver channel and the front-mu point of the Spleen. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body. Zhāngmén LIV-13 is therefore an important point to harmonise the relationship both between the Liver and Spleen, and between the middle and lower jiao, with the emphasis on disorders of the abdomen and intestines.

According to Standards of Patterns and Treatments "The essence of the five zang is all transported from the Spleen". As the origin of the post-natal qi, the Spleen and Stomach are considered to play a central role among the zangfu, transforming and distributing the essence of food and drink throughout the body. For this reason, the Spleen may be said to dominate the zang and the Stomach the fu. The close relationship of Zhāngmén LIV-13 to the Spleen, therefore, is further reflected in its status as the hui-meeting point of the zang, in the same way that Zhōngwǎn REN-12, the front-mu point of the Stomach, is also the hui-meeting point of the fu.

The Liver tends to excess patterns and the Spleen to deficiency. Liver-Spleen disharmony may originate either from the Liver, when qi stagnation aggressively invades, obstructs and suppresses the transportation and transformation function of the Spleen, or from the Spleen, when Spleen qi deficiency is unable to resist the encroachment of exuberant Liver qi. This process is reflected in the saying "Anger is hard and the zangfu are soft; what is hard easily injures what is soft" and by Zhang Jing-yue's observation "If anger occurs during or after eating it injures the Stomach and Spleen" 17. The origin of Liver-Spleen disharmony, therefore, may be either an excess condition of the Liver or a deficient condition of the Spleen, or a combination of the two. One characteristic of this disharmony is the fluctuation in severity of symptoms with changes in the emotional state, and the tendency for either Liver qi stagnation or Spleen deficiency to predominate at different times. Zhāngmén LIV-13, which is able both to regulate the Liver qi and to tonify the Spleen, is the main point on the abdomen to treat all gradations of Liver-Spleen disharmony giving rise to symptoms such as propensity to anger, distention and pain of the abdomen, borborygmus, diarrhoea and loss of appetite. Diarrhoea due to Liver-Spleen disharmony is distinguished by two main characteristics. The first is that the diarrhoea is often preceded by distention and pain, both of which are relieved after passing stools. The second is that the diarrhoea frequently alternates with constipation, for which this point is also indicated. This pattern is frequently encountered in irritable bowel syndrome and premenstrual bowel disorders.

Zhāngmén LIV-13 may also be used for Spleen disharmony without Liver complications, or Liver disharmony without Spleen complications. Through its action of fortifying the Spleen, it is indicated for weariness of the limbs, emaciation, injury to the Stomach and Spleen from overindulgence in eating, and diarrhoea containing undigested food. By resolving Liver qi stagnation it is able to treat oesophageal constriction, fullness of the chest, focal distention, pain of the lateral costal region and constipation. If Liver qi stagnation leads to stasis of blood, there may be abdominal masses and (in terms of western medicine) enlargement of the liver and/or spleen. If Liver qi stagnation transforms to fire, there may be agitation and heat with a dry mouth, mad walking and propensity to anger. If the Liver is deficient, there will be propensity to fear. If Liver qi invades the Stomach or Lung, and impairs their descending function, there will be vomiting, cough or dyspnoea. Through its dual action on the Liver and Spleen, Zhāngmén LIV-13 is also able to drain dampness or damp-heat from the middle and lower jiao with such symptoms as jaundice and frequent urination with turbid white discharge.

The Liver channel is interiorly-exteriorly coupled with the Gall Bladder channel which controls the sides of the body and facilitates turning and bending. Zhāngmén LIV-13, a meeting point of the Liver and Gall Bladder channels, is located close to the waist and lumbar region and is indicated for rigidity of the spine, lumbar pain and inability to turn and bend the waist. The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion recommends Zhāngmén LIV-13 for cold and pain of the lumbar spine, whilst Sun Si-miao in the Thousand Ducat Formulas is more specific and recommends it for cold and painful lumbar spine in men.

Finally, Zhāngmén LIV-13 is indicated for the pattern of running piglet qi arising from severe stagnation of qi. According to the Essentials From the Golden Cabinet "Running piglet disorder arises from the lower abdomen; it rushes up to the throat with such ferocity that the patient feels he is close to death. It attacks and then remits. It is brought about by fear and fright". Running piglet qi primarily arises when stagnant Liver qi transforms to heat, or when Kidney yang deficiency leads to accumulation of cold in the lower jiao. In both cases, qi is violently discharged and rushes upwards along the Penetrating vessel. In clinical practice, running piglet qi may be encountered in a number of variants, all involving a rushing sensation, usually upwards, along the trunk, back or limbs. It is usually accompanied by feelings of intense anxiety.

# **LIV-14** · Qímén (期門) · *Cycle Gate*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Qímén LIV-14 is the last point on the Liver channel and indeed the last point in the great circulation of qi which begins at Zhōngfǔ LU-1 and passes through all the twelve channels, ending one complete cycle at this point. This is reflected in its name 'Cycle Gate'.

Qímén LIV-14 is the front-mu point of the Liver. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body. It is in the region of this point that the Liver channel spreads through the lateral costal region, diaphragm and chest. Its main sphere of action therefore is on regulating the free flow of qi in these areas, and in contrast to Zhāngmén LIV-13 which focuses on the middle and lower jiao, Qímén LIV-14 acts primarily on the middle and upper jiao.

The Spiritual Pivot 18 states "With anger the qi rebels upwards and accumulates in the chest". If Liver qi is obstructed in the chest or lateral costal region, there will be pain, distention or fullness, whilst if Liver qi invades the Lung and obstructs its descending function, it will give rise to cough, sighing and dyspnoea. The Liver sinew channel links with the breast, and the entire breast region is strongly influenced by the Liver. If Liver qi is obstructed in the breast region, therefore, there will be pain, distention and even masses, all of which may fluctuate with the menstrual cycle, being most pronounced in the days immediately prior to menstruation. Qímén LIV-14 is an important adjacent point in the treatment of this common condition.

The intimate relationship between qi and blood is clearly expressed in the saying "Qi is the commander of blood ... when qi moves, blood moves". Severe or prolonged qi stagnation, therefore, will lead to blood stasis manifesting as hardness or masses with cutting pain in the chest, lateral costal region, abdomen or hypogastrium. Qímén LIV-14, by virtue of its ability to circulate both qi and blood, is indicated in all these situations. Qímén LIV-14 is also specifically indicated for cutting or stabbing pain of the Heart, reflecting its status as a meeting point of the Liver channel with the Yin Linking vessel. According to the Classic of Difficulties 19 "When the Yin Linking vessel is diseased, Heart pain will result".

According to Zhang Jing-yue "If anger occurs during or after eating it injures the Stomach and Spleen" 17. This vital observation emphasises the great importance ascribed to a peaceful and harmonious state of mind during mealtimes. If instead there is disturbance, conflict, frustration, resentment or outright anger they may wreak turmoil in the digestive system. If Liver qi transversely invades the Stomach in this way and impairs its descending function, the Stomach qi will stagnate or rebel upwards leading to epigastric distention and pain, acid regurgitation, vomiting and hiccup. Qímén LIV-14 is an essential local point in the treatment of this pattern of Liver-Stomach disharmony. If Liver qi transversely invades the Spleen and impairs the Spleen transportation and transformation function, there will be abdominal distention and diarrhoea, although Qímén LIV-14 is less used clinically in this situation than Zhāngmén LIV-13.

A specific indication for Qímén LIV-14 is 'injury by cold leading to heat which enters the blood chamber'. This refers to attack and penetration of cold during menstruation or after childbirth. The cold transforms to heat and gives rise to alternating fever and chills, hardness and fullness in the lower abdomen, chest and lateral costal region, and clear consciousness during the day with disordered speech at night. This pattern was first described in the Treatise on Injury by Cold by Zhang Zhong-jing who recommended the administration of Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) and needling Qímén LIV-14, especially in the case of manic raving. The Tang dynasty author Xu Xue-shi, a scholar of the works of Zhang Zhong-jing, in his discussion of the Treatise on Injury by Cold said "Concerning heat entering the blood chamber in women, when Xiao Chai Hu Tang is too slow, needle Qímén LIV-14". Qímén LIV-14 is also indicated for uterine bleeding.

Finally, like Zhāngmén LIV-13, Qímén LIV-14 is an important point in the treatment of running piglet qi (see Zhāngmén LIV-13 for a fuller discussion).
