# **REN-1** · HUÌYĪN (會陰) · *Meeting of Yin*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Huìyīn REN-1 (Meeting of Yin) derives its name from its location in the area between the anus and the external genitalia (the two lower yin) and the fact that the perineum is where the Conception and Penetrating vessels meet (with the Governing vessel). It is also directly beneath and opposite to Bǎihuì DU-20 (the point at which all the yang gathers) and hence the deep, dark, hidden and protected place where yin meets. This is reflected in the importance of Huìyīn REN-1 in qigong practice. In the practice of small heavenly circuit rotation, qi is focused in the lower dantian (cinnabar field), directed to Huìyīn REN-1 and then to Chángqiáng DU-1 before being directed up the Governing vessel to Bǎihuì DU-20 and then down the Conception vessel to return to the lower dantian.

Historically there has been some discussion as to whether Huìyīn REN-1 rather than Jiūwéi REN-15 is the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel. The Spiritual Pivot 3 refers to the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel as Weiyi (Tail Screen), an alternative name for Jiūwéi REN-15, and gives symptoms of excess (pain of the skin of the abdomen) and deficiency (itching of the skin of the abdomen). Later classics, including both the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion refer to the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel as Pingyi (Flat Screen), an alternative name for Huìyīn REN-1, and ascribe these symptoms of excess and deficiency to this point. Huìyīn REN-1 as the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel would reflect a neat symmetry with Chángqiáng DU-1 as the luo-connecting point of the Governing vessel.

Huìyīn REN-1 has a strong action on the genito-urinary and anal regions, especially in disorders due to damp-heat, and is indicated for genital pain and swelling, as well as recalcitrant urinary disorders. It is unfortunate that due to its location it is clinically less used than it otherwise might be.

Huìyīn REN-1, under its alternative name of Guicang (Ghost Store) is one of the 'thirteen ghost points' of Sun Si-miao, used in the treatment of epilepsy and mania disorder. The Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas in fact specified that in men Yinxiafeng (Extra) should be needled, whilst in women Yumentou (Extra), located at the posterior labial commissure, should be needled. Both points more or less correspond to Huìyīn REN-1.

Finally, Huìyīn REN-1 is indicated (for example in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion) for reviving from drowning and is said to have the ability to promote the expulsion of water from the lungs.

# **REN-10** · XIÀWǍN (下脘) · *Lower Cavity*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Xiàwǎn REN-10 (Lower Cavity) is also known as Xiaguan (Lower Controller). This point was traditionally considered to affect the lower portion of the Stomach, whilst Shàngwǎn REN-13 (Upper Cavity) was considered to affect its upper portion. Between these two points lies Zhōngwǎn REN-12 (Middle Cavity). The Spiritual Pivot 17 states "When there is difficult ingestion and obstruction in the diaphragm, this indicates the pathogen is in the Stomach. When the disorder is in the upper cavity, then needle Shàngwǎn REN-13 to restrain the rebellion and descend it. When the disorder is in the lower cavity, then needle Xiàwǎn REN-10 to scatter and move it". The Song More Precious Than Jade says "when the Stomach is cold, Xiàwǎn REN-10 is excellent" whilst the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion states " Xiàwǎn REN-10 is the main point to use when food and drink are not digested and regurgitated after ingestion".

The principal use of this point is in cases of food stagnation with such symptoms as abdominal fullness, epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting after eating, lack of appetite, and undigested food in the stools.

Summary of clinical application
For food stagnation: “When there is difficult ingestion and obstruction in the diaphragm, this indicates the pathogen is in the Stomach ... when the disorder is in the lower cavity, then needle Xiawan REN-10 to scatter and move it” (Spiritual Pivot). For abdominal fullness, epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting after eating, lack of appetite, undigested food in the stools.

# **REN-12** · ZHŌNGWǍN (中脘) · *Middle Cavity*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Zhōngwǎn REN-12 (Middle Cavity), also known as Zhongguan (Middle Controller), is the front-mu point of the Stomach and the hui-meeting point of the fu. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers on the anterior surface of the body. As the origin of the post-heaven qi, the Stomach and Spleen are considered to play a central role among the zangfu, transforming and distributing the essence of food and drink throughout the body. For this reason, the Stomach may be said to dominate the fu and the Spleen the zang. The close relationship of Zhōngwǎn REN-12 to the Stomach, therefore, is further reflected in its status as the hui-meeting point of the fu, in the same way that Zhāngmén LIV-13, the front-mu point of the Spleen, is also the hui-meeting point of the zang.

Zhōngwǎn REN-12 is the principal point on the abdomen to regulate the function of the Stomach. The Investigation into Points Along the Channels simply states that Zhōngwǎn REN-12 can treat "all diseases of the Stomach and Spleen". In comparison with neighbouring points such as Liángmén ST-21, Shàngwǎn REN-13 and Xiàwǎn REN-10 which are predominantly indicated in excess patterns, Zhōngwǎn REN-12 is equally applicable in disorders characterised by either excess or deficiency.

The Stomach is the 'sea of water and grain' and its principal functions are to receive food and drink, 'rot and ripen' them and then descend these transformed products. Disorders of the Stomach may be deficient or excess in nature, due to cold or heat, exterior pathogens or interior disharmony. Whatever the aetiology, disharmony of the Stomach will always manifest in disturbance of one or more of these functions. If the Stomach fails to receive food and drink, there will be inability to eat and difficult ingestion; if the Stomach fails to 'rot and ripen' and to descend there will be fullness, distention and pain; if the Stomach qi rebels upwards there will be nausea, vomiting, Stomach reflux and hiccup.

Traditional Chinese methods of health preservation have long recognised the importance of emotional harmony in the smooth functioning of the Stomach. The constant dissipation of qi resulting from worry, anxiety and overthinking may deplete the Stomach and Spleen and impair the function of the Stomach. Excess of any of the seven emotions may result in stagnation of qi which then injures the Stomach leading to epigastric pain. Most injurious of all the emotions are anger, frustration or resentment, particularly if experienced whilst eating. At this time the qi is focused on the Stomach, rendering it particularly susceptible to qi stagnation. In all these cases Zhōngwǎn REN-12 is a primary point. In practice, epigastric pain or distention deriving from Liver qi stagnation may be accompanied by pain or distention of the lateral costal region. Not only is Zhōngwǎn REN-12 indicated for this symptom, but the needling sensation from Zhōngwǎn REN-12 commonly transmits to this area.

The Stomach and Spleen are intimately related. According to the Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach by Li Dong-yuan "when Stomach deficiency gives rise to failure of the taiyin to receive [what is naturally due it], the foot yangming mu point [ Zhōngwǎn REN-12] will lead it through". This highlights the important secondary action of Zhōngwǎn REN-12 in strengthening the Spleen in cases of deficiency. It is indicated for diarrhoea, undigested food (in the stool), deficiency-taxation, post-partum dizziness and sallow complexion.

Finally Zhōngwǎn REN-12 is cited in the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc.

# **REN-13** · SHÀNGWǍN (上脘) · *Upper Cavity*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Shàngwǎn REN-13 (Upper Cavity) is also known as Shangguan (Upper Controller). This point was traditionally considered to affect the upper portion of the Stomach whilst Xiàwǎn REN-10 (Lower Cavity) was considered to affect its lower portion. Between these two points lies Zhōngwǎn REN-12 (Middle Cavity). The Spiritual Pivot 18 states "When there is difficult ingestion and obstruction in the diaphragm, this indicates the pathogen is in the Stomach. When the disorder is in the upper cavity, then needle Shàngwǎn REN-13 to restrain the rebellion and descend it. When the disorder is in the lower cavity, then needle Xiàwǎn REN-10 to scatter and move it". Shàngwǎn REN-13 is indicated for rebellion of Stomach qi manifesting as nausea, vomiting, vomiting of blood and Stomach reflux and for stagnation in the epigastrium and abdomen manifesting as pain, distention, fullness and masses.

The Conception vessel ascends through the middle of the chest, whilst Shàngwǎn REN-13 is a meeting point of the Conception vessel with the Stomach and Small Intestine channels, both of which connect with the Heart via their primary or secondary pathways. Shàngwǎn REN-13 is indicated (and included in classical combinations) for heat, agitation and pain of the Heart and palpitations. In clinical practice however, Jùguè REN-14, the next point along the channel and the front-mu point of the Heart, is more commonly used for such Heart disorders.

Summary of clinical application
“When there is difficult ingestion and obstruction in the diaphragm, this indicates the pathogen is in the Stomach. When the disorder is in the upper cavity, then needle Shangwan REN-13 to restrain the rebellion and descend it” (Spiritual Pivot): treats rebellion of Stomach qi (nausea, vomiting, vomiting of blood, Stomach reflux) and stagnation in the epigastrium and abdomen (pain, distention, fullness and masses).
For, heat, agitation and pain of the Heart and palpitations.

# **REN-14** · JÙQUÈ (巨闕) · *Great Gateway*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
According to the Essential Questions the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates, and Jùquè REN-14, the front-mu point of the Heart, is indicated for disorders both of the Heart zang and of the spirit. The Introduction to Medicine by Li Ting of the Ming dynasty states that Jùquè REN-14 treats the "nine types of Heart pain". According to the principles "without movement there is pain" and "where there is malnourishment there is pain", Heart pain always involves either stagnation of qi and blood or deficiency of qi, blood, yin or yang. In clinical practice such excess and deficiency patterns often combine, and even when the manifestation is excess (for example blood stasis or obstruction of blood by phlegm), the root may involve deficiency. Whatever the aetiology or pattern, as the front-mu point of the Heart Jùquè REN-14 is the principal local point for these disorders, particularly, according to many classical sources, when cold attacks the Heart. It is also indicated for chest pain, especially when it radiates to the back, a symptom of what is known as chest painful obstruction. This disorder, characterised by stasis of phlegm and blood and impaired circulation of yang qi, may also disrupt the function of the Lung resulting in cough and shortness of breath.

Any disharmony of the Heart may give rise to disturbance of the spirit, but the most serious occurs when phlegm obscures the portals of the Heart. In the context of the traditional indications for Jùquè REN-14, when phlegm alone predominates there may be poor memory, disorientation, loss of consciousness or epilepsy with vomiting of foam, whilst if phlegm combines with heat there will be various manifestations of mania disorder such as ranting and raving, great anger and fury, a tendency to curse and scold others etc. Alternatively, if i. Heart blood is deficient, ii. blood stasis hinders the proper nourishment of the Heart by fresh blood, or iii. either Heart yin deficiency or the transformation of blood stasis generate heat which agitates the spirit, there may be anxiety, palpitations and a nervous, agitated sensation in the pit of the epigastrium (below the Heart). Jùquè REN-14 is the principal local point for the treatment of these disorders.

The main pathway of the Conception vessel ascends from the perineum to the region of the mouth. Notwithstanding this upward movement of the channel, the points of the Conception vessel on the chest and abdomen have a strong action on descending qi, especially of the Lung and Stomach. This downward movement is reflected in the qigong 'small heavenly circuit' practice which ascends the qi through the Governing vessel and descends it through the Conception vessel. Located in the region between the Lung and Stomach, Jùquè REN-14 has a strong action on subduing rebellious qi in these two zangfu.

As far as the Lung is concerned, Jùquè REN-14 is indicated for rebellious qi manifesting as cough and fullness of the chest with shortness of breath. As for the Stomach, Jùquè REN-14 is able to regulate rebellion of qi manifesting as nausea, Stomach reflux, vomiting and acid regurgitation, and stagnation of qi giving rise to abdominal distention, oesophageal constriction, focal distention and obstruction of the diaphragm.

Finally the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion recommends Jùquè REN-14 for mutual overacting of the five phases. This extremely broad indication is usually interpreted as a reflection of the status of the Heart, of which Jùquè REN-14 is the front-mu point, as the sovereign ruler of all the zangfu.

Summary of clinical application
Principal local point for Heart pain: sudden Heart pain, Heart pain due to cold, injury by cold leading to agitation of the Heart.
For chest painful obstruction and accumulation of qi in the Lung: pain of the chest radiating to the back, chest pain radiating to the lateral costal region, accumulation of phlegm in the chest, rebellious qi, cough, fullness of the chest with shortness of breath.
Calms the spirit: mania-disorder, mania-depression, aversion to fire, tendency to curse and scold others, ranting and raving, anger, disorientation, loss of consciousness, epilepsy with vomiting of foam, fright palpitations, poor memory.
Descends Stomach qi: nausea, Stomach reflux, vomiting, acid regurgitation, abdominal distention, oesophageal constriction, obstruction of the diaphragm.

# **REN-15** · JIŪWÉI (鳩尾) · *Turtledove Tail*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Jiūwéi REN-15 is the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel, from where the qi of this channel disperses and spreads down over the abdomen. The name of Jiūwéi REN-15 (Turtledove Tail) reflects the shape of the xiphoid process, likened to the tail of a dove, with the ribs forming the wings. In fact, historically there has been some discussion as to whether Huìyīn REN-1, rather than Jiūwéi REN-15, is the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel. The Spiritual Pivot 19 refers to the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel as Weiyi (Tail Screen), an alternative name for Jiūwéi REN-15, and gives symptoms of excess (pain of the skin of the abdomen) and deficiency (itching of the skin of the abdomen). Later classics, however, including both the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion refer to the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel as Pingyi (Flat Screen), an alternative name for Huìyīn REN-1, and ascribe these symptoms of excess and deficiency to that point. Huìyīn REN-1 rather than Jiūwéi REN-15 as the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel would reflect a neat symmetry with Chángqiáng DU-1 as the luo-connecting point of the Governing vessel.

Like Jùguè REN-14, the front-mu point of the Heart, Jiūwéi REN-15 has a powerful action on calming the spirit in cases of phlegm obscuring the Heart (epilepsy, mania disorder, mad singing and walking and aversion to the sound of people talking), as well as regulating stagnation of qi and blood in the Heart region giving rise to oppression and pain. Also like Jùguè REN-14, Jiūwéi REN-15 is able to regulate and descend Lung qi in cases of wheezing, cough, dyspnoea etc.

In the Spiritual Pivot 20 Jiūwéi REN-15 is listed as the yuan point of the 'gao'. This term, the same gao as in Gāohuāngshū BL-43, refers to the area below the Heart, whilst 'huang' refers to the area above the diaphragm. It is said that when a disease enters the gaohuang it is difficult to cure. Master Zuo-jiu's Tradition of the Spring and Autumn Annals 21 , one of the earliest textual references to acupuncture, describes how when the Prince of Jin was gravely ill, he sent for the famous Doctor Yi Huan. After examining the patient, Doctor Huan declared that the disease had settled in the gaohuang region (between the Heart and the diaphragm) and hence "it cannot be purged, it cannot be reached [by needling], herbs will not penetrate it, there is nothing to be done". Despite the statement by the Spiritual Pivot which implies that the gao originates at Jiūwéi REN-15, this point is not normally understood to treat deep and chronic deficiency diseases, the only relevant indications being 'diminished qi' and 'excessive sexual activity leading to exhaustion in youths'.

Summary of clinical application
Dispels phlegm from the Heart and calms the spirit: epilepsy, mania, mad walking, mad singing, aversion to the sound of people talking, fright palpitations.
Regulates the Heart and Lung: oppressive sensation in the Heart, chest pain, excessive sighing, pain radiating from the Heart to the back, wheezing, dyspnoea, fullness of the chest, cough, coughing blood, diminished qi, rattling sound in the throat.

# **REN-17** · SHĀNZHŌNG (膻中) · *Chest Centre*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Shānzhōng REN-17 is also known as Shangqihai (Upper Sea of Qi) and Danzhong (another name for the Pericardium). These alternative names reflect the status of Shānzhōng REN-17 as both the hui-meeting point of qi and the front-mu point of the Pericardium.
The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body.

According to the Spiritual Pivot 22 Shānzhōng REN-17 is the 'sea of qi' (linking with Dàzhuī DU-14, Yǎmén DU-15 and Rényíng ST-9). This passage states "When the sea of qi is in excess there is fullness in the chest, urgent breathing and a red complexion. When the sea of qi is deficient, there is scanty energy insufficient for speech". These indications reflect the ability of Shānzhōng REN-17 to regulate qi in the chest, as well as to treat breathlessness with inability to speak.

The Spiritual Pivot 23 says that the gathering qi accumulates in the 'upper sea', with its lower pathway flowing down to Qìchōng ST-30 and its upper pathway entering the respiratory passages. Located in the centre of the chest, Shānzhōng REN-17 has a strong effect on the gathering qi which in turn oversees both the Lung functions of dominating qi and controlling respiration and speech, and the Heart function of governing the blood and blood vessels. According to the Illustrated Supplement to The Classic of Categories 24 Shānzhōng REN-17 can treat "all types of uprising qi and dyspnoea". When the Lung fails to descend qi and control respiration, whether due to attack by exterior pathogens or to interior disharmony, there will be various manifestations of accumulation or rebellion of qi such as cough, dyspnoea, wheezing, asthma and fullness and oppression of the chest. Shānzhōng REN-17 is an important local point to relieve such accumulation of qi in the chest and to descend rebellion of Lung qi. When the gathering qi is deficient, then both Lung and Heart qi will be deficient. In the Lung there will be shortness of breath, whilst if the Heart qi fails to move the blood and the blood vessels in the chest, there will be chest painful obstruction and pain of the Heart and chest with fullness and oppression. Shānzhōng REN-17 is one of the primary points to regulate the gathering qi.

The action of Shānzhōng REN-17 on descending rebellion of qi extends to the middle jiao, and it is able to restore harmony to the Stomach in cases of difficult ingestion, acid regurgitation, oesophageal constriction and vomiting.

Located midway between the breasts, Shānzhōng REN-17 is a principal point in the treatment of insufficient lactation. According to Observations of Women by Zhang Jing-yue "Qi and blood in the Conception and Penetrating vessels in women transforms into menstrual blood when it descends, and into milk when it ascends; delayed or insufficient production of milk after delivery is due to deficiency of qi and blood", whilst the book Literati's Care of Parents states "Sobbing, crying, grief, anger or depression lead to obstruction of the milk passage". These two quotations illustrate the two main patterns underlying insufficient lactation, namely i. deficiency of qi, and ii. blood and qi stagnation. In either case, Shānzhōng REN-17 may be used in combination with other suitable points, and is frequently found in combination with Shàozé SI-1 in classical combinations. Similarly, Shānzhōng REN-17 is often used clinically in the treatment of distention and pain of the breast and breast abscess. Where any of these breast disorders is unilateral, the needle at Shānzhōng REN-17 may be directed towards the affected side to induce qi sensation into the breast, whilst if the disorder is bilateral, the needle may be directed first to one side and then to the other.

Summary of clinical application
Descends Lung qi, unbinds the chest and regulates the gathering (zong) qi: shortness of breath with rebellious qi, inability to speak, dyspnoea, wheezing, rattling sound in the throat, cough, asthma, fullness and oppression of the chest and diaphragm, obstruction of the chest, pain of the chest and Heart, chest painful obstruction.
For rebellion of Stomach qi: difficult ingestion, acid regurgitation, oesophageal constriction and vomiting.
Important local point for breast disorders: insufficient lactation, breast abscess, distention and pain of the breast.

# **REN-2** · QŪGǓ (曲骨) · *Crooked Bone*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Qūgǔ REN-2 acts primarily on the genito-urinary regions, being able to treat a variety of urinary, lower abdominal, sexual, genital and gynaecological diseases. Its importance in the treatment of these disorders however, is overshadowed by neighbouring points such as Qìchōng ST-30 and Zhōngjí REN-3

Summary of clinical application
Qugu REN-2 primarily acts on the genito-urinary region, being able to treat a variety of urinary, lower abdominal, sexual, genital and gynaecological diseases: dribbling and hesitant flow of urine, difficult urination, retention of urine due to foetal pressure, enuresis, the five types of painful urinary dysfunction, fullness, distention and pain of the lower abdomen, acute lower abdominal pain, painful shan disorder, impotence, seminal emission, dampness and itching of the scrotum, contraction of the penis, dryness and pain of the genitals, red and white leucorrhoea, irregular menstruation, dysmenorrhoea, deficiency and exhaustion of the five zang, deficiency and weariness with extreme cold.

# **REN-21** · XUÁNJĪ (璇璣) · *Jade Pivot*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The combination of Xuánjī REN-21 and Zúsānlǐ ST-36 has long been considered pre-eminent for treating accumulation of food in the Stomach. Whilst Xuánjī REN-21 shares with many points of the Conception vessel the ability to regulate the Stomach, it is interesting to note the statement in the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries, "Heaven, earth and man are the three powers. Bǎihuì DU-20 ... echoes heaven, Xuánjī REN-21 ... echoes man and Yǒngquǎn KID-1 ... echoes the earth". When this threefold division is applied to the body, heaven corresponds to the upper jiao which absorbs the heavenly qi, earth corresponds to the lower jiao and especially the Kidneys, whilst 'man', lying in-between heaven and earth, corresponds to the middle jiao and hence the Stomach.

The strong descending action of this point extends also to the Lung and it is indicated for rebellion of Lung qi giving rise to cough, wheezing and dyspnoea.

Traditionally indicated for accumulation of food in the Stomach, especially when combined with Zusanli ST-36.
Also pain and fullness of the chest and lateral costal region, cough, rebellious qi, wheezing, dyspnoea with inability to speak, rattling sound in the throat.

# **REN-22** · TIĀNTÚ (天突) · *Heavenly Prominence*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
In common with many points of the Conception vessel, Tiāntú REN-22 has a strong action on descending qi. Located in-between the lungs and below the throat, its principal application is in the treatment of a wide variety of disorders affecting these two areas.

Tiāntú REN-22 has long been recognised as an important point to treat Lung disorders, for example the Essential Questions 25 recommended it for rebellious qi, inability to breathe and shortness of breath. Like other points situated in the uppermost portion of the chest (for example Zhōngfǔ LU-1), Tiāntú REN-22 is principally used to treat excess patterns characterised by upward rebellion of Lung qi, including cough, asthma, sudden dyspnoea, inability to breathe and Lung abscess with purulent bloody coughing.

As far as throat disorders are concerned, Tiāntú REN-22 may be used in virtually any clinical situation, ranging from dryness, cold sensation, swelling and pain, to plumstone qi and severe ulceration which prevents eating. It is also an important point for disorders of the voice including cracked voice, loss of voice and inability to speak. In modern clinical practice, the most common application of this point is in the treatment of wheezing and asthma, especially when accompanied by accumulation of phlegm in the throat.

Tiāntú REN-22 is a meeting point of the Conception vessel with the Yin Linking vessel. The Yin Linking vessel ascends through the chest region and according to the Classic of Difficulties 26 "when the Yin Linking vessel alone is diseased it will cause Heart pain". Tiāntú REN-22 is specifically indicated for obstruction of qi with Heart pain and pain of the Heart and the back.

Finally, Tiāntú REN-22 is one of ten points listed in Chapter 2 of the Spiritual Pivot that have come to be known as Window of Heaven points (for a fuller discussion see Points of the Window of Heaven). It illustrates many of the characteristic actions of these points in its ability to treat goitre, rebellious qi of the Lung and Stomach and sudden onset of disorders (sudden loss of voice).

Summary of clinical application
Important point for rebellion of Lung qi: rebellious qi with cough, asthma, sudden dyspnoea, inability to breathe, abscess of the Lung with purulent bloody coughing, obstruction in the chest, fullness of the chest.
Treats all kinds of disorders of the throat and voice: dryness, cold sensation, swelling and pain of the throat, severe ulceration of the throat which prevents eating, accumulation of phlegm in the throat, cracked voice, loss of voice, inability to speak.
Meeting point with the Yin Linking vessel; “When the Yin Linking vessel alone is diseased it will cause Heart pain” (Classic of Difficulties): obstruction of qi with Heart pain and pain of the Heart and the back.
Window of Heaven point: treats goitre, rebellious qi of the Lung and Stomach and sudden onset of disorders (sudden loss of voice).

# **REN-23** · LIÁNQUÁN (廉泉) · *Corner Spring*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Liánquán REN-23, a meeting point of the Conception vessel with the Yin Linking vessel and located at the root of the tongue, is much used clinically in the treatment of loss of voice and stiffness of the tongue following windstroke. Liánquán REN-23 may also be used to regulate the production of fluids in the mouth, either in the case of excess spittle or for dryness of the mouth and thirst. For this purpose the needle is directed alternately towards the extraordinary points Jīnjīn (M-HN-20) and Yùyè (M-HN-20) located below the tongue.

Summary of clinical application
Commonly used in the treatment of loss of voice and stiffness of the tongue following windstroke.
Also to regulate the production of fluids in the mouth, either in the case of excess spittle or for dryness of the mouth and thirst.

# **REN-24** · CHÉNGJIĀNG (承漿) · *Container of Fluids*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Chéngjiāng REN-24 is a meeting point of the Conception vessel with the hand and foot yangming channels (Large Intestine and Stomach). Yangming channel dominates the facial region, Chéngjiāng REN-24 is located just inferior to the mouth and the Conception vessel itself winds around the mouth, connects with the Governing vessel at Yínjiāo DU-28 and terminates below the eye at Chéngqì ST-1. The principal clinical application of Chéngjiāng REN-24, therefore, is in the treatment of facial disorders, especially pain and numbness of the face and deviation of the mouth and eye (i.e. facial paralysis). Facial paralysis may be due either to exterior wind, which attacks and obstructs the channels of the face, or to interior wind which stirs upwards and leads to malnourishment of the channels. These two patterns correspond more or less exactly to peripheral and central nervous system facial paralysis in modern medicine. In the treatment of this disorder, Chéngjiāng REN-24 is usually joined by through-needling to points such as Dìcāng ST-4 or Jiáchē ST-6. The ability of Chéngjiāng REN-24 to extinguish wind, especially in the region of the face and jaw, extends to the treatment of hemiplegia, lockjaw and epilepsy.

As its name 'Contain Fluid' implies, Chéngjiāng REN-24 is able to affect the production of fluids in the mouth and is indicated for excessive production of watery saliva, dry mouth and wasting and thirsting disorder with great desire to drink.

Chéngjiāng REN-24 is a meeting point of the Conception and Governing vessels and lies directly opposite the neck which is traversed by the Governing vessel. A number of classics, for example the Ode of the Essentials of Understanding, recommend it for stiffness and pain of the nape of the neck.

As the terminal point of the Conception vessel, Chéngjiāng REN-24 is indicated for disorders of the lower portion of the channel such as dark urination, shan disorder in men and abdominal masses in women. Finally, Chéngjiāng REN-24 was included under its alternative name Guishi (Ghost Market) by Sun Si-miao among his 'thirteen ghost points' for the treatment of epilepsy and mania-depression.

Summary of clinical application

# **REN-3** · ZHŌNGJÍ (中極) · *Centre Pole*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Zhōngjí REN-3 is the front-mu point of the Bladder and a meeting point of the Conception vessel with the Spleen, Liver and Kidney channels. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body. Zhōngjí REN-3 therefore has a direct action on the Bladder fu. Urinary disorders characterised by retention, pain, frequency and urgency of urination may be excess or deficient in nature. Excess patterns include accumulation of dampness or damp-heat and stagnation of qi, and may be complicated by the presence of stones or bleeding. Deficiency patterns primarily involve deficiency of qi and yang. Due to its ability to regulate the qi transformation function of the Bladder, drain dampness and heat, and strengthen the Kidneys, Zhōngjí REN-3 is a primary point in the treatment of a variety of urinary disorders involving any of these disharmonies. In clinical practice however, Zhōngjí REN-3 is favoured for excess patterns, whilst Guānyuán REN-4 is favoured for deficiency patterns. By virtue of its ability to promote smooth urination, Zhōngjí REN-3 is also indicated for oedema.

The ability of Zhōngjí REN-3 to drain dampness and heat extends to the genital region where it is an important point for itching, swelling and pain as well as leucorrhoea and seminal emission. The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion specifically recommends Zhōngjí REN-3 for pain and swelling of the cervix.

The Spleen controls blood, the Liver stores blood, and the Kidneys and the Conception vessel dominate the uterus and conception. Zhōngjí REN-3, as a meeting point of all these channels, is able to regulate the uterus and menstruation and is primarily indicated for excess patterns giving rise to abdominal (zheng jia) masses, irregular or absent menstruation, infertility, and especially retention of the placenta or lochia.

The three leg yin channels of Spleen, Liver and Kidney all pass through and dominate the lower abdomen. As a meeting point of the Conception vessel with these three channels, Zhōngjí REN-3 therefore has a strong action on the lower abdomen as a whole, predominantly in excess patterns involving stagnation and accumulation of cold or heat. It is indicated for masses, shan disorder and severe twisting pain, and both hot and cold sensations in the abdomen.

Zhōngjí REN-3 is also used for the condition known as running piglet qi, particularly when due to Kidney yang deficiency with invasion of cold. According to the Essentials From the Golden Cabinet "Running piglet disorder arises from the lower abdomen; it rushes up to the throat with such ferocity that the patient feels he is close to death. It attacks and then remits. It is brought about by fear and fright".

Finally, Zhōngjí REN-3 is indicated for deficiency of yang qi and lower origin (yuan) deficiency. However, so great are the tonifying properties of Guānyuán REN-4 that in clinical practice this latter point is almost invariably used for this purpose. Like Guānyuán REN-4 also, Zhōngjí REN-3 is indicated for lumbar pain, reflecting the principle of selecting points from the front of the body to treat the back.

# **REN-4** · GUĀNYUÁN (關元) · *Gate of Origin*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Guānyuán REN-4 is one of the principle acupuncture points to promote and foster the original qi, benefit essence, fortify Kidney yang and nourish Kidney yin. As well as Guanyuan (Gate of Origin) several of the numerous different names given to this point reflect its deeply tonifying properties, for example Mingmen (Gate of Life), Huangzhiyuan (Origin of Huang), Xuehai (Sea of Blood), Qihai (Sea of Qi), Dahai (Great Sea) and of course Dantian (Cinnabar Field). According to classical Chinese thought, the lower dantian, located in the lower abdomen and extending from Yīnjiāo REN-7 to Guānyuán REN-4, is the residence of the deepest energies of the body and the source of all movement. According to the Classic of Difficulties 4 "The dynamic qi that moves between the Kidneys is [the basis] of human life, the source of the five zang and six fu, the root of the twelve channels, the door of respiration and the origin of the sanjiao". According to the Discourse into the Origin and Development of Medicine5 "Original qi is distributed to the five zang and forms the essence of the five zang. Where is the place of origin of the original qi? The Daoists believe it is dantian".

Due to its location at the heart of the lower dantian (cinnabar field) and its close relationship with the original qi and hence essence, Guānyuán REN-4 is an indispensable point to tonify and nourish the Kidneys. This action is made abundantly clear by the long list of classical indications which reads like a textbook description of Kidney deficiency. The Kidneys dominate the bones and lumbar region, and Guānyuán REN-4 is indicated for weakness, pain and cold sensations of the lumbar region and legs, especially in the middle-aged and elderly. In severe cases Kidney deficiency may give rise to withered ears, darkness of the complexion and Kidney taxation. According to the Essential Questions 6 "fear depletes the essence". Fear is closely linked to the Kidneys, and prolonged fear may injure and weaken the Kidneys and the essence, whilst Kidney deficiency may render a person prone to deep-seated fear. The powerful effect that fear may have on the body is reflected in classical sources which ascribe even deep-rooted bone ulcers and deficiency consumption to this aetiology. When the Kidneys are deficient and fail to dominate the Bladder there may be urinary frequency or enuresis. In all such cases Guānyuán REN-4 is of fundamental importance. Guānyuán REN-4 is also used for the condition known as running piglet qi, especially when due to Kidney yang deficiency with invasion of cold. According to the Essentials From the Golden Cabinet "Running piglet disorder arises from the lower abdomen; it rushes up to the throat with such ferocity that the patient feels he is close to death. It attacks and then remits. It is brought about by fear and fright". Not only may this pattern be induced by fear, but when the qi rushes upwards in this way it can induce uncontrollable anxiety and panic.

The Spleen controls blood, the Liver stores blood, and the Kidneys and the Conception vessel dominate the uterus and conception. Guānyuán REN-4, also known as Sanjiejiao (Triple Intersection), is a meeting point of the Conception vessel with these three channels and is an essential point to regulate the uterus and promote fertility. When Kidney deficiency leads to deficiency and coldness of what is known as the 'palace of the child' (i.e. the uterus) in women there may be infertility, amenorrhoea and cold leucorrhoea. The importance of this point in assisting conception is reflected in further alternative names, for example Zihu (Infant's Door) and Zigong (Infant's Palace). If deficiency of Kidney fire leads to coldness and weakness of the 'essence gate' in men, there may be seminal emission and impotence.

According to the True Lineage of Medicine 7 "When Kidney origin (yuan) is abundant, then life is long, when Kidney origin (yuan) is in decline, life is short". For this reason, traditional health preservation practitioners in China recommend the regular application of moxibustion to Guānyuán REN-4 in later life.

The strong tonifying and nourishing action of Guānyuán REN-4 is not limited to the Kidneys alone. Since the Kidneys are the root of both the yin and yang of the body, and "the original qi is distributed to the five zang and forms the essence of the five zang", Guānyuán REN-4 may be used in the treatment of any profound deficiency of the zangfu, whether of qi, blood, yin or yang. Thus, for example, when the yin of the Kidneys and Lung is deficient, Guānyuán REN-4 may be used to treat taxation heat, deficiency consumption with cough, tidal fever with coughing of blood, Kidney deficiency dyspnoea, dyspnoea with inability to lie down, and wasting and thirsting disorder. When the Kidney fire fails to provide sufficient heat for the Spleen's transportation and transformation function there may be chronic diarrhoea, incontinence of the stool in the elderly, lethargy, weakness of the four limbs and undigested food (in the stool).

The action of Guānyuán REN-4 is not limited to tonifying deficiency, however. If exterior cold attacks the lower abdomen, and particularly the Liver channel, especially when there is underlying yang deficiency, there may be severe twisting lower abdominal pain radiating to the genitals and sudden painful shan disorder. These symptoms are commonly ascribed to disharmony of the Small Intestine (Small Intestine qi pain), and this is the principal significance of the status of Guānyuán REN-4 as the front-mu point of the Small Intestine.

When damp-heat knots the Bladder there may be various kinds of urinary disorders characterised by frequency, urgency, pain and dark or bloody urination as well as an intense sensation of heat in the hypogastrium. Guānyuán REN-4 may be used to drain these excess pathogenic factors. According to Zhu Dan-xi "When the Kidneys are deficient the Bladder will generate heat", whilst the General Treatise on the Aetiology and Symptomatology of Diseases8 says "Where painful urinary dysfunction is concerned there is Kidney deficiency and Bladder heat". Guānyuán REN-4 is especially indicated when, as is commonly the case, deficiency and excess co-exist and there is underlying Kidney deficiency. Guānyuán REN-4 is also an important point in the treatment of post-partum disorders such as pain and persistent flow of lochia, which are also frequently due to a combination of deficiency and excess.

Finally, due to its powerful ability to restore the yang, Guānyuán REN-4 is used to treat collapse of yang characterised by chills, breathlessness, minute pulse, profuse sweating and unconsciousness. In such cases, Guānyuán REN-4, in combination with Qìhǎi REN-6 and Shénquè REN-8, is treated by continuous indirect moxibustion.

# **REN-5** · SHÍMÉN (石門) · *Stone Gate*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Shímén REN-5 is the front-mu point of the Sanjiao. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body. The Essential Questions says "the Sanjiao is the official in charge of drainage and controls the water passages" 9, the Classic of Difficulties says "the Sanjiao is the pathway of water and grain" 10 and the Classic of Categories states "when the lower jiao is not treated there is water disorder in the bowels and Bladder". Shímén REN-5 is indicated for stagnation of fluids characterised by difficult urination or retention of urine, painful urinary dysfunction and oedema, as well as for diarrhoea, undigested food in the stool and dysenteric disorder.

Shímén REN-5 is also able to regulate qi stagnation and alleviate pain in the lower abdomen and genital region and is strongly indicated in the treatment of conditions such as twisting pain of the lower abdomen, shan disorder with severe periumbilical pain, abdominal distention, and retraction, swelling and pain of the genitals.

In colloquial Chinese a woman who is infertile is known as a 'stone woman', whilst the name Shimen means 'Stone Gate' or 'Stone Door'. An alternative name for this point is Jueyun (Infertility). These names refer to the unique quality classically attributed to this point of inducing infertility. Texts such as the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, the Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man and the Illustrated Supplement to the Classic of Categories all warn that needling this point can make a woman infertile for life. Modern acupuncture texts, however, make no mention of this warning. The effect of Shímén REN-5 on regulating the function of the uterus and adjusting menstruation is further illustrated by its indications for persistent flow of lochia, abdominal masses, uterine bleeding and leucorrhoea.

Finally, although indicated for deficiency-taxation and lower origin (yuan) deficient and cold, compared with its neighbouring points Guānyuán REN-4 and Qìhǎi REN-6, Shímén REN-5 is notable for the absence of indications of deficiency, and is principally indicated for excess patterns.

Summary of clinical application
Moves stagnant fluids and drains damp: difficult urination, retention of urine, painful urinary dysfunction, oedema, diarrhoea, undigested food in the stool, dysenteric disorder.
Regulates qi in the lower jiao: twisting pain of the lower abdomen, shan disorder with severe periumbilical pain, abdominal distention, retraction, swelling and pain of the genitals.
Traditionally thought to induce infertility. Also for persistent flow of lochia, abdominal masses, uterine bleeding, leucorrhoea.

# **REN-6** · QÌHǍI (氣海) · *Sea of Qi*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Qìhǎi REN-6, like Guānyuán REN-4, is also known by the name of 'Dantian' (Cinnabar Field). This reflects its location in the vital centre of the body where the deepest energies are stored and generated, and which plays a pivotal role in the treatment of disease and in Chinese martial arts and qigong practices. (For a fuller discussion of the dantian see the commentary on Guānyuán REN-4).

The name Qihai (Sea of Qi) emphasises the principal difference between Qìhǎi REN-6 and Guānyuán REN-4. Whilst both have a powerful action on tonifying the Kidneys, the forte of Qìhǎi REN-6 is generating qi and yang and it does not share the yin and blood nourishing qualities of Guānyuán REN-4.

According to the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Qìhǎi REN-6 is indicated for deficiency of the original qi and for qi deficiency of all the five zang. In fact the original qi is considered to be the basis for the formation and activity of all the zangfu. This concept is explained in the Classic of Difficulties 11 which states "The dynamic qi that moves between the Kidneys is [the basis] of human life, the source of the five zang and six fu, the root of the twelve channels, the door of respiration and the origin of the sanjiao", and in the Discourse into the Origin and Development of Medicine 12 which says "Original qi is distributed to the five zang and forms the essence of the five zang". Original qi is formed from the combination of pre- and post- heaven qi. In comparison with Zúsānlǐ ST-36 which tonifies the source of post-heaven qi in the Stomach and Spleen, Qìhǎi REN-6 activates and mobilises the pre-heaven qi stored in the Kidneys. It is thus indicated in the widest possible range of disorders involving qi deficiency and exhaustion. By promoting the pre-heaven qi, Qìhǎi REN-6 is able to foster the post-heaven qi of the Stomach and Spleen and is thus indicated for emaciation and feebleness of the muscles and diarrhoea. By warming and firming the Kidney yang, Qìhǎi REN-6 is able to treat impotence, seminal emission, cold illness and dark face. By promoting the central qi, Qìhǎi REN-6 is able to treat prolapse of the rectum and uterus. So strong are its qi and yang restoring properties that it is a vital point for rescuing yang in cases of collapse with a slow and minute pulse. For this purpose strong moxibustion either by moxa stick or by large moxa cones mediated by sliced fresh ginger or aconite cake is administered. Zhu Dan-xi of the Jin-Yuan dynasty describes a case of "yin depletion followed by sudden expiry of yang" with pouring sweat, faint respiration, urinary incontinence and a large irregular and arrhythmic pulse. He applied moxa to Qìhǎi REN-6"with the moxa cones as big as the small finger. When the eighteenth cone was burned up, his right hand was able to move. Another three cones and his lips began to move a little". He also describes a case of violent diarrhoea resulting in loss of consciousness and extremely faint breathing as if on the verge of death. Moxa was performed at Qìhǎi REN-6 without delay13. The ability of Qìhǎi REN-6 to treat disorders of profound deficiency is further reflected in its designation in the Spiritual Pivot 14 as the shu point of the 'huang'. The huang, which refers to the area just above the diaphragm and which also appears in the name of Gāohuāngshū BL-43, implies one of the deepest and most vital regions of the body.

It is important to emphasise that due to its intimate relationship with the qi, Qìhǎi REN-6 is equally important in the treatment of diseases due to qi stagnation affecting the lower jiao. It is indicated for distention and pain of the abdomen, constipation, qi stagnation due to pathogenic cold giving rise to retraction of the testicles, and cold pain of the abdomen. Since "qi is the master of blood" Qìhǎi REN-6 is also indicated for abdominal masses whether due to stagnation of qi or stasis of blood.

By virtue of its dual actions of tonifying and regulating qi, Qìhǎi REN-6 is able to treat a variety of gynaecological disorders. Uterine bleeding, persistent flow of lochia and post-partum bleeding may be due to failure of the qi to hold the blood, and along with irregular menstruation and dysmenorrhoea may also involve blood stasis, either as a sequela of haemorrhage or as a consequence of qi stagnation.

# **REN-9** · SHUǏFĒN (水分) · *Water Separation*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
As its name implies, Shuǐfēn REN-9 (Water Separation) has a strong action on fluid transformation and distribution and is particularly indicated for oedema. According to the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Shuǐfēn REN-9 is located over the Small Intestine which has the function of 'separating the clear from the turbid' and sending fluids to the Bladder and solid dregs to the Large Intestine for excretion. This Small Intestine function is dominated by the Spleen and Kidneys, and Shuǐfēn REN-9 is particularly indicated for yin oedema due to deficiency of the Spleen and/or Kidneys, especially oedema of the abdominal region. Many early texts specify that in the treatment of oedema this point should be treated by moxibustion rather than needling.

Impairment of the function of the intestines may give rise to severe stagnation and, by blocking its descent, cause rebellion of Stomach qi. Shuǐfēn REN-9 is indicated for distention and pain of the abdomen, drum-like swelling and hardness of the abdomen, periumbilical pain rushing up to the chest and Heart causing difficulty in breathing, loss of appetite, acid regurgitation and vomiting.

The action of Shuǐfēn REN-9 in treating these kinds of accumulation of water, qi and food reflects its ability to harmonise the intestinal region and promote smooth circulation rather than to directly tonify the Spleen or Kidneys.

Summary of clinical application
Important point for oedema, especially oedema due to deficiency of the Spleen and/or Kidneys and oedema of the abdominal region.
Treats intestinal stagnation: distention and pain of the abdomen, drum-like swelling and hardness of the abdomen, periumbilical pain rushing up to the chest and Heart causing difficulty in breathing, loss of appetite, acid regurgitation, vomiting.
