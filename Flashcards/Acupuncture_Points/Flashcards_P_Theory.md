# **BL-14** · JUÉYĪNSHŪ (厥陰俞) · *Jueyin Shu*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Juéyīnshū BL-14 is an exception among the back-shu points in that all the others are named after their respective zang or fu. The fact that Juéyīnshū BL-14 is named after the jueyin (Pericardium and Liver) channel emphasises its ability to unbind the chest by invigorating the circulation of qi. When Liver qi stagnates, usually as a result of emotional factors, it frequently binds the qi of the upper jiao giving rise to symptoms such as pain and oppression of the Heart, chest and diaphragm, restlessness, agitation and oppression.

As the back-shu point of the Pericardium, Juéyīnshū BL-14 is not exclusively reserved for chest and Heart disorders due to qi stagnation, but in combination with Xīnshū BL-15 is widely used to regulate the Heart in many kinds of dysfunction.

The descending function of both the Stomach and Lung is assisted by the smooth and unobstructed movement of Liver qi. When Liver qi stagnates and impairs their descent, there may be cough and vomiting respectively.

Summary of clinical application
Back-shu point of the Pericardium (jueyin) which is intimately linked to the Liver (jueyin).
Regulates qi in the chest, Heart and Lung: pain or oppression of the Heart, chest and diaphragm due to accumulation of qi, palpitations, cough, shortness of breath, rebellious qi vomiting.

# **P-3** · QŪZÉ (曲澤) · *Marsh at the Crook*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
In the 3rd century CE, the Treatise on Injury by Cold by Zhang Zhong-jing classified fevers according to their progression through the six channels (taiyang, yangming, shaoyang, taiyin, shaoyin and jueyin). This theory, according to which pathogenic cold attacked and penetrated the body via the skin, dominated Chinese medicine until the early 17th century when the 'wen bing' or 'warm disease' theory was developed (predominantly by Wu You-he, Ye Tian-shi and Wu Ju-tong). The warm disease school placed the emphasis on febrile diseases due to injury by heat which penetrates the body via the nose and mouth, and classified fevers according to four levels of depth: the defensive level (wei), the qi level (qi), the nutritive level (ying) and the blood level (xue). The defensive and qi levels correspond broadly to the taiyang and yangming stages respectively of the Treatise on Injury by Cold. When pathogenic heat penetrates further to the deeper levels of the body, it first enters the nutritive level, scorching the body fluids and the yin and disturbing the Pericardium and spirit, and then enters the blood level, giving rise to reckless bleeding. Qūzé P-3, the water point of the Pericardium fire channel, clears heat and may be needled or bled for heat at the qi level giving rise to high fever, agitation, thirst etc., or for heat which has reached the nutritive and blood levels giving rise to agitation and restlessness, dry mouth and haemorrhage from the Lung and Stomach.

According to the Classic of Difficulties2 the he-sea points treat 'counterflow qi and diarrhoea', whilst the Spiritual Pivot3 says "in disorders of the Stomach and in disorders resulting from irregular eating and drinking, select the he-sea point". These theories are clearly illustrated by Qūzé P-3 which has the functions of harmonising the Stomach and intestines and stopping vomiting and diarrhoea, especially when these are acute and due to pathogenic heat. It is also worth noting that the interior pathway of the Pericardium channel descends through the diaphragm to the lower abdomen, connecting the upper, middle and lower jiao, which helps to explain the powerful action of this point on these disorders. The dual action of Qūzé P-3 in harmonising the Stomach and intestines and clearing pathogenic heat, makes it particularly suitable for treating diseases due to summer-heat (heatstroke or sunstroke) characterised by fever, sweating, vomiting and diarrhoea.

According to the Spiritual Pivot4 "jueyin channel is abundant in blood and limited in qi ... [it is thus suitable to] prick to bleed jueyin and drain blood ...". This theory explains the effect of bleeding Qūzé P-3 on reducing heat in the blood in cases of febrile haemorrhage. Interestingly, one of the two other channels "abundant in blood and limited in qi" according to this passage in the Spiritual Pivot is the taiyang channel, and this may help to explain certain similarities between Qūzé P-3 (the he-sea point of the Pericardium jueyin channel located at the flexure of the elbow) and Wěizhōng BL-40 (the he-sea point of the Bladder taiyang channel located at the flexure of the knee). Both points may be pricked to bleed to clear heat from the blood level, and are used in the treatment of summer-heat stroke and sudden turmoil disorder with heat of the four limbs, ceaseless thirst, vomiting and diarrhoea.

Finally, Qūzé P-3 is also widely used for disorders of the Pericardium channel such as pain of the elbow, arm and hand. It is indicated for tremor of the head, and like its close neighbour Shàohǎi HE-3, for tremor of the hand and arm.

Summary of clinical application
Clears heat from the qi, nutritive and blood levels (high fever, thirst, agitation, restlessness, dry mouth, haemorrhage from the Lung and Stomach).
Clears summer-heat and stops vomiting and diarrhoea: summerheat stroke, dysenteric disorder, sudden turmoil disorder.
For pain of the elbow, arm and hand, tremor of the head and tremor of the hand and arm.
