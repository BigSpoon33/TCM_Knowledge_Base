# **BL-19** · DǍNSHŪ (膽俞) · *Gall bladder Shu*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Dǎnshū BL-19 is the back-shu point of the Gall Bladder fu, where the qi of the Gall Bladder emanates from the interior to the body surface. It is an important point to clear damp-heat from the Gall Bladder and Liver which gives rise to the classic symptoms of jaundice with yellow eyes, vomiting, distention of the lateral costal region and bitter taste in the mouth. Damp-heat in the Gall Bladder and Liver may arise in the following ways: i. stagnation of Liver qi both generates heat and invades the Spleen, suppressing its transportation and transformation function and leading to the formation of dampness, ii. Spleen deficiency leads to failure of its transportation and transformation function and subsequent formation of dampness which either stagnates and ferments over time and transforms to damp-heat or combines with pre-existing Liver stagnant heat, iii. invasion of exterior damp-heat, iv. consumption of contaminated food, or overconsumption of greasy, rich or spicy food and alcohol. In all cases the damp-heat impairs the Gall Bladder function of secreting bile, and whatever the aetiology Dǎnshū BL-19 is indicated.

According to both the Spiritual Pivot27 and the Essential Questions28 "Taiyang is the opening, yangming is the closing and shaoyang is the pivot". In the Treatise on Injury by Cold by Zhang Zhong-jing, shaoyang pattern denotes the stage where the pathogen is 'half-exterior, half-interior'. In other words the pathogenic factor resides between the taiyang (exterior) and yangming (interior) levels and in this sense shaoyang is the pivot or hinge between the exterior and interior. When the pathogenic factor disrupts the Gall Bladder function it gives rise to stagnation of qi, impairment of the Stomach descending function and uprising of Gall Bladder heat. The clinical manifestations of shaoyang pattern include alternating fever and chills, dry throat, blurred vision, bitter taste in the mouth, fullness and distention of the chest and lateral costal region, and vomiting and nausea. All but the first of these symptoms are classical indications for Dǎnshū BL-19.

According to five phase theory, wood is the mother of fire, and disorders of either the Liver or Gall Bladder wood may co-exist with or be transmitted to the Heart which belongs to fire. In the case of the Gall Bladder there are two main patterns of disharmony which may give rise to disturbance of the Heart and the spirit: i. Gall Bladder qi deficiency and ii. Gall Bladder damp-heat combined with Stomach phlegm-heat.

According to the Essential Questions29 "the Gallbladder is the upright official from where judgement emanates". If there is sudden fright, unusual or abrupt noise or shock, or continuous fear and fright, whether in the formative years of childhood or as an adult, the qi of the Gall Bladder will be injured, giving rise to palpitations, restless sleep or insomnia, inability to sleep alone, mental restlessness, susceptibility to timidity and fear, and indecisiveness. The Gall Bladder qi can only be injured, however, when the Heart qi is also weak. This was emphasised both in Achieving Longevity by Guarding the Source, the 17th Century classic by Gong Ting-xin, which said "Susceptibility to fright ... timidity in which the patient fears being apprehended, all result from deficiency of the qi of Heart and Gall Bladder", and the Essential Readings from the Medical Tradition which explained "When the qi of the Heart and Gall Bladder is strong, sudden fright and danger will not cause disease. However, if the qi is deficient, it will be harmful."

In the case of Gall Bladder damp-heat combined with Stomach phlegm-heat, there may be insomnia, palpitations and anxiety accompanied by bitter taste in the mouth, vomiting, and distention and pain of the chest and lateral costal region. In the treatment of both these patterns, Dǎnshū BL-19 forms an important part of the point prescription.

Finally, bilateral Géshū BL-17 and Dǎnshū BL-19 are known as the 'four flowers', indicated for steaming bone taxation fever, deficiency-taxation, tidal fever etc. For a discussion of the history and application of these points see Géshū BL-17.

Summary of clinical application
For Liver and Gall Bladder damp-heat and shaoyang pattern: jaundice, yellow eyes, bitter taste in the mouth, distention and pain of the chest and lateral costal region, nausea, vomiting, dry throat, blurred vision.
Tonifies the Gall Bladder qi and clears Gall Bladder and Stomach heat: fright palpitations with restless sleep, insomnia.
Comprises the ‘four flowers’ with Géshū BL-17 to tonify deficiency and treat fevers: steaming bone taxation fever, deficiency taxation, tidal fever.

# **GB-1** · TÓNGZǏLIÁO (瞳子髎) · *Pupil Crevice*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The Gall Bladder, Gall Bladder divergent and Liver channels connect with the eye, and the Liver zang (interiorly-exteriorly related to the Gall Bladder) opens into the eyes. Tóngzǐliáo GB-1, the first point of the channel and located just lateral to the eye, is used to treat all kinds of eye disorders, especially when due to Liver channel wind-heat. Whilst eye disorders may be due to exterior wind-heat or interior Liver fire, in clinical practice these two patterns are commonly mixed, and a person who suffers from interior Liver fire or Liver yang is prone to attacks of exterior wind or wind-heat. This commonly-seen clinical situation is often referred to as Liver channel wind-heat.

Tóngzǐliáo GB-1 is traditionally indicated for pain, swelling, redness and itching of the eyes, lacrimation and disorders of vision, and in modern times for such disorders as glaucoma, photophobia, cataract, nebula, corneal opacity, keratitis, retinal haemorrhage and atrophy of the optic nerve. It is also commonly used for temporal headache and supraorbital pain, especially due to the above aetiologies, as well as for deviation of the mouth and eye due to exterior or interior wind. Interestingly Tóngzǐliáo GB-1 is included with Shàozé SI-1 in a classical prescription for breast pain in women. This reflects the pathway of the Gall Bladder sinew channel to the breast.

Summary of clinical application
Treats eye disorders especially due to Liver channel wind-heat (a combination of interior Liver fire or Liver yang and attack of exterior wind or wind-heat): pain, swelling, redness and itching of the eyes, lacrimation, disorders of vision (and glaucoma, photophobia, retinal haemorrhage, atrophy of the optic nerve).
For temporal headache and supraorbital pain.

# **GB-10** · FÚBÁI (浮白) · *Floating White*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The points Fúbái GB-10, Tóuqiàoyīn GB-11 and to a certain extent Tiānchōng GB-9, have certain comparable indications and these are not dissimilar to the indications for the points of the Window of Heaven. All are indicated for goitre, and Fúbái GB-10additionally for stiffness, swelling and pain of the neck. Both Fúbái GB-10 (headache, toothache, deafness and tinnitus) and Tóuqiàoyīn GB-11 (headache and eye, ear, tongue and mouth disorders) are indicated for disorders of the head and sense organs and for rebellion of Lung qi characterised by cough. Both also treat disorders of the lower body, Fúbái GB-10 for flaccidity of the legs with inability to walk, and Tóuqiàoyīn GB-11 for contraction of the sinews of the four limbs, bone consumption, and agitation and heat of the hands and feet. This latter application reflects the principle expounded in the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic1 "When the disease is below select [points] from above".

Summary of clinical application
Rarely used.
Headache, heaviness of the head, chills and fever, toothache, deafness, tinnitus.
Stiffness and pain of the neck, goitre, swelling and pain of the neck, throat painful obstruction.
Fullness of the chest with dyspnoea, chest pain, cough with expectoration of phlegm and foam.

# **GB-11** · TÓUQIÀOYĪN (頭竅陰) · *Yin Portals of the Head*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The name of Tóuqiàoyīn GB-11 (Yin Portals of the Head) is said to refer to its ability to treat diseases of the sense organs associated with the five zang, namely the eyes (Liver), ears (Kidneys), tongue (Heart), mouth (Spleen) and nose (Lung). In fact, classical indications appear for all of these except the nose. In this respect, Tóuqiàoyīn GB-11 in the upper body mirrors Zúqiàoyīn GB-44 (Yin Portals of the Foot) in the lower body. For further discussion of Tóuqiàoyīn GB-11 see Fúbái GB-10.

Summary of clinical application
Rarely used.
Headache, dizziness, eye pain, ear pain, tinnitus, deafness, stiff tongue, bleeding from the root of the tongue, nauseating bitter taste in the mouth.
Stiffness and pain of the neck, goitre, throat painful obstruction.
Pain of the lateral costal region, cough, absence of sweating, contraction of the sinews of the four limbs, bone taxation, agitation and heat of the hands and feet.

# **GB-12** · WÁNGǓ (完骨) · *Mastoid Process*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Wángǔ GB-12 is able to benefit the head region and eliminate both exterior and interior wind. It is indicated for i. headache and head wind, especially when there is pain behind the ear, ii. stiffness and pain of the neck, and iii. heat, pain and swelling affecting the teeth, cheek, ear and throat.

Like many points in the neck region, Wángǔ GB-12 is also able to regulate disharmony between the head and the body. When interior wind stirs and rushes up to the head there may be hemiplegia, deviation of the mouth and eyes, shaking of the head and clenched jaw. At the same time as pathogenic wind rushes up to the head, there may be deficiency in the lower part of the body manifesting as atrophy disorder and weakness and flaccidity of the four limbs. This latter application reflects the principle expounded in the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic2 "When the disease is below select [points] from above".

Another important action of Wángǔ GB-12 is to regulate and calm the spirit, and it is indicated in such disorders as mania, agitation of the Heart and insomnia. This is reflected in its close proximity to the extra point Ānmián N-HN-54 'Peaceful Sleep', located just posterior and slightly superior to Wángǔ GB-12, which is much used for insomnia.

Summary of clinical application
For fullness above: headache (especially when there is pain behind the ear), stiffness and pain of the neck, deviation of the mouth and eyes, shaking of the head, clenched jaw, heat, pain and swelling affecting the teeth, cheek, ear and throat.
For deficiency below: atrophy disorder, weakness and flaccidity of the four limbs.
Calms the spirit: mania, insomnia, agitation of the Heart, epilepsy and mania.

# **GB-14** · YÁNGBÁI (陽白) · *Yang White*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
In theory, the forehead is most closely associated with the yangming channel. In clinical practice pain of the forehead region may be due to involvement either of yangming channel, in which case it is often accompanied by pain of the infraorbital region (often seen in sinusitis), or of shaoyang channel, in which case it is frequently accompanied by pain of the temporal or parietal regions and eye (often seen in migrainous headaches). Yángbái GB-14 is a meeting point of the Gall Bladder shaoyang channel with the Stomach and Large Intestine yangming channels, and is therefore the pre-eminent local point in the treatment of pain of the forehead, whether due to interior disharmony or invasion of exterior pathogenic factors. Some classical sources, for example the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, also imply that Yángbái GB-14 can dispel wind-cold from the body as a whole and recommend it for inability to get warm despite wearing much clothing, and shivering and aversion to cold on the back.

Yángbái GB-14 is also an important local point for the treatment of various diseases of the eyes and eyelids due to a wide range of aetiologies, especially exterior or interior wind, manifesting as lacrimation, deviation of the eye, drooping, twitching or itching of the eyelids, pain and itching of the pupils and night-blindness.

Summary of clinical application
Meeting point of the Gall Bladder, Stomach and Large Intestine channels: important point for pain of the forehead whether extending to the eye, the infraorbital region (e.g. sinusitis) or the temporal or parietal regions.
Important local point for various diseases of the eyes and eyelids: lacrimation, deviation of the eye, drooping, twitching or itching of the eyelids, pain and itching of the pupils, nightblindness.

# **GB-15** · TÓULÍNQÌ (頭臨泣) · *Head Governor of Tears*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
As its name (Head Governor of Tears) implies, Tóulínqì GB-15 is indicated for lacrimation as well as for redness and pain of the eyes and superficial visual obstruction. In this respect it mirrors Zulinqi Gb 41 (Foot Governor of Tears) towards the distal end of the channel. Like several other points on the crown of the head (e.g. Tōngtiān BL-7 and Shàngxīng DU-23) it also has a pronounced action on the nose and is indicated for nasal congestion.

Summary of clinical application
For lacrimation, redness and pain of the eyes, superficial visual obstruction, nasal congestion.

# **GB-19** · NǍOKŌNG (腦空) · *Brain Hollow*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion records how Hua Tuo, the famous 2nd century physician, treated General Wei Tai-cu (the posthumously consecrated emperor of the Wei dynasty) for 'head wind, confused mind and visual dizziness'. After needling Nǎokōng GB-19, the General was cured. This story, however, also appears in an earlier source in which the point needled is Yǒngquǎn KID-1.

Summary of clinical application
Indicated for headache, head wind, brain wind, one-sided headache and heaviness of the head, stiffness and pain of the neck with inability to turn the head, wind dizziness, redness, swelling and pain of the eyes, deafness and tinnitus, pain of the nose, nasal congestion, nosebleed, fright palpitations, mania depression disorder, taxation disorders with emaciation, heat in the body.

# **GB-2** · TĪNGHUÌ (聽會) · *Meeting of Hearing*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
There are three points anterior to the tragus of the ear, Tīnghuì GB-2 inferiorly, Ěrmén SJ-21 superiorly and Tīnggōng SI-19 in the centre. All are frequently employed in the treatment of a wide variety of ear disorders, including tinnitus, deafness, pain, itching and discharge. Due to the close proximity of these points and the similar indications for each, it is difficult to distinguish between them clinically, although each practitioner may have their individual preference. If it is necessary to needle points around the ear regularly, then these three points should be alternated.

In addition to its ability to treat ear disorders, Tīnghuì GB-2 is able to eliminate wind and to activate the channel in the surrounding region, and is indicated for deviation of the mouth and eyes, mumps, toothache, and difficult mastication and other jaw disorders.

Summary of clinical application
Important point for a wide variety of ear disorders, including tinnitus, deafness, pain, itching and discharge.
Eliminates wind and activates the channel: deviation of the mouth and eyes, mumps, toothache, difficult mastication and other jaw disorders.

# **GB-20** · FĒNGCHÍ (風池) · *Wind Pool*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Fēngchí GB-20, located at the nape of the neck, occupies a pivotal position between the head and the body and is one of the pre-eminent acupuncture points to treat all diseases of the head, brain and sensory organs, especially the eyes.

Wind, a yang pathogenic factor whose nature is to harass the uppermost (and therefore most yang) part of the body, may be of two kinds: i. exterior pathogenic wind which attacks the most superficial portion of the body, and ii. interior wind which has its origin in disharmony of the Liver. As its name (Wind Pool) implies, Fēngchí GB-20 is an important local point to treat both kinds of wind disease affecting the head.

Exterior wind is known as the 'spearhead of the hundred diseases' and easily combines with other pathogenic factors and drives them into the body. When exterior pathogenic wind, wind-cold or wind-heat injure the body, the characteristic sign is chills and fever. Fēngchí GB-20 is a meeting point of the Gall Bladder channel with both the Yang Motility vessel and the Yang Linking vessel. The Yang Motility vessel is indicated for aversion to wind, whilst the Yang Linking vessel links all the yang channels of the body, including the Governing vessel. Yang corresponds to the exterior while yin corresponds to the interior, and the yang channels as a whole therefore relate more to the exterior portion of the body. According to the Classic of Difficulties3 "when the Yang Linking vessel is diseased, there will be severe chills and fever". Fēngchí GB-20 is especially indicated when injury by wind is accompanied by headache or other symptoms of the head region such as lacrimation, red and sore eyes, nasal congestion and discharge, sore throat, swelling of the face etc.

Fēngchí GB-20 is equally important to pacify pathologically ascending interior wind and to settle yang and clear fire from the head, and is therefore indicated for such disorders as headache, head wind, dizziness, deviation of the mouth and eyes, hemiplegia and lockjaw as well as for hypertension.

According to a saying of Chinese medicine, "The head is the residence of the yang". The Yang Linking vessel links all the yang channels and connects with the Governing vessel (which enters the brain) at Yǎmén DU-15 and Fēngfǔ DU-16, and Fēngchí GB-20 is the single most important acupuncture point in the treatment of headache, whatever the aetiology and whichever the involved channels. A more specific recommendation is found in the Ode of the Jade Dragon which proposes the use of Fēngchí GB-20 for 'head wind with phlegm' and Hégǔ L.I.-4 for 'head wind without phlegm'. In the same way that it treats any variety of headache, Fēngchí GB-20 may be used for dizziness due to any pattern of disharmony.

Fēngchí GB-20 has a strong action on the eyes and nose, and to a lesser extent the ears, and is indicated for red and painful eyes, visual disorders, lacrimation, nosebleed, rhinitis, nasal congestion and discharge, tinnitus and deafness whether due to interior disharmony or exterior wind. By virtue of its connection with the Yang Linking vessel, and hence the Governing vessel, and of its action of pacifying interior wind, it is also effective in 'awakening' the brain and can be used for such symptoms as the sequelae of windstroke, loss of speech following windstroke, epilepsy and loss of memory.

Fēngchí GB-20 has a strong effect on activating the channel and alleviating pain, and is an important point in the treatment of disorders of the neck, shoulders and upper back. It is interesting to note that Fēngchí GB-20 is also indi-cated for lumbar pain and 'crooked lumbar spine leading to flaccidity and lack of strength in the sinews of the neck'.

The wide range of disorders of the head and neck that may be treated by Fēngchí GB-20 is reflected in the variety of needle directions that may be employed at this point. In the treatment of neck disorders, Fēngchí GB-20 is normally needled either perpendicularly or towards opposite Fēngchí GB-20; in the treatment of nose disorders it is needled towards the tip of the nose; in the treatment of eye disorders it is needled towards the opposite eye, and in the treatment of mental disorders towards Yìntáng M-HN-3.

Summary of clinical application
Essential point in the treatment of any pattern of headache in any region of the head.
For exterior diseases (chills and fever etc.) accompanied by headache, lacrimation, red and sore eyes, nasal congestion and discharge, sore throat, facial oedema etc.
Descends interior wind and uprising yang: headache, head wind, dizziness, deviation of the mouth and eyes, hemiplegia, lockjaw, hypertension.
Important point for disorders of the sense organs: red and painful eyes, visual disorders, lacrimation, nosebleed, rhinitis, nasal congestion and discharge, tinnitus, deafness.
For disorders of the brain: windstroke, loss of speech following windstroke, epilepsy, loss of memory.
For disorders of the neck, shoulders and upper back.

# **GB-21** · JIĀNJǏNG (肩井) · *Shoulder Well*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The region of Jiānjǐng GB-21, at the crest of the trapezius muscle, is particularly prone to symptoms of contraction, tightness and pain due to a variety of aetiologies. The Gall Bladder is interiorly-exteriorly coupled with the Liver. Stagnation of Liver qi or uprising of Liver yang due to anger, frustration, resentment etc. commonly vent upwards along the Gall Bladder channel, and readily accumulate in and below the neck, especially when tightness and restriction in the relatively narrow neck region prevent their upward flow. The close relationship between the upper body and anger was emphasised in many texts, for example the Essential Questions4 which stated "anger will cause the qi to surge upwards". Alternatively, the region of Jiānjǐng GB-21 may be injured by sprain, penetration by wind-cold (especially after sleeping in a cold draught), prolonged poor posture or occupational strain. Jiānjǐng GB-21 may be needled in all such cases of stiffness of the neck and shoulders, which may extend to the back or arm.

Jiānjǐng GB-21 is indicated for a variety of phlegm disorders. Phlegm may involve Liver or Gall Bladder pathology in the following three ways: i. Liver qi stagnation leads to stagnation of fluids which condense into phlegm, summed up in the statement in the Treatise on Disorders of Blood "When qi flows, water also flows", ii. Liver wind ascends carrying phlegm with it (this is one of the main pathological features of windstroke), and iii. Liver or Gall Bladder fire steams and condenses fluids into phlegm. By virtue of its actions of regulating qi, lowering and transforming phlegm and dissipating nodules, Jiānjǐng GB-21 is used in the treatment of such phlegm disorders as hemiplegia, loss of speech following windstroke, windstroke, scrofula and goitre.

Jiānjǐng GB-21 also has a strong qi descending action and is indicated in various disorders of rebellious qi such as cough and dyspnoea, rebellion of qi, and leg qi ascending to attack the Heart. Leg qi is a disorder characterised by numbness, pain, weakness, spasm, swelling, redness and heat sensations of the feet and legs. In severe cases the pathogen attacks more deeply affecting the abdomen and Heart.

Difficult labour may be due to stagnation or deficiency of qi and blood. In either case, due to its strong descending action, Jiānjǐng GB-21 has long been used to expedite delivery and promote the descent of the placenta, and for this reason is contraindicated in pregnancy. Jiānjǐng GB-21 is also specifically indicated by the Classic of Supplementing Life with Acupuncture and Moxibustion for "Inversion counterflow coldness of the arms and legs following miscarriage". A similar condition in post-partum women is described by the famous Qing dynasty gynaecologist Fu Qing-zhu who says "In the course of delivery, some women overexert themselves with taxation and fatigue injuring the Spleen. As a result, there occurs inversion with counterflow chilling of the limbs, qi ascends to fill up the chest, the pulse departs, and form deserts"5. The implied ability of Jiānjǐng GB-21 to tonify deficiency following miscarriage, is surprisingly mirrored in its indications for a variety of deficiency patterns including wind-taxation, the five taxations and seven injuries, Kidney deficiency lumbar pain and steaming bone disorder.

So strong is the action of Jiānjǐng GB-21 in descending qi that Gao Wu, in the Ode of Xi-hong, says "When you needle Jiānjǐng GB-21 you must needle Zúsānlǐ ST-36. If this is not done, the qi will not be regulated". In other words, the action of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 on tonifying and raising the qi will help to counter any excessive descent of the qi resulting from needling Jiānjǐng GB-21.

Jiānjǐng GB-21 is also indicated for breast disorders. The Gall Bladder primary channel penetrates the chest and the Gall Bladder sinew channel connects with the breast, whilst Jiānjǐng GB-21 is a meeting point of the Gall Bladder channel with the Stomach channel which descends through the nipple. Excessive worry, anger, frustration, resentment or depression may lead to stagnation and knotting of Liver qi, or accumulated heat in the Stomach channel may gather at the breast, leading to breast pain, breast abscess, and failure of the breast milk to flow. Jiānjǐng GB-21 may be selected in all these situations.

Summary of clinical application
For stiffness of the neck and shoulders (due to any aetiology) which may extend to the back or arm.
Descends qi: cough, dyspnoea, rebellion of qi, difficult labour.
Resolves phlegm: hemiplegia, loss of speech following windstroke, windstroke, scrofula, goitre.
For breast disorders: breast pain, breast abscess, failure of the breast milk to flow.

# **GB-23** · Zhéjīn (輒筋) · *Flank Sinews*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
According to the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion this point rather than Rìyuè GB-24 is the front-mu point of the Gall Bladder, and an alternative name for Zhéjīn GB-23 given in this classic was Danmu i.e. 'Gall Bladder Mu'. In fact the classical indications for Zhéjīn GB-23 and Rìyuè GB-24 are very similar, with a greater emphasis on disorders of the chest in the case of Zhéjīn GB-23 reflecting its higher location.

Excessive anger, frustration and resentment, especially when not spontaneously expressed, will impair the free-flowing function of the Liver. Qi stagnates along the course of the Gall Bladder channel in the lateral costal region, and binds the chest, restricting its smooth expansion and contraction. Breathing is impaired leading to fullness and pain, sighing and sadness. Zhéjīn GB-23 is an important local point used in the treatment of these conditions. If stagnation of qi transforms to fire it may affect the upper jiao (Heart) giving rise to sleep disturbance, the middle jiao leading to vomiting and acid regurgitation, or the lower jiao giving rise to heat of the lower abdomen.

Summary of clinical application
According to the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion this point rather than Rìyuè GB-24 was designated as the front mu point of the Gall Bladder.
Moves stagnant qi: fullness of the chest, pain of the lateral costal region, dyspnoea, asthma, sighing and tendency to sadness, insomnia.

# **GB-24** · RÌYUÈ (日月) · *Sun and Moon*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
According to the Essential Questions6 "The Gall Bladder is the upright official from where judgement emanates". When the characters for sun and moon (the name of this point) are combined, they form a new character 'ming' which means 'clear', intelligent' or 'to understand'. 'Ming' describes the quality of judgement emanating from a healthy Gall Bladder. Rìyuè GB-24 has traditionally been ascribed the ability to rectify deficiency patterns of the Gall Bladder and was indicated as early as the Essential Questions (with Dǎnshū BL-19) for the treatment of Gall Bladder deficiency giving rise to indecisiveness, and elsewhere for sighing with a tendency to sadness.

Rìyuè GB-24 was established as the front-mu point of the Gall Bladder by the time of the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic. Although many centuries later the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion designated Zhéjīn GB-23 as the Gall Bladder front-mu point, it is Rìyuè GB-24 which has retained this status to the present day. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body. Rìyuè GB-24 is an important point to treat diseases of the Gall Bladder fu which may derive from the following three aetologies: i. emotional disharmony results in stagnation of Liver qi which impairs the circulation of qi in its interiorly-exteriorly related Gall Bladder channel, and gives rise to distention, fullness and pain of the lateral costal region, sighing and a sensation of heat in the lower abdomen; ii. disharmony of the Stomach and Spleen transportation and transformation function leads to accumulation of dampness which transforms to damp-heat and ferments in the Liver and Gall Bladder; bile does not flow and seeps into the muscles and skin giving rise to jaundice; iii. Gall Bladder qi invades the Stomach and interferes with its descending function resulting in vomiting, acid regurgitation, hiccup and epigastric pain. All these three patterns may be encountered in diseases such as cholecystitis, cholelithiasis and hepatitis.

Summary of clinical application
Tonifies Gall Bladder qi: indecisiveness, sighing with a tendency to sadness.
Resolves Gall Bladder qi stagnation, Gall Bladder damp-heat and disharmony of the Gall Bladder and Stomach: distention, fullness and pain of the lateral costal region, abdominal distention, jaundice, vomiting, acid regurgitation, hiccup, epigastric pain.

# **GB-25** · JĪNGMÉN (京門) · *Capital Gate*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Jīngmén GB-25 is the front-mu point of the Kidneys. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body.

The main action of Jīngmén GB-25 is to assist the mutual relationship between the Kidneys and the Spleen. According to the Complete Works of Jing-yue "Ming men is the sea of essence [and] blood, the Spleen is the sea of water and grain, together they are the root of the five zang and six fu". The Kidneys are the source of pre-heaven qi and rule the fluids, whilst the Spleen is the source of post-heaven qi, and rules the transportation and transformation of food and water. The Kidney yang is the root of all the yang of the body, and its fire is the source for the vigour of the Spleen's transportation and transformation function. At the same time, it is the Spleen which extracts the essence from food to supplement the Kidney essence. When this mutual support between the Kidneys and Spleen breaks down, there will be impairment of both the Spleen's digestive function, and the Kidneys' function of ruling the fluids. Jīngmén GB-25 is indicated for cases of cold or damp (dong) diarrhoea, borborygmus and abdominal distention resulting from Spleen yang deficiency which either derives from Kidney yang deficiency, or due to its prolonged nature has injured the Kidney yang. It is also used to tonify Kidney yang to facilitate the flow of water in urinary diseases and is indicated for difficult urination, concentrated urine, swelling of the face and 'failure of the water passages to flow'.

The Kidneys rule the lumbar region and the bones. The other principal application of Jīngmén GB-25 is in the treatment of disorders of the lumbar region and spine, particularly when due to deficiency of the Kidneys. It is therefore indicated for weakness of the spine and for lumbar pain with inability to stand for long. Due to its location on the Gall Bladder channel it is also indicated for combined pain of the back and lateral costal region, for example in renal colic, as well as for pain of the hip.

# **GB-26** · DÀIMÀI (帶脈) · *Girdling Vessel*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The Girdling vessel, encircling the waist like a belt, is the only major channel that runs horizontally. It passes through the points Dàimài GB-26, Wǔshū GB-27 and Wéidào GB-28, and encircles and binds the Penetrating, Conception and Governing vessels and the Kidney, Liver and Spleen channels. The Girdling vessel plays an important role in controlling leucorrhoea and may be damaged by turbid dampness which sinks downwards, deficiency of Kidney yin or Kidney yang, invasion of exterior dampness which transforms into heat, or pouring down of Liver and Gall Bladder channel damp-heat, all of which may result in leucorrhoea. In fact, the term 'dai xia' (leucorrhoea) is made up of the characters 'dai', meaning belt or girdle, and 'xia', meaning downward. As the most important point to regulate the qi of the Girdling vessel, Dàimài GB-26 is indispensable in the treatment of leucorrhoea resulting from any of the above patterns.

According to the Spiritual Pivot7 "The Penetrating and Conception vessels both start in the uterus", whilst Confucians' Duties to Their Parents, the 13th century classic by Zhang Cong-zheng, states "The Penetrating, Conception and Governing vessels have the same starting point but different circulation, the same source but different branches, each of them connects with the Girdling vessel". The Conception vessel, Penetrating vessel and Governing vessel therefore all originate in the uterus in females and are all bound by the Girdling vessel. Dàimài GB-26 is not just an important point to activate the Girdling vessel itself, but has a significant influence on the Conception and Penetrating vessels, and is able to treat disorders of the uterus and menstruation such as infertility, irregular menstruation and amenorrhoea, and sinking of qi giving rise to uterine prolapse.

As well as regulating the qi of the Girdling vessel, Dàimài GB-26 is effective as a local point to resolve stagnation of qi deriving from disharmony of the Liver. Disorder of the Girdling vessel and qi stagnation in the lower jiao may lead to pain, distention and hardness of the lower abdomen in women, pain of the lateral costal region, shan disorder and lumbar pain.

Summary of clinical application
Important point in the treatment of leucorrhoea due to any aetiology.
Treats disorders of the uterus and menstruation: infertility, irregular menstruation, amenorrhoea, uterine prolapse.
Moves qi stagnation in the lower jiao: pain, distention and hardness of the lower abdomen in women, pain of the lateral costal region, shan disorder, lumbar pain.

# **GB-29** · JŪLIÁO (居髎) · *Stationary Crevice*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Jūliáo GB-29 is very commonly used in clinical practice in the treatment of hip disorders, and is especially indicated when pain radiates from the hip to the groin and lower abdomen. Correct needling will ensure radiation of sensation to these areas.

In the cross-needling method of point selection, the shoulder joint in the upper body corresponds to the hip joint in the lower body, and Jūliáo GB-29 is not only indicated for hip pain radiating forward to the groin, but also for shoulder pain radiating forward to the chest.

Summary of clinical application
Important local point for disorders of the hip joint, especially when pain radiates from the hip to the groin and lower abdomen.
Also for pain of the back and leg, lumbar pain radiating to the lower abdomen, weakness and paralysis of the leg, sciatica, shan disorder, pain of the front of the shoulder radiating to the chest, inability to raise the arm.

# **GB-3** · SHÀNGGUĀN (上關) · *Above the Joint*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Although less important than its neighbouring point Xiàguān ST-7, Shàngguān GB-3 may be used as a local point in the treatment of disorders of the surrounding region, including the ears, eyes, face, teeth, jaw, lips and head. In the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia it is sometimes needled 0.5 cun anterior to its textbook location.

Summary of clinical application
Clinically mostly used for trigeminal neuralgia.
Also for disorders of the ears (deafness, tinnitus, purulent discharge), eyes (dimness of vision), face (deviation of the mouth and eye), teeth (toothache of the upper jaw), jaw (lockjaw), lips (stiffness ) and head (headache).

# **GB-30** · HUÁNTIÀO (環跳) · *Jumping Circle*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Huántiào GB-30 was included by Ma Dan-yang, the great physician of the Jin dynasty, among the 'eleven heavenly star points'9, his grouping of the most vital acupuncture points, and was indicated by him for " ... cold wind and damp painful obstruction, pain radiating from the hip to the calf, sighing with pain when turning over". Huántiào GB-30 is unrivalled in importance for the treatment of disorders of the hip joint and buttock, whether due to traumatic injury, painful obstruction, stagnation of qi or deficiency.

Huántiào GB-30 is located at the pivotal hip region, the gate of the lower limb, and as its name 'Jumping Circle' implies, is able to influence the movement of the whole lower limb. It is a vital point to promote circulation of qi and blood in the treatment of all kinds of painful obstruction, atrophy disorder, numbness, stiffness, pain and contraction of the leg. In the treatment of sciatica, it is considered by many practitioners to be the single most important point which may be used whatever the nature and distribution of the pain. Its importance in the treatment of painful obstruction of the lower extremities was emphasised in the Secrets of the Heavenly Star which asked "Cold wind damp painful obstruction, where do you needle? First choose Huántiào GB-30, then Yánglíngquán GB-34". Its ability to promote circulation throughout the leg also renders it an essential point in the treatment of hemiplegia with an action similar to points of the yangming Stomach channel.

The Bladder channel unites with the Gall Bladder channel at this point, and Huántiào GB-30 can therefore also treat disorders of the lumbar region (through which the Bladder channel courses), whether extending to the hip and buttock, or radiating upwards along the Gall Bladder channel to the lateral costal region.

Finally Huántiào GB-30 is cited in the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc.

Summary of clinical application
Essential point for sciatica and for all disorders of the leg: painful obstruction, atrophy disorder, numbness, stiffness, pain and contraction.
Essential local point for disorders of the hip joint; also for when pain radiates from the hip to the lumbar or lateral costal regions.

# **GB-33** · XĪYÁNGGUĀN (膝陽關) · *Knee Yang Gate*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
An alternative name for Xīyángguān GB-33 is Hanfu (Mansion of Cold). This name reflects the observation that pathogenic cold tends to concentrate at the lateral side of knee, and that it may be treated by using this point. In clinical practice, Xīyángguān GB-33 is a valuable local point for pain of the lateral side of the knee which extends upwards along the thigh.

Summary of clinical application
Valuable local point for redness, swelling, stiffness and pain of the lateral side of the knee.

# **GB-36** · WÀIQIŪ (外丘) · *Outer Hill*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Wàiqiū GB-36 is the xi-cleft point of the Gall Bladder channel. The xi-cleft points are where the qi and blood, which flow relatively superficially along the channels from the jing-well points, gather and plunge more deeply. The xi-cleft points in general are indicated in the treatment of acute conditions and pain, and Wàiqiū GB-36 is indicated for pain of the skin. Thus the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion said "Painful skin with atrophy disorder and painful obstruction, principally select Wàiqiū GB-36".

Unusually, this point is also indicated for rabies. The Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man said "Rabies with chills and fever, quickly moxa Wàiqiū GB-36 three times and then moxa the bitten area".

Summary of clinical application
Xi-cleft point of the Gall Bladder hence indicated for acute conditions and pain: pain of the skin, and rabies with chills and fever.
Also indicated for distention of the chest and lateral costal region, pigeon chest in children, headache, mania, abdominal pain, atrophy disorder and painful obstruction of the lower limb, cold damp leg qi, cold sensation and stiffness and pain of the nape and neck, aversion to wind-cold.

# **GB-39** · XUÁNZHŌNG (懸鐘) · *Suspended Bell*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Xuánzhōng GB-39 is the hui-meeting point for the 'marrow' which is the source of both the 'sea of marrow' (the brain) and the bone marrow. There is little evidence in classical texts of the ability of Xuánzhōng GB-39 to nourish the sea of marrow, in other words to treat diseases of the head and brain, and even headache and dizziness are modern rather than traditional indications.

Xuánzhōng GB-39, however, has a strong action on benefiting the bone marrow, sinews and bones and is indicated for a wide range of disorders characterised by weakness, flaccidity, contraction and pain of the limbs. This latter action is complemented by its ability to dispel wind-damp. According to the Essential Questions19 "In bone painful obstruction the pathogenic factor reaches the Kidneys; in sinew painful obstruction it reaches the Liver". In chronic painful obstruction, therefore, prolonged retention of wind-damp which injures the sinews and bones will eventually deplete the Liver and Kidneys and hence the marrow. Prolonged deficiency of the Liver and Kidneys and insufficiency of essence, resulting in malnourishment of the sinews, may also give rise to atrophy disorder. By its action of nourishing the marrow and benefiting the sinews and bones Xuánzhōng GB-39 is therefore indicated for both chronic painful obstruction and atrophy disorder, hence the references to the use of Xuánzhōng GB-39 in wind-taxation with heaviness of the body, injury by cold pathogen leading to taxation and deficiency-taxation. The term taxation here denotes the extreme deficiency that arises due to chronic retention of pathogenic factors. According to the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries, the great Han dynasty physician Hua Tuo needled Xuánzhōng GB-39 and Huántiào GB-30 for lameness of the legs, and "immediately the patient was able to walk".

The Gall Bladder primary and sinew channels pass through different portions of the neck. By virtue of its actions of benefiting the sinews and bones and activating the channel and alleviating pain, Xuánzhōng GB-39 is the main distal point on the Gall Bladder channel for disorders of the neck, both acute and chronic.

Xuánzhōng GB-39 has a further action of promoting the smooth flow of Liver and Gall Bladder qi, and clearing Gall Bladder fire primarily arising from the transformation of stagnant qi. It is indicated for distention of the chest and abdomen, fullness and distention of the Heart and abdomen, soreness and pain of the lateral costal region, anxiety, indignation, anger and mania. Gall Bladder fire may easily transmit to the Stomach, resulting in Stomach heat, or obstruct the Stomach descending function leading to lack of appetite. The Gall Bladder sinew channel binds at the side of the nose and the primary channel connects with the Governing vessel at Chángqiáng DU-1. By clearing Gall Bladder fire, Xuánzhōng GB-39 is also indicated for dryness of the nose, nosebleed and haemorrhoids.

Summary of clinical application
Treats weakness, flaccidity, contraction and pain of the limbs; for chronic painful obstruction and chronic atrophy disorder. “In bone painful obstruction the pathogenic factor reaches the Kidneys; in sinew painful obstruction it reaches the Liver” (Essential Questions).
Important distal point for stiffness and pain of the neck.
Clears stagnant qi and fire: distention and pain of the chest, Heart, lateral costal region and abdomen; anxiety, indignation, anger and mania; nosebleed and haemorrhoids.

# **GB-4** · HÀNYÀN (頷厭) · *Jaw Serenity*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Yan Zheng-shi of the Ming dynasty, in Investigation of Points Along the Channels, recommended Hànyàn GB-4 specifically for head wind with pain in the region of both Tàiyáng M-HN-9 points. Clinically, Hànyàn GB-4 should always be palpated in cases of one-sided headache, and needled if tender. Unusually for a point on the head, Hànyàn GB-4 is also indicated in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion for pain and stiffness of the wrist as well as 'joint wind' (i.e. painful obstruction) accompanied by sweating.

Summary of clinical application
For one-sided headache, especially with pain at bilateral Tàiyáng M-HN-9.

# **GB-43** · XIÁXĪ (俠谿) · *Clamped Stream*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
According to the Classic of Difficulties22 ying-spring points are indicated for 'heat in the body'. The Gall Bladder channel traverses the sides of the head, enters the ear and connects with the eye. Xiáxī GB-43, the ying-spring point of the Gall Bladder channel, is indicated for Liver and Gall Bladder heat which ascends along the channel to the head and gives rise to such symptoms as headache, dizziness, deafness, tinnitus, ear pain, redness and pain of the outer canthus and itching of the eyes. It is interesting to note, however, that although much used for one-sided head-ache in modern-day clinical practice, headache is not mentioned as an indication for this point in any of the major classical texts, although Xiáxī GB-43 does appear in point combinations for head wind.

Both the Gall Bladder fu and the Gall Bladder channel are prone to suffer from damp-heat. It is a general principle of the channels, most clearly seen on the leg yang channels, that the points close to the knee (especially the he-sea points) treat the internal fu, and the more distal points (especially the jing-well and ying-spring points) treat disorders of the channel. Whilst not applicable for damp-heat distressing the Gall Bladder fu, therefore, Xiáxī GB-43 as befits its distal location is an important point for damp-heat (usually in combination with qi stagnation) which congests the channel giving rise to swelling in various regions of the body. In the upper body it is indicated for swelling of the cheek or submandibular region. In the chest it is able to treat pain of the chest and lateral costal region, breast abscess and discharging breast abscess (reflecting both the pathway of the Gall Bladder sinew channel to the breasts and the close relationship between the Gall Bladder's coupled Liver channel and the breasts). In the lower body it may be used for dampness and heat which sink downwards and give rise to swelling of the knee, toes or dorsum of the foot, and damp erosion and cracking between the toes.

Summary of clinical application
Clears Gall Bladder fire from the head: headache, dizziness, deafness, tinnitus, ear pain, redness and pain of the outer canthus, itching of the eyes.
Clears damp-heat from the Gall Bladder channel: swelling of the cheek or submandibular region, pain of the chest and lateral costal region, breast abscess, discharging breast abscess, swelling of the knee, toes or dorsum of the foot, damp erosion and cracking between the toes.

# **GB-8** · Shuàigǔ (率谷) · *Leading Valley*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Shuàigǔ GB-8 is an important point for treating parietal or temporal headache and heaviness, especially when unilateral, and is frequently found to be tender in such cases. The Gall Bladder primary and sinew channels traverse the side of the head, and the Gall Bladder channel is interiorly-exteriorly related to the Liver channel. Shuàigǔ GB-8 is particularly indicated in cases where exterior wind attacks the head, or Liver fire, Liver yang or Liver wind ascend along the Gall Bladder channel to harass the head causing severe one-sided headache.

According to the Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man Shuàigǔ GB-8 is especially indicated for "cold and phlegm in the diaphragm and Stomach, injury by alcohol, wind giving rise to severe and stubborn pain at both corners of the brain, inability to eat and drink, agitation and fullness with ceaseless vomiting". This is a clear reference to migrainous headache. Since Shuàigǔ GB-8 harmonises the diaphragm and Stomach, it is the main point on the head to treat headache accompanied by vomiting due to attack on the Stomach by Liver qi, or to Gall Bladder and Stomach phlegm-heat. Alcohol may induce migraine headache and vomiting by aggravating Liver heat and disrupting the harmony between the Liver and the Stomach, or by inducing or aggravating damp-heat in the Gall Bladder and Stomach. Many classics therefore recommend this point for headache and vomiting induced by alcohol.

Shuàigǔ GB-8 is also indicated for accumulation of phlegm in the diaphragm and Stomach, giving rise to ceaseless vomiting and 'phlegm qi diaphragm pain'. In clinical practice the pattern of phlegm or phlegm-heat in the Stomach is commonly seen in combination with Gall Bladder stagnation and heat. Shuàigǔ GB-8 is especially indicated when these symptoms are accompanied by one-sided headache.

Summary of clinical application
Important point for parietal or temporal headache and heaviness, especially when one-sided and due to exterior wind, Liver fire, Liver yang or Liver wind.
Important for migrainous headaches accompanied by nausea and vomiting and induced by alcohol.
Also for accumulation of phlegm in the diaphragm and Stomach, giving rise to ceaseless vomiting and pain of the diaphragm.

# **GB-9** · TIĀNCHŌNG (天沖) · *Heavenly Rushing*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Chapter 21 of the Spiritual Pivot lists five points known as the points of the Window of Heaven (Rényíng ST-9, Fútú L.I.-18, Tiānyǒu SJ-16, Tiānzhù BL-10 and Tiānfǔ LU-3). Chapter 2 of the same text gives an unnamed list of ten points which includes the five Window of Heaven points and adds the points Tiāntú REN-22, Tiānchuāng SI-16, Tiānróng SI-17, Fēngfǔ DU-16 and Tiānchí P-1. This passage first discusses Tiāntú REN-22, and then the six yang channel points as a sequence of vertical lines spreading from the Conception vessel and ending with Fēngfǔ DU-16 on the Governing vessel, with Tiānfǔ LU-3 and Tiānchí P-1 as additional points. Later commentators (particularly Ma Shi, the great physician of the Ming dynasty and expert on the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic) pointed out that this passage discusses Tiānróng SI-17 as a point of shaoyang channel whereas in fact it is a point of the hand taiyang channel. They therefore suggested that Tiānróng SI-17 should in fact be Tiānchōng GB-9. If so, all the six yang channels would then be represented.

These ten points have certain common properties, being indicated especially for disharmony between the head and body, disorders of the head and sense organs, goitre and scrofula, rebellion of Lung or Stomach qi and emotional disorders.

Many classics indicate Tiānchōng GB-9 for a variety of mental and psychological diseases characterised by propensity to fear and fright, fright palpitations, epilepsy, madness etc. According to modern acupuncture research in psychiatric hospitals, many head points are effective in treating disorders of the underlying portion of the brain, and this may help explain these traditional indications.

Summary of clinical application
Some commentators believe this to be one of the ten points of the Window of Heaven rather than Tiānróng SI-17.
For propensity to fear and fright, fright palpitations, epilepsy and madness.
