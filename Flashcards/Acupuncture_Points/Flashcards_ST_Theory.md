# **ST-1** · CHÉNGQÌ (承泣) · *Container of Tears*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Chéngqì ST-1 is one of the two principal local points of the primary channels for the treatment of eye diseases (the other being Jīngmíng BL-1), and is the meeting of a network of channels. The Stomach primary channel meets the Bladder channel at Jīngmíng BL-1 before descending along the infraorbital ridge to Chéngqì ST-1, the Stomach divergent channel connects with the eye, and the Stomach sinew channel joins with the Bladder sinew channel to form a muscular net around the eye.

The aetiology and pathology of eye disorders is complex and varied but may be simplified into i. attack by exterior pathogenic wind-heat or wind-cold, ii. interior disharmony (primarily flaring of Liver fire, uprising of Liver yang or deficiency of Liver yin and blood), or iii. a combination of both interior disharmony and exterior pathogens. Not only is Chéngqì ST-1 able to dispel pathogenic factors such as wind, cold and heat from the eye, but by strongly invigorating and stimulating the qi and blood of the local area it is equally applicable for disorders due to any kind of interior disharmony, and is therefore indicated for the fullest range of eye diseases. This includes the traditional categories of redness, swelling and pain, lacrimation, superficial visual obstruction, dimness of vision, short sightedness, night blindness, itching of the eyes, upward staring eyes, visual dizziness and twitching of the eyelids. In terms of modern disease categories, Chéngqì ST-1 is indicated for acute and chronic conjunctivitis, myopia, glaucoma, astigmatism, colour blindness, neuritis of the optic nerve, keratitis, and blepharospasm.

As the name 'Container of Tears' suggests, Chéngqì ST-1 is especially important in the treatment of excessive lacrimation, which is classically subdivided into cold or hot types, in both cases complicated by exterior wind. The cold type may be due to deficiency and cold of the Liver channel or exhaustion of the Liver and Kidneys, whilst the hot type may be due to Liver channel wind-heat or Liver yin deficiency with heat.

Summary of clinical application
One of the two principal local points of the primary channels (along with Jīngmíng BL-1​) for the treatment of all eye diseases: redness, swelling and pain, superficial visual obstruction, dimness of vision, inability to see distant objects, night blindness, itching of the eyes, upward staring eyes, twitching of the eyelids, acute and chronic conjunctivitis, myopia, glaucoma, astigmatism, colour blindness, neuritis of the optic nerve, keratitis, and blepharospasm. Special for lacrimation.

# **ST-12** · QUĒPÉN (缺盆) · *Empty Basin*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Quepen ST-12, is a meeting point of the Stomach channel with all the primary yang channels except the Bladder, and its principal function is to descend rebellion of qi. This is reflected both by its ability to treat rebellion of Lung qi manifesting as cough, dyspnoea and fullness of the chest, as well as by the traditional observation that it is contraindicated in pregnancy. The Essential Questions8 includes Quepen ST-12 among the eight points (bilateral Quepen ST-12, Dazhu BL-11, Zhongfu LU-1 and Fengmen BL-12) to clear heat from the chest.

Quepen ST-12 is also indicated for pain of the supraclavicular fossa, pain of the shoulder that radiates to the neck, and numbness and pain of the upper limb.

Summary of clinical application
For rebellion of Lung qi manifesting as cough, dyspnoea and fullness of the chest.
For pain of the supraclavicular fossa, pain of the shoulder that radiates to the neck, and numbness and painful obstruction of the upper limb.

# **ST-18** · RǓGĒN (乳根) · *Root of the Breast*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Rǔgēn ST-18 is the principle local point for treating disorders of the breast. According to Zhu Dan-xi of the Jin-Yuan dynasty "The breasts are where the yangming passes, and the nipples are ascribed to the jueyin"9. Disharmony of the Stomach yangming or Liver jueyin channels is therefore involved in all breast disorders. Since Rǔgēn ST-18 regulates the qi and blood of the breast area as a whole, it may be used for any excess type breast disorder characterised by pain, distention, swelling or abscess, whether due to Stomach fire or oppression and stagnation of Liver qi (the two main excess interior pathological factors in breast disease).

Nursing mothers are particularly prone to breast disorders. Zhu Dan-xi went on to say "If the breast-feeding mother has thick flavoured [food] or bears indignation or grudges, qi will therefore stop circulating and the portals will become blocked. [Because] milk is no longer able to come out, the blood of the yangming becomes hot and transforms into pus"10. As well as breast abscess due to these internal factors, Rǔgēn ST-18 is also indicated when exposure of the breast to exterior pathogenic factors, improper suckling, or even, according to Zhu Dan-xi, the burning hot breath of the new-born baby blowing onto the breast, lead to heat, stagnation and swelling. As far as scanty lactation is concerned, this is most commonly due to stagnation of Liver qi resulting in failure of free flow, or to insufficiency of qi and blood, mainly due to deficiency of the Stomach and Spleen. Rǔgēn ST-18 is indicated whatever the pattern.

According to the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Rǔgēn ST-18 is recommended for "pain of the chest, diaphragm qi". This refers to oppression of the chest with shortness of breath due to stagnation of Liver qi. Rǔgēn ST-18 may also be used more widely for cough or asthma.

Finally, according to the Ode of Xi-hong, Rǔgēn ST-18 may be used to promote and hasten labour, although it is not traditionally contraindicated in pregnancy.

Summary of clinical application
The principle local point for treating disorders of the breast (abscess, pain, disorders of lactation).
Local point for stagnation of qi in the chest and diaphragm (cough, dyspnoea, oppression and pain).

# **ST-19** · BÙRÓNG (不容) · *Not Contained*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Because of its location, Bùróng ST-19 is sometimes selected for the treatment of hypochondriac pain, nausea and vomiting due to cholecystitis or cholelithiasis. Its name 'Not Contained' or 'Uncontainable' refers to the inability of the Stomach to retain its contents.

Summary of clinical application
Used for hypochondriac pain, nausea and vomiting, especially when due to cholecystitis or cholelithiasis.
Also indicated for cough, dyspnoea, difficult breathing with raised shoulders, pain of the chest, back, shoulder and intercostal region and pain of the Heart.

# **ST-2** · SÌBÁI (四白) · *Four Whites*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?

Summary of clinical application
Alternative to Chéngqì ST-1 in the treatment of eye diseases, especially for practitioners without experience of needling Chéngqì ST-1.
Local point for facial pain and paralysis.
For alleviating pain caused by round worms in the bile duct (joined to Yíngxiāng L.I.-20).

# **ST-21** · LIÁNGMÉN (梁門) · *Beam Gate*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Liangmen ST-21 is an important point for treating distention and pain due to stagnation of qi, especially in the lateral abdomen and the lateral costal region. It is used in preference to, or in combination with, Zhongwan REN‑12 when there is severe epigastric and abdominal pain, particularly in these lateral regions.

More widely, Liangmen ST-21 is able to regulate the Stomach and Spleen and transform food accumulation, being indicated for vomiting, poor appetite, borborygmus, undigested food in the stool and diarrhoea, especially slippery diarrhoea. This term refers to diarrhoea which, because of its persistent and chronic nature, leads to downward collapse of qi. The collapse of qi in turn leads to a worsening of the diarrhoea which becomes ceaseless both at night and during the day, and is accompanied by symptoms such as shortness of breath, loss of appetite, emaciation etc.

The term ‘liang’ in the name of Liangmen ST-21 refers to one of the ‘five accumulations’ discussed in the Classic of Difficulties. This form of accumulation is said to pertain to the Heart and is characterised by a palpable mass in the region below the Heart (epigastrium), and the use of Liangmen ST-21 is emphasised in various classics for epigastric pain and qi accumulation below both the chest and lateral costal region.

Summary of clinical application
For pain and distention of the abdomen (especially the lateral abdomen), epigastrium and lateral costal region, particularly when due to qi stagnation.
Also for vomiting, poor appetite, undigested food in the stool and diarrhoea.

# **ST-22** · GUĀNMÉN (關門) · *Pass Gate*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Guānmén ST-22 is included in two elegant combinations for the treatment of enuresis. Both also include Shénmén HE-7, reflecting the principle that the involuntary discharge of urine, especially during sleep, indicates a disorder of the spirit as much as a disorder of the urinary system.

Summary of clinical application
Rarely used.
Indicated for abdominal qi accumulation, sensation of qi moving in the abdomen, abdominal pain, abdominal distention and fullness, acute periumbilical pain, constipation, borborygmus, diarrhoea, dysenteric disorder, poor appetite, oedema, enuresis, phlegm malaria with cold shivering.

# **ST-23** · TÀIYǏ (太乙) · *Supreme Unity*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The action of this point on calming the spirit and treating psycho-emotional disorders (recorded in various classics) is attributable to three factors: i. its ability, like several points of the Stomach channel (most notably Fēnglóng ST-40) to assist the Spleen in transforming phlegm, ii. the internal connection between the Stomach divergent channel and the Heart zang, and iii. the meeting of the Stomach channel with the Governing vessel (and thus the brain) at points Shéntíng DU-24 and Rénzhōng DU-26, both of which strongly influence the brain and spirit.

Although there are many causes for the formation of phlegm, disharmony of the Stomach and Spleen is the most common. Once formed, phlegm or phlegm-heat may rise to veil the portals of the Heart and disturb the spirit, leading to such symptoms as mania-depression, agitation, and mad walking. The Heart channel ascends to the root of the tongue. When phlegm blocks the Heart there may be tongue thrusting, where the tongue is repeatedly thrust out of the mouth like a snake's tongue. This symptom is most commonly seen in the pattern of phlegm-heat accumulated in the Spleen and Heart, although it is also differentiated into Spleen and Kidney deficiency heat and may be seen in epilepsy. It is frequently accompanied by a red distended tongue, ulceration of the tongue, and thirst with desire for cold fluids.

The name 'Taiyi' (Supreme Unity) refers to the state of undifferentiated oneness that according to Daoist theory existed before the arising of yin and yang duality and the separation of heaven and earth. One explanation of the naming of this point is that Tàiyǐ ST-23 lies close to that region of the abdomen that brings about separation of the pure and impure contents of the digestion, but where this process has not yet taken place.

The dual action of Tàiyǐ ST-23 on psycho-emotional and abdominal disorders (such as pain and diarrhoea) renders it especially suitable for conditions where both present together. This combination of symptoms is commonly encountered in patients who present with anxiety focused both on the chest and abdomen, accompanied by palpitations, tightness of the chest, abdominal pain and diarrhoea.

# **ST-25** · TIĀNSHŪ (天樞) · *Heaven's Pivot*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The close relationship between the Stomach and intestines is emphasised in the Spiritual Pivot11 which states "the Small and Large Intestines both pertain to the Stomach". Furthermore, the Stomach is interiorly-exteriorly coupled with the Spleen which dominates transportation and transformation and plays an important role in regulating the intestines. Tiānshū ST-25 is the front-mu point of the Large Intestine, located on the Stomach channel, and is thus the point where the qi of the Large Intestine gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body.

Tiānshū ST-25, located on either side of the umbilicus, was said by the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries to dominate the middle region12, and its name 'Heaven's Pivot' or 'Celestial Pivot' refers to its central position between the upper and lower abdomen, the Stomach and the intestines. The Essential Questions states "[The area] above the celestial pivot is ruled by celestial qi; [the area] below the celestial pivot is ruled by the earthly qi. The place where these qi intersect is the origin of man's qi and the ten thousand things"13.

The two principal actions of Tiānshū ST-25 are i. treating intestinal disorders, and ii. regulating qi and eliminating stasis in the lower abdomen. Tiānshū ST-25 is the single most important point for the treatment of the widest variety of intestinal disorders. Due to its ability to regulate the Spleen and transform dampness, its forte is in the treatment of diarrhoea; indeed the Ode of the Jade Dragon states "The pattern of Spleen diarrhoea, look no further, needle bilateral Tiānshū ST-25". Diarrhoea and dysenteric disorder may be acute and due to accumulation of cold-damp, damp-heat or fire-poison, or may be chronic and due to deficiency of the Spleen and Kidneys or disharmony of the Liver and Spleen. Whatever the aetiology, Tiānshū ST-25 should form a pivotal role in the prescription, in combination with other suitable points selected according to differentiation. In modern practice Tiānshū ST-25 is much used in the treatment of bacillary dysentery and acute simple appendicitis in combination with such points as Shàngjùxū ST-37 and Qūchí L.I.-11. Although an important local point in the treatment of constipation, many authorities consider the more lateral Dàhéng SP-15 to be more effective.

The damp draining action of Tiānshū ST-25 is further evidenced by its indications for oedema, swelling of the face, drum distention and turbid painful urinary dysfunction.

Because of its central position between the upper and lower abdomen, the effect of Tiānshū ST-25 extends upwards to the Stomach. It is indicated for vomiting, retching and sudden turmoil disorder in which vomiting is accompanied by diarrhoea. Various classics also emphasise the ability of Tiānshū ST-25 to tonify deficiency, the Investigation Into Points Along the Channels recommending it for 'lower yuan (origin) deficient and cold' and the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries for 'deficiency damage'.

Tiānshū ST-25 also has an important action on regulating qi and eliminating stagnation in the lower abdomen. It is indicated for a wide range of problems including distention and pain of the abdomen, intestinal abscess, shan disorder, severe cutting periumbilical pain etc., as well as the treatment of menstrual disorders and abdominal or uterine masses due to stasis of either qi or blood.

Summary of clinical application
The principal local point for the treatment of intestinal diseases: appendicitis, diarrhoea, undigested food in the stool, dysenteric disorder, bacillary dysentry, borborygmus, constipation.
Also treats vomiting, retching and poor appetite.
Regulates qi and eliminates stagnation in the lower abdomen: abdominal pain and distention, intestinal abscess, shan disorder, abdominal masses in women, pain of the uterus, dysmenorrhoea, irregular menstruation.

# **ST-28** · SHUǏDÀO (水道) · *Water Passage*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Although this point is most commonly known as Shuidao (Water Passage), the great 7th century physician Sun Si-miao referred to left Shuidao as Baomen (Gate of the Uterus) and right Shuidao as Zihu (Child's Door)14, emphasising its action on gynaecological disorders. These two ways of naming this point reflect its dual actions of clearing stasis from the Bladder and promoting urination on the one hand, and clearing stasis of qi and blood from the uterus on the other. As far as the former action is concerned, Shuǐdào ST-28 is indicated when excess pathogenic factors obstruct the qi transformation function of the Bladder leading to retention of urine. As for the latter action, Shuǐdào ST-28 is particularly indicated for cold congealing the uterus (see Guīlái ST-29 for a fuller discussion) and giving rise to obstruction of blood, manifesting with a variety of symptoms of blood stasis such as dysmenorrhoea, infertility, menstrual pain radiating to the lumbar region or down the thighs, and retention of the placenta or retention of dead foetus. It is also specifically indicated for uterine (jia) masses, implying masses of indefinite form and changing location, primarily due to qi stagnation. The unifying factor between these two spheres of action is obstruction, emphasising that this point is almost exclusively used for excess patterns. Shuǐdào ST-28 is also indicated for pain of the lumbar region and pain of the shoulder and back and appears in at least two classical combinations for this purpose. This is an example of the method of selecting points from the front of the body to treat the back, and also reflects the fact that the Stomach sinew channel passes through the lower ribs and connects with the spine.

# **ST-29** · GUĪLÁI (归来) · *Return*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The name of this point 'Guilai' (Return) is normally understood to refer to its ability to restore the condition of the uterus and genitals to normal.

According to the Essential Questions15 "qi and blood desire warmth and dislike cold; when [there is] cold they coagulate; when [there is] warmth they disperse and flow". The Spiritual Pivot16 states "The blood [vessels], nutritive and defensive [qi] of man circulate without stopping, in the same way that the stars do in the upper region and the rivers in the lower region. When a cold pathogen comes to reside in the channels as a guest, the blood will coagulate; when the blood coagulates the channels do not move".

The over-riding action of Guīlái ST-29 is to warm the lower jiao, most particularly the uterus in women and the genital region in both men and women. Cold may be excess or deficient in nature. As far as excess cold is concerned, the uterus (along with the Stomach, Spleen and intestines) belongs to that group of the zangfu or extra fu that can suffer from direct penetration by exterior pathogenic cold (i.e. without initial symptoms and signs of an exterior pattern such as chills and fever, body aches etc.). Injury of the uterus by cold may be due to inadequate clothing or sitting on cold ground, or over-consumption of cold foods and drinks, especially during menstruation or after childbirth. Pathogenic cold causes stagnation of qi and coagulation of blood in the uterus and disrupts the function of the Conception and Penetrating vessels, giving rise to disorders such as amenorrhoea, irregular menstruation, uterine masses etc. Guīlái ST-29 is one of the primary points to warm the uterus and drive out pathogenic cold.

As far as deficiency cold is concerned, Guīlái ST-29 is also an important point for treating disorders due to decline of Kidney yang which generates cold, giving rise to irregular menstruation, amenorrhoea, infertility etc. The ability of Guīlái ST-29 to treat such disorders derives from its action of warming and benefiting the uterus rather than by directly tonifying Kidney yang. Guīlái ST-29 is also indicated for running piglet qi which may arise when Kidney yang deficiency leads to accumulation of cold in the lower jiao (see Qìchōng ST-30).

Amenorrhoea may be due to either excess or deficient patterns (stagnation of qi and stasis of blood, pathogenic cold, phlegm stagnation, blood deficiency, Kidney deficiency or heat pathogen which consumes yin blood). Due to its action of 'returning' the menstruation,Guīlái ST-29 is commonly used in the treatment of amenorrhoea due to any of these patterns.

The genital region in both men and women is equally susceptible to attack by pathogenic cold, giving rise to a variety of symptoms characterised by pain and retraction of the testicles, penis or vagina. As well as being able to warm and scatter excess cold in this region, Guīlái ST-29can firm and warm the lower jiao and is used in the treatment of disorders such as impotence, seminal emission, leucorrhoea and nocturnal urination due to decline of ming men fire.

Although the clinical manifestations will be somewhat different in each of the above situations, most will be characterised by aversion to cold and preference for and amelioration with heat. Since Guīlái ST-29 is mainly indicated for cold patterns it is particularly suited to treatment by combined needling and moxibustion.

Summary of clinical application
Warms and regulates the uterus and menstruation: amenorrhoea, irregular menstruation, uterine masses due to cold, uterine prolapse, coldness and pain and swelling of the vagina, infertility, leucorrhoea.
Warms and benefits the genitals: retraction of the testicles, impotence, pain of the penis, seminal emission, shan disorder.

# **ST-32** · FÚTÙ (伏兔) · *Crouching Rabbit*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Although principally used for channel disorders of the lower limb, the Sagelike Prescriptions from the Taiping Era recommends Fútù ST-32 for diseases of the eight regions in women. These are i. the external genitals, ii. the breast, iii. disorders of pregnancy, iv. post-partum disorders, v. uterine bleeding, vi. leucorrhoea, vii. menstruation and viii. abdominal masses.

# **ST-34** · LIÁNGQIŪ (梁丘) · *Ridge Mound*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Liángqiū ST-34 is the xi-cleft point of the Stomach channel and is the only one of the xi-cleft points of the twelve primary channels which is located proximal to the knee or elbow. It is an important adjacent point in the treatment of knee disorders (often combined with such points as Xiyan (MN-LE-16), Xuèhǎi SP-10, Yīnlíngquán SP-9 and Yánglíngquán GB-34) and for painful obstruction, cold and pain of the leg.

The xi-cleft points are where the qi and blood, which flow relatively superficially along the channels from the jing-well points, gather and plunge more deeply. The xi-cleft points in general are indicated in the treatment of acute conditions and pain. The yangming Stomach channel traverses the breast and passes through the nipple, and Liángqiū ST-34 is classically indicated for such acute disorders of the breast as swelling, pain and abscess. In clinical practice it is also used for acute epigastric pain, although this seems to be a modern rather than traditional usage.

Summary of clinical application
Xi-cleft point of the Stomach channel: acute epigastric pain, breast pain and breast abscess.
Adjacent point for knee disorders.

# **ST-35** · DÚBÍ (犊鼻) · *Calf's Nose*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Dúbí ST-35, located in the lateral visible hollow below the patella, is an essential point in the treatment of all knee disorders, whether due to deficiency or excess, heat or cold. In clinical practice it is frequently combined with the extra point medial Xiyan (located in the medial visible hollow below the patella), and is therefore most often known as lateral Xiyan.

Summary of clinical application
Important local point (often in combination with medial Xiyan) for the treatment of knee disorders: swelling and pain, difficulty in flexing and extending, weakness, numbness etc.

# **ST-37** · SHÀNGJÙXŪ (上巨虛) · *Upper Great Void*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic stated "The Large and Small intestines fall under the influence of the Stomach"34 and classified Shàngjùxū ST-37 as the lower he-sea point of the Large Intestine. The three yang channels of the arm (Large Intestine, Small Intestine and Sanjiao) are unique in that whilst the channels traverse the upper jiao, their respective fu belong to the lower jiao. Thus although the Spiritual Pivot states that the "He-sea points treat disorders of the internal fu", the he-sea points of these three channels (Qūchí L.I.-11, Xiǎohǎi SI-8, and Tiānjǐng SJ-10 respectively) have relatively little action on their related fu. The Large and Small Intestines and the Sanjiao, however, each have a lower he-sea point (Shàngjùxū ST-37, Xiàjùxū ST-39 and Wěiyáng BL-39) which predominantly treat disorders of their respective fu.

Shàngjùxū ST-37 is an important point in the treatment of a wide range of intestinal disorders. It is especially effective in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysenteric disorder, whether due to deficiency, cold, dampness, or damp-heat, and in recent times has been much used in the treatment of bacillary dysentery. Shàngjùxū ST-37 is also used in the treatment of stagnation and obstruction of the intestines, giving rise to distention and pain of the abdomen, constipation and intestinal abscess. This comprehensive ability of Shàngjùxū ST-37 to regulate the intestines was referred to in the earliest classics. For example, the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion recommends Shàngjùxū ST-37 for "heat in the Large Intestine, diarrhoea containing undigested food and borborygmus", whilst the tenth century classic Sagelike Prescriptions from the Taiping Era recommends it for insufficiency of Large Intestine qi.

Some classics ascribe qi tonifying actions to this point, for example "deficiency and weakness of Spleen and Stomach, insufficiency of zang qi, shortness of breath etc." These may be explained by the beneficial effect that firming the intestines in cases of loose stool and diarrhoea will have on the transportation and transformation function of the Spleen. It is also worth noting that acupuncture points immediately distal or proximal to very powerful points, often share some of their functions and indications. It is as though the influence of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is so great that it can resonate onto Shàngjùxū ST-37.

According to the Spiritual Pivot35 Shàngjùxū ST-37 is a point of the 'sea of blood'. This passage says "The Penetrating vessel is the sea of the twelve channels (i.e. the sea of blood). In the upper it is conveyed to Dàzhù BL-11, and in the lower it emerges at both Shàngjùxū ST-37 and Xiàjùxū ST-39 ... When the sea of blood is in excess, there is a sensation as if the body were big; one feels disquiet, but does not know what disease there is; when the sea of blood is insufficient, one has the sensation of one's body being small; one feels reduced but does not know what could be the illness". Despite this passage it is worth noting that such indications are not found in later texts.

In common with many points of the Stomach channel, Shàngjùxū ST-37 is especially effective in treating disorders of the lower limb as a whole. This action is explained by the saying "Yangming channels are abundant in qi and blood". The ability of Shàngjùxū ST-37 to promote the flow of smooth qi and blood throughout the leg renders it effective in the treatment of hemiplegia, leg qi, weakness of the leg, swelling of the knee and all kinds of atrophy disorder and painful obstruction, whether due to excess or deficiency patterns.

Finally, the Essential Questions36 includes Shàngjùxū ST-37 among the eight points to clear heat from the Stomach (bilateral Qìchōng ST-30, Zúsānlǐ ST-36, Shàngjùxū ST-37 and Xiàjùxū ST-39).

# **ST-39** · XIÀJÙXŪ (下巨虛) · *Lower Great Void*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic stated "The Large and Small intestines fall under the influence of the Stomach"37 and classified Xiàjùxū ST-39 as the lower he-sea point of the Small Intestine. The three yang channels of the arm (Large Intestine, Small Intestine and Sanjiao) are unique in that whilst the channels traverse the upper jiao, their respective fu belong to the lower jiao. Thus although the Spiritual Pivot states that the "He-sea points treat disorders of the internal fu", the he-sea points of these three channels (Qūchí L.I.-11, Xiǎohǎi SI-8, and Tiānjǐng SJ-10 respectively) have relatively little action on their related fu. The Large and Small Intestines and the Sanjiao, however, each have a lower he-sea point (Shàngjùxū ST-37, Xiàjùxū ST-39 and Wěiyáng BL-39) which predominantly treat disorders of their respective fu.

Xiàjùxū ST-39 may be used in two principal patterns of the Small Intestine, namely Small Intestine qi pain and Small Intestine deficient and cold. The former is characterised by severe pain of the lower abdomen which radiates to the waist and lumbar region and down to the testicles. The latter is characterised by (dull) lower abdominal pain (which is improved with warmth and pressure) and chronic diarrhoea or dysenteric disorder etc. Xiàjùxū ST-39 is further able to treat diarrhoea and dysenteric disorder due to damp heat which give rise to pus and blood in the stool.

The Essential Questions38 includes Xiàjùxū ST-39 among the eight points to clear heat from the Stomach, emphasising that as well as being the he-sea point of the Small Intestine, this point lies on the Stomach channel and is indicated for heat in the channel giving rise to disorders such as breast abscess, dry lips and throat painful obstruction. Unusually, Xiàjùxū ST-39 is also clearly ascribed some ability to regulate the Small Intestine channel, reflected in such indications as extreme sensation of cold and heat in the shoulder, heat sensation in the area between the ring and little fingers, and burning sensation in front of the ears.

For a discussion of Xiàjùxū ST-39 as a point of the 'sea of blood' refer to the commentary on Shàngjùxū ST-37.

Finally, Xiàjùxū ST-39 belongs to yangming channel which is abundant in qi and blood, and is similar to points such as Zúsānlǐ ST-36 and Shàngjùxū ST-37 in its ability to treat disorders of the lower limb. It is indicated for painful obstruction and atrophy disorder of the lower limb and foot, hemiplegia and heel pain.

Summary of clinical application
For Small Intestine qi pain and Small Intestine deficiency cold: lower abdominal pain, lumbar pain that radiates to the testicles, diarrhoea, dysenteric disorder, pus and blood in the stool, insufficiency of Small Intestine qi.
For painful obstruction, atrophy disorder, hemiplegia of the lower leg, atrophy disorder of the foot, heel pain.

# **ST-4** · DÌCĀNG (地倉) · *Earth Granary*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The 12th century classic Secret Writings of Bian Que states "use Dìcāng ST-4 in all cases where treacherous wind enters the ear, mouth and eye and leads to deviation". Dìcāng ST-4 is an important local point to eliminate wind from the face and is frequently used in the treatment of facial paralysis, whether due to exterior pathogenic wind or the sequelae of windstroke, particularly when the mouth is affected with symptoms such as drooling and deviation. Dìcāng ST-4 is also important in the treatment of facial pain such as trigeminal neuralgia. Pain of the face is usually differentiated into: i. invasion of the channels of the face by wind and cold, ii. flaring up of Stomach and Liver fire, and iii. heat due to yin deficiency. Due to its location, Dìcāng ST-4 may be needled whatever the pattern.

For both these applications, Dìcāng ST-4 is commonly joined to points such as Jiáchē ST-6, Quánliáo SI-18, Yíngxiāng L.I.-20 and Chéngjiāng REN-24 by transverse needling. The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion recommends needling left Dìcāng ST-4 for diseases of the right side of the face, and vice-versa. This principle of contralateral needling is discussed in the Spiritual Pivot2 which states "Contralateral insertion, that is, if the left is affected, the right is treated, and if the right affected, the left is needled", and the Essential Questions3 which says "When evils invade the channels, if the left side is in excess, the disease occurs on the right side, and vice versa ... for these conditions, contralateral insertion should be used". Although common practice emphasises needling the diseased side, these statements underline the important principle of treating the healthy side, where the qi is plentiful, in chronic cases and those involving great deficiency.

It is interesting to note the use of Dìcāng ST-4 for leg disorders, reflecting the principle stated in the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic4 "When the disease is below select [points] from above". Whilst the use of points on the lower body to treat diseases of the upper body is extremely common, the reverse is relatively rare. Other examples are Bǎihuì DU-20 for anal disorders, Rénzhōng DU-26 and Rényíng ST-9 for lumbar pain, and Shuàigǔ GB-8 for vomiting.

Summary of clinical application
Important local point for interior or exterior wind giving rise to: deviation of the mouth, face pain, trigeminal neuralgia, numbness of the lips and face, contraction of the facial muscles, inability to close the eye and twitching of the eyelids.
For facial paralysis and trigeminal neuralgia, frequently joined to points such as Jiáchē ST-6, Quánliáo SI-18 and Yíngxiāng L.I.-20 by transverse needling.
“Use Dìcāng ST-4 in all cases where treacherous wind enters the ear, mouth and eye and leads to deviation” (Secret Writings of Bian Que).

# **ST-6** · JIÁCHĒ (頰車) · *Jaw Bone*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Jiache ST-6 (Jaw Bone) is an important point in the treatment of a wide range of local disorders affecting the jaw, including inability to chew, inability to open the mouth after windstroke, lockjaw, and tension, pain or paralysis of the jaw. Its range of action extends upwards along the Stomach channel into the face for deviation of the mouth and eye and swelling of the cheek, and downwards along the channel for mumps, and stiffness and pain of the neck. The predominant pathogenic factor in all these different disorders is wind, whether of external or internal origin. Jiache ST-6 is also a major point in the treatment of disorders of the gum and teeth of the lower jaw.

Jiache ST-6 is one of the ‘thirteen ghost points’, listed under its alternative name Guichuang (Ghost’s Bed) in the Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas by Sun Simiao. This grouping of points was used to treat mania and epilepsy, and it is unclear why Jiache ST-6 was ascribed this action, especially in the light of the fact that there are no indications of this kind listed for the point. One possible explanation is the fear that epileptics might bite off their tongue while gnashing their teeth during a fit, in which case Jiache ST-6 would be included in a prescription for epilepsy in order to relax the jaw.

Summary of clinical application
Important local point for disorders of the jaw (pain, paralysis, tension, spasm), the teeth and gums, the face (facial paralysis, swelling of the cheek, inability to chew, inability to open the mouth following windstroke) and the neck (stiffness and pain, mumps).
Frequently joined to points such as Dìcāng ST-4, Dàyíng ST-5, Xiàguān ST-7 etc. for facial paralysis and facial pain.

# **ST-8** · TÓUWÉI (頭維) · *Head's Binding*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Touwei ST-8 is an important point to treat headaches. Located at the corner of the forehead, it is a meeting point of the Stomach channel with the Gall Bladder channel and the Yang Linking vessel. This meeting of three channels which have such influence on the head is reflected in the name of this point ‘Head’s Binding’. The Stomach channel belongs to yangming which rules the forehead, the Gall Bladder channel belongs to shaoyang which rules the temporal region, whilst the Yang Linking vessel links all the yang channels of the body including the Governing vessel and the Bladder channel which rule the vertex. Whilst the forte of Touwei ST-8 is the treatment of frontal headaches, with different needle direction it may also be used for temporal and vertex headaches.

Touwei ST-8 is particularly indicated in headaches and eye disorders due to wind, whether exterior pathogenic wind invading the channels of the head, or internally generated wind. As far as exterior headaches are concerned, although it is suitable for both wind-cold and wind-heat, many classics stress its use in the treatment of splitting headaches with bursting eye pain, symptoms more usually associated with wind-heat. Heat is a yang pathogen and its nature is to flare upwards and expand, obstructing the collaterals and leading to a distending and splitting sensation of the head. In the treatment of headache accompanied by pain or twitching of the eyes, Touwei ST‑8 is frequently combined in classical prescriptions with Zanzhu BL-2. Touwei ST-8 is also indicated for severe headache accompanied by vomiting, and is especially suitable for migraine headache with nausea or vomiting and dimness of vision or bursting pain of the eyes. The ability of Touwei ST-8 to clear internally generated wind from the head is reflected not only in its use for this kind of headache, but also for dizziness and hemiplegia.

Summary of clinical application
An important point for headache (meeting point of the Stomach and Gall Bladder channels and the Yang Linking vessel). Especially (needled anteriorly) for frontal and wind-heat headaches and migraines (with splitting sensation, bursting eye pain, dimness of vision, vomiting), but also (with different needling direction) for vertex and temporal headaches and headaches of any aetiology.

# **ST-9** · RÉNYÍNG (人迎) · *Man's Welcome*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Rényíng ST-9 is also known by its alternative name Tianwuhui (Heaven's Five Meetings). It is one of five points known as 'window of heaven' (literally 'five regions of the window of heaven') points in the Spiritual Pivot5 which states "headache due to rebellion of yang, fullness of the chest with difficulty in breathing, choose Rényíng ST-9". Located in the pivotal neck region, Rényíng ST-9 dramatically illustrates the characteristic ability of this group of points to re-establish harmony in the flow of qi between the body and the head. The rebellion of qi, which arises when the qi in the lower regions is disordered and chaotic, may manifest in various ways. In the head it gives rise to headache, dizziness and redness of the face; in the neck region it stagnates giving rise to scrofula and goitre; in the middle and upper jiao it injures the normal descent of Stomach and Lung qi and gives rise to vomiting, sudden turmoil disorder, wheezing, asthma and fullness of the chest.

According to Zhou Zhi-cong's commentary on the above passage from the Spiritual Pivot, the condition known as inversion qi (disordered, chaotic and rebellious qi) underlies the clinical manifestations of all the points of the window of heaven. One of the manifestations of inversion qi is sudden acute pain, and this echoes the important modern use of Rényíng ST-9 for acute lumbar sprain, as well as sprain and severe pain in any region of the body. The ability of Rényíng ST-9 to reorder rebellion and upsurge of qi also explains its strong action in reducing hypertension.

According to the chapter 'Discourse On the Seas' of the Spiritual Pivot6 Rényíng ST-9 (along with Shānzhōng REN-17, Yǎmén DU-15 and Dàzhuī DU-14) is a point of the 'sea of qi'. This passage gives the following indications for insufficiency and excess of the sea of qi "When the sea of qi is in excess there is fullness in the chest, urgent breathing and a red complexion. When the sea of qi is insufficient, there is scanty energy insufficient for speech". The dual and overlapping properties of Rényíng ST-9 as a point of the sea of qi and a point of the window of heaven underline its importance in harmonising and redistributing disordered qi in the body.

As long ago as the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic, observation and palpation of the pulse at Rényíng ST-9 was considered an important diagnostic method. The Essential Questions7 in discussing obstructed urination describes a pattern of "heat in the body like charcoal, the neck and chest are obstructed as if separated, a restless and abundant pulse at Rényíng ST-9 and dyspnoea with counterflow qi". Elsewhere in the Essential Questions great diagnostic significance is ascribed to the relative strengths of the pulses at the wrist and at Rényíng ST-9, whilst Zhang Zhong-jing refers to three methods of pulse diagnosis (Rényíng ST-9 in the upper, the wrist pulse in the middle and Chōngyáng ST-42 in the lower). Because of the complications inherent in these methods, they were abandoned relatively early in the history of Chinese medicine in favour of focusing on the wrist pulse.

Summary of clinical application
Window of heaven and sea of qi point for headache, dizziness, red face, vomiting and asthma.
For acute lumbar sprain and any acute pain, needled bilaterally or on the affected side.
For hypertension.
