# **SJ-13** · NĀOHUÌ (臑會) · *Upper Arm Meeting*
## What is the location and special properties of this point?
?
**Location:** On the upper arm, where the line drawn between Tiānjǐng SJ-10 and Jiānliáo SJ-14 meets the posterior border of the deltoid muscle, approximately two thirds of the distance between these two points.

**Notes:** i. Locate in the depression within the triceps muscle, posterior to the shaft of the humerus (between the muscle bellies of the long and lateral heads of the triceps); ii. Although most sources specify both a distance of 3 cun from Jiānliáo SJ-14 and a location at the posterior border of the deltoid muscle, these do not usually correspond. In practice, palpate the region of this point to find the most tender location.

**Special Properties:**
- Meeting point of the Sanjiao channel and the Yang Linking vessel
