# **SI-1** · SHÀOZÉ (少澤) · *Lesser Marsh*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Shàozé SI-1 is the jing-well point of the Small Intestine channel. In common with all the jing-well points of the yang channels, it has a strong action on clearing heat from the opposite end of the channel in the head. Branches of the Small Intestine channel ascend to the ear, the inner and outer canthus, and alongside the nose, whilst its paired Heart channel opens into the tongue. Shàozé SI-1, therefore, has a strong effect on clearing heat or pathologically ascending yang from the eyes, ears, nose and tongue, as well as the mouth and throat, and is indicated for such excess disorders as red eyes, tinnitus and deafness, erosion and ulceration of the tongue, painful obstruction of the throat, mouth ulcers, drooling and nosebleed.

According to the Classic of Difficulties2 the jing-well points are indicated for fullness below the Heart. Whilst the region 'below the Heart' specifically refers to the upper epigastrium, like many of the jing-well points, Shàozé SI-1 treats fullness in the chest region as a whole and is indicated for oppression and pain of the chest and Heart, cold sensation below the Heart and pain of the lateral costal region.

In clinical practice however, Shàozé SI-1 is principally used for swelling and abscess of the breasts and disorders of lactation. Absence of lactation is primarily differentiated into two types, insufficiency of qi and blood resulting in inadequate production of milk, or stagnation of Liver qi which leads to obstruction and coagulation of milk in the breasts. The Small Intestine primary channel descends to the centre of the chest at Shānzhōng REN-17, and these two points are frequently combined to treat insufficiency or total absence of lactation. Breast abscess is usually due to Liver or Stomach fire or transformation of exterior pathogens to heat. In combination with suitable points, Shàozé SI-1 may be used in any of these two patterns.

Finally, in common with the other jing-well points, Shàozé SI-1 is used to revive consciousness and is indicated for loss of consciousness from windstroke.

Summary of clinical application
Clears heat from the upper portion of the channel: headache, dizziness, superficial visual obstruction, red eyes, nosebleed, deafness, tinnitus, throat painful obstruction, curled tongue, stiff tongue, heat in the mouth, erosion of the mouth, mouth ulcers, drooling.
As the jing-well point restores consciousness and treats disorders of the chest: loss of consciousness from windstroke, cold sensation below the Heart, Heart pain, oppression and pain of the chest, pain of the lateral costal region, cough.
Most commonly used clinically for swelling of the breast, breast abscess and absence of lactation (often with Shanzhong REN-17).

# **SI-10** · NĀOSHŪ (臑俞) · *Upper Arm Shu*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Nāoshū SI-10 is a commonly used point for pain and stiffness of the shoulder, especially its posterior aspect, and allows deep penetration into the joint. Its influence on the shoulder is augmented by the fact that Nāoshū SI-10 is also a meeting point of the Yang Motility and Yang Linking vessels, which traverse the posterior (Yang Linking) and the superior and anterior (Yang Motility) portions of the shoulder. In clinical practice Nāoshū SI-10 is often used in combination with points such as Jiānyú L.I.-15 and Jiānliáo SJ-14.

Summary of clinical application
Frequently used local point for disorders of the shoulder, scapula and upper arm. Meeting point of three channels which traverse the shoulder joint, the Small Intestine channel (posterior shoulder), the Yang Linking vessel (posterior shoulder) and the Yang Motility vessel (anterior and superior shoulder).

# **SI-11** · TIĀNZŌNG (天宗) · *Heavenly Gathering*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The indications of Tiānzōng SI-11 reflect both its location and its ability to move qi and unbind the chest. It is an important point for pain of the scapular region whether due to sprain, painful obstruction, overuse, poor posture, Liver qi stagnation or referred pain from Gall Bladder disease, in which cases it is usually found to be acutely tender on palpation. Lying behind the breast, it is also used in combination with points such as Shàozé SI-1 and Shānzhōng REN-17 for a wide variety of disorders of the breast including pain, lumps and insufficient lactation.

Summary of clinical application
Commonly used local point for any pain of the scapular region (whether due to sprain, painful obstruction, overuse, poor posture, Liver qi stagnation or referred pain from Gall Bladder disease).
For breast disorders including pain, lumps and insufficient lactation.

# **SI-12** · BǏNGFĒNG (秉風) · *Grasping the Wind*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Bǐngfēng SI-12 is a meeting point of the Small Intestine channel with the Large Intestine, Sanjiao and Gall Bladder channels, all of which traverse the scapular and shoulder regions and the neck. As its name 'Grasping Wind' (and by implication controlling wind) implies, Bǐngfēng SI-12 is a useful local point to invigorate these channels and expel pathogenic wind which has lodged in the muscles of the shoulder and scapula. Although most classical and contemporary sources recommend this point for local disorders only, the Ming dynasty classic Investigation Into Points Along the Channels suggests a broader action of expelling wind and recommends the use of Bǐngfēng SI-12 "when the interstices and pores do not close properly, wind pathogen easily enters [resulting in] cough with stubborn phlegm".

Summary of clinical application
Local point for disorders of the shoulder, scapula and neck, especially when due to wind invasion.

# **SI-13** · QŪYUÁN (曲垣) · *Crooked Wall*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion emphasises the use of Qūyuán SI-13 in the treatment of painful obstruction of the shoulder that has persisted and transformed into heat with contraction, pain and oppressive sensation. This transformation of wind, damp or cold into heat is a manifestation of the law of 'similar transformation' expounded by Liu Wan-su (see Yīnlíngquán SP-9).

Summary of clinical application
Both Qūyuán SI-13 and Jiānwàishū SI-14 are indicated for local disorders of the shoulder and scapula, with Jiānwàishū SI-14 additionally indicated for chills and fever accompanied by neck rigidity and inability to turn the head, and generalised painful obstruction.

# **SI-16** · TIĀNCHUĀNG (天窗) · *Heavenly Window*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Tiānchuāng SI-16 is one of ten points listed in Chapter 2 of the Spiritual Pivot that have come to be known as Window of Heaven points. As a group, these ten points have the action of regulating rebellious and chaotic (inversion) qi. Tiānchuāng SI-16 illustrates many of the characteristic actions of these points in its ability to i. treat goitre and throat disorders, ii. treat headache and heat and swelling of the face and cheek, iii. treat disorders of the sense organs - in this case the ears, iv. treat sudden onset of disorders - in this case loss of voice. In addition, like two other points from this group (Tiānzhù BL-10 and Tiānfǔ LU-3) Tiānchuāng SI-16 treats disorders characterised in the classical texts as seeing or communicating with ghosts and therefore attributed to some form of demonic possession. In terms of modern medicine these indications refer to various forms of severe mental disorder including schizophrenia. For a fuller discussion see the Window of Heaven points.

Sun Si-miao, the famous 7th century physician, particularly emphasised the use of moxibustion (fifty cones) at this point for loss of speech and hemiplegia.

Summary of clinical application
Window of Heaven point: treats i. goitre and throat disorders (hoarseness, throat pain) ii. headache and heat and swelling of the face and cheek, iii. disorders of the sense organs - in this case the ears (deafness, tinnitus, ear pain), iv. sudden onset of disorders (sudden loss of voice).
Treats mania-depression and ‘manic ghost talk’.

# **SI-17** · TIĀNRÓNG (天容) · *Heavenly Appearance*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
In the Spiritual Pivot Tianrong was classified as a point of the Gall Bladder channel, whilst in the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion it was listed as belonging to the Sanjiao channel. It was not until the 10th century classic Secrets of a Frontier Official, that Tianrong was finally ascribed to the Small Intestine channel.

The point Tiānróng SI-17 is discussed in the chapter 'Needling Methods and Upright and Pathogenic Qi' in the Spiritual Pivot6. According to Qi Bo, the Yellow Emperor's adviser, this point should be needled for "great rebellion of yang qi which rises to fill the chest causing congestion of the chest, agitation and raising of the shoulders ... dyspnoea and wheezing with inability to sit or lie down. In such an illness there is aversion to dust and smoke [as it causes] breathing difficulty as if the throat is blocked", a clear reference to an acute attack of asthma. He compares the speed at which needling this point takes effect to "wiping away the dust".

Tiānróng SI-17 is one of ten points listed in Chapter Two of the Spiritual Pivot that have come to be known as Window of Heaven points. It clearly exemplifies the character and action of these points in its ability to regulate rebellious and chaotic (inversion) qi. Tiānróng SI-17 shares with these points the ability to i. treat scrofula and goitre due to stagnation of qi and phlegm in the pivotal neck region, as well as throat disorders, ii. descend rebellious qi, in this case of the Lung and Stomach manifesting as fullness of the chest with difficulty in breathing, cough, asthma, wheezing and vomiting, and iii. treat disorders of the sense organs, in this case the ears (tinnitus and deafness). See Window of Heaven for a fuller discussion.

Summary of clinical application
Window of Heaven point: i. treats scrofula and goitre due to stagnation of qi and phlegm in the pivotal neck region, as well as throat disorders (painful obstruction, swelling and pain of the neck with inability to speak), ii. descends rebellious qi, in this case of the Lung and Stomach manifesting as fullness of the chest, difficulty in breathing, cough, chest pain, wheezing and vomiting, iii. treats disorders of the sense organs, in this case the ears (tinnitus and deafness).

# **SI-18** · QUÁNLIÁO (顴髎) · *Cheek Bone Crevice*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
The location of Quánliáo SI-18 renders it an important and commonly-used point in the treatment of facial disorders due to either interior or exterior wind, and it is indicated for facial paralysis, trigeminal neuralgia, twitching of the eyelids and toothache of the upper jaw. In the treatment of the first two conditions it is often joined to points such as Yíngxiāng L.I.-20, Dìcāng ST-4 and Jiáchē ST-6 by transverse needling.

Summary of clinical application
Local point for facial paralysis, trigeminal neuralgia, twitching of the eyelids and toothache of the upper jaw. For facial paralysis and trigeminal neuralgia it is often joined to points such as Yíngxiāng L.I.-20, Dìcāng ST-4 and Jiáchē ST-6 by the transverse needling method.

# **SI-19** · TĪNGGŌNG (聽宮) · *Palace of Hearing*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
There are three points anterior to the tragus of the ear, Ěrmén SJ-21 superiorly, Tīnggōng SI-19 in the middle, and Tīnghuì GB-2 inferiorly. All are frequently employed for the treatment of a wide variety of ear disorders, including tinnitus, deafness, pain, itching and discharge. Due to the close proximity of these points and the similar indications for each, it is difficult to distinguish between them clinically. It is worth noting however that Tīnggōng SI-19 has a secondary action of calming the spirit, whilst Tīnghuì GB-2 is the most effective to treat painful disorders of the surrounding area including the jaw and teeth. If it is necessary to needle points around the ear regularly, then these three points should be alternated.

In current practice, where points are numbered, it is easy to remember the relative locations of Ěrmén SJ-21 (Gate of the Ear), Tīnggōng SI-19 (Palace of Hearing) and Tīnghuì GB-2 (Meeting of Hearing), the highest point number being the uppermost point. In China, which has no tradition of numbering the points, one way of recalling the order of their location was by the image of entering through the 'gate' of the 'palace' to convene a 'meeting'.

Summary of clinical application
Much used for all ear disorders including deafness, tinnitus and purulent discharge.

# **SI-3** · HÒUXĪ (後谿) · *Back Stream*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Hòuxī SI-3 is both the shu-stream point of the Small Intestine channel, which is interiorly-exteriorly coupled with the Heart channel, and the confluent point of the Governing vessel. Most of its actions and indications can be explained by its relationship to these three channels. In clinical practice Hòuxī SI-3 can be seen to have four main spheres of action.

Firstly it is an important point to treat pain, stiffness and contraction along the course of its related channels. Taiyang (Small Intestine and Bladder) channel traverses the occiput, neck, scapula and paravertebral regions, whilst the Governing vessel ascends along the spinal column from the coccyx to the head. According to the Classic of Difficulties3 the shu-stream points are indicated for "heaviness of the body and pain of the joints". Hòuxī SI-3 is an essential distal point in the treatment of occipital headache (although also used for one-sided and bilateral headache) and stiffness and pain of the neck, whether acute or chronic and whether due to exterior pathogenic factors or interior disharmony. It has a significant influence on the spine as a whole, and is an important and frequently used distal point for pain of the upper spine and scapula, as well as in the treatment of acute lumbar sprain on the midline or lateral lumbar region. Hòuxī SI-3 is also important for disorders of the finger joints, especially the little and ring fingers, and may be needled deeply towards Sānjiān L.I.-3 when all four fingers are affected. Hòuxī SI-3 is equally important in the treatment of pain and contraction of the arm, elbow and shoulder.

The second principal action of Hòuxī SI-3 is to dispel febrile disease. This may be explained by the fact that the taiyang Small Intestine channel belongs to fire, taiyang is the most exterior of the six channels, and the Governing vessel governs all the yang channels and hence the exterior portion of the body as a whole. Hòuxī SI-3 is especially indicated in the treatment of malaria, and for when attack by exterior pathogenic wind-cold or wind-heat gives rise to chills and fever accompanied by severe neck pain or pain of the spine. A further reflection of its heat clearing action is in the treatment of night sweating, particularly in combination with Yīnxī HE-6.

In the Ode of the Obstructed River the use of Hòuxī SI-3 is referred to as one of 'the eight therapeutic methods'. In this description of the application of the eight confluent points of the extraordinary vessels to affect specific symptoms and areas of the body, Hòuxī SI-3 is indicated for diseases of the Governing vessel and for mania-depression. The third action of Hòuxī SI-3, therefore, is in calming the spirit and treating both mania-depression and epilepsy. The former is due to phlegm and phlegm-heat which disturb and agitate the spirit, and the latter to disturbance of the spirit and brain by pathogenic wind and phlegm. According to Sun Si-miao, the famous 7th century physician "the head is the supreme leader, the place where man's spirit concentrates"4, whilst in the 16th century, Li Shi-zhen stated "the brain is the residence of the original spirit". Since the Small Intestine channel is interiorly-exteriorly related to the Heart which stores the spirit, and Hòuxī SI-3 is the confluent point of the Governing vessel which enters the brain, this point has long been considered important in the treatment of epilepsy. The Song More Precious Than Jade, for example, recommends it for the five types of epilepsy.

Fourthly, in common with points Shàozé SI-1 and Qiángǔ SI-2, Hòuxī SI-3 is able to clear both exterior and interior heat from the Small Intestine channel in the head (especially the ears and eyes) and to benefit the sensory orifices. It is thus indicated for disorders such as tinnitus and deafness, superficial visual obstruction, redness, pain and swelling of the eyes with lacrimation, nosebleed, and pain and swelling of the cheeks.

Summary of clinical application
Important distal point for disorders of the neck, scapula, upper back, shoulder, arm and hand.
Used for acute lumbar sprain on the midline or lateral lumbar region.
Clears heat and reduces fever: malaria, night sweating, chills and fever, febrile disease with absence of sweating.
Treats epilepsy and mania-depression.
Treats the upper portion of the channel: deafness, tinnitus, redness, pain and swelling of the eyes and lacrimation, nosebleed, toothache, redness and swelling of the throat and cheek.

# **SI-4** · WÀNGǓ (腕骨) · *Wrist Bone*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Wàngǔ SI-4 is the yuan-source point of the Small Intestine channel. Its main clinical application is in the treatment of contraction, stiffness and pain along the entire length of the channel including the hand, elbow, arm, shoulder, neck and back. It is one of the main points (along with Yángxī L.I.-5, Zhōngzhǔ SJ-3 and Zhīzhèng SI-7) to treat disorders of all the five fingers, especially when characterised by contraction and pain.

Wàngǔ SI-4 has a specific effect in the treatment of swelling at the opposite end of the channel, especially the neck, cheek and submandibular region. Like all the previous points of this channel it is also indicated in the treatment of tinnitus, reflecting the pathways of the Small Intestine primary and sinew channels which enter the ear. This is an example of the use of acupuncture points to treat disorders of the channel rather than underlying zangfu disharmony, and Wàngǔ SI-4 may therefore be used in tinnitus due to any aetiology. Wàngǔ SI-4 is specifically indicated in combination (see below) to treat pain and swelling of the submandibular region radiating to the ear and giving rise to tinnitus.

Finally, Wàngǔ SI-4 has been found to be empirically effective in the treatment of different kinds of jaundice, whether due to damp-heat or cold damp, as well as pain of the lateral costal region with inability to catch the breath. This action cannot easily be explained, either by reference to the channel pathway or to the functions of the Small Intestine.

# **SI-5** · YÁNGGǓ (陽谷) · *Yang Valley*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Yánggǔ SI-5 is the fire and jing-river point of the Small Intestine channel. Unlike the more distal points of the channel, it has relatively less action on the channel as a whole, in other words it is less used to treat disorders of the hand, arm or shoulder, but focuses rather on the eyes, ears and jaw. As a fire point it is able to clear heat and swelling and soothe contraction in these regions. It is specifically indicated for swelling of the neck and submandibular region, lockjaw, contraction of the tongue in babies, tongue thrusting (where the tongue is repeatedly thrust out of the mouth like a snake's tongue) and toothache. Whilst most classical sources recommend this point for toothache of the upper jaw, Sun Si-miao the famous 7th century physician incorporated it in prescriptions for toothache of both the upper and lower jaw.

As the fire point of the Small Intestine channel (interiorly-exteriorly related to the Heart channel) Yánggǔ SI-5 is able to clear fire from the Heart and calm the spirit and is indicated for mania and 'mad walking'.

Yánggǔ SI-5 is indicated (and appears in combination with distal points of the Bladder channel) for haemorrhoids.

Finally, in learning the names of the points of the yang channels at the wrist, it is helpful to remember the similarity between their names: Yángxī L.I.-5 (Yang Stream), Yánggǔ SI-5 (Yang Valley) and Yángchí SJ-4 (Yang Pool).

# **SI-6** · YǍNGLǍO (養老) · *Support the Aged*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Summary of clinical application
Xi-cleft point for acute pain: shoulder pain, pain of the shoulder as if it were broken, pain of the upper arm as if it were dislocated, stiffness and pain of the shoulder and back, numbness of the shoulder and arm, redness and swelling of the exterior aspect of the elbow, heaviness and pain of the lumbar region, difficulty in sitting and rising, contraction of the sinews, painful obstruction of the foot with inability to extend and flex.
Treats the eyes (principally deficiency-type disorders): dimness of vision, blurred vision, eye pain.

# **SI-7** · ZHĪZHÈNG (支正) · *Branch of the Upright*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Zhīzhèng SI-7 has three main actions. Firstly, since the Small Intestine belongs to taiyang channel (the most exterior of the six channels and thus the first to be attacked by exterior pathogenic factors) Zhīzhèng SI-7 in common with many points of the Small Intestine channel is able to release the exterior. It is primarily used in cases of exterior heat pathogen giving rise to febrile disease, and is especially indicated when the onset is characterised by neck and lumbar pain.

Secondly, Zhīzhèng SI-7 is the luo-connecting point of the Small Intestine channel from where the Small Intestine luo-connecting channel spreads to join with the Heart channel. This is reflected in the name of this point 'Branch of the Upright', the 'upright' being the Heart channel. The Guide to the Classics of Acupuncture states "the luo-connecting points are located between two channels ... if they are punctured, symptoms of the interiorly-exteriorly related channels can be treated"5. Zhīzhèng SI-7 has a pronounced effect on regulating and calming the spirit and is indicated for mania-depression, fear and fright, and sadness and anxiety. The Methods of Acupuncture and Moxibustion from the Golden Mirror of Medicine more specifically recommends Zhīzhèng SI-7 for depression and knotting of all the seven emotions.

Thirdly Zhīzhèng SI-7 is able to regulate the Small Intestine channel in the region of the head (headache and dizziness), eyes (blurred vision, superficial visual obstruction, visual dizziness), elbow (contraction of the elbow), and especially the fingers (severe pain of all the fingers, inability to grip firmly, inability to make a fist). The principle of selecting distal points to treat disorders of the limbs, trunk and head is fundamental to acupuncture practice, and since the twelve primary channels all flow to or from the hands and feet, there is a profusion of distal points to choose from. In the treatment of disorders of the hands and feet themselves, however, there are by definition no distal points, and there are relatively few proximal points that affect these areas. Zhīzhèng SI-7 is therefore notable for its action on the fingers and hand.

Finally the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion gives specific indications for excess and deficiency of the luo-connecting points. In the case of Zhīzhèng SI-7, these are slackness of the joints and inability to move the elbow (excess); warts (deficiency).

# **SI-8** · XIǍOHǍI (小海) · *Small Sea*
## What is the TCM theoretical understanding of this point?
?
Xiǎohǎi SI-8 is the he-sea and earth point of the Small Intestine channel. Despite these important characteristics, it is a relatively infrequently used point, reflected by its appearance in very few classical combinations. It is indicated for many different kinds of swelling involving the gums, throat, cheek, elbow and axilla, as well as scrofula of the neck or axilla. Clinically, however, it is primarily used for pain of the scapula and the postero-lateral aspect of the shoulder, arm and elbow. Like Zhīzhèng SI-7, Xiǎohǎi SI-8 is also able to regulate its coupled Heart zang and is indicated for such disorders as epilepsy, tongue thrusting (where the tongue is repeatedly thrust out of the mouth like a snake's tongue), mad walking and agitation of the Heart.

Finally it is worth noting that despite being the he-sea point of the Small Intestine, Xiǎohǎi SI-8 has no significant action on its respective fu. This reflects the essential contradiction that whilst the Small and Large Intestine fu are located in the lower jiao, their channels run along the upper limb. As a consequence, points of these channels have relatively little action on the fu, and disorders of the Small Intestine are rather treated by points such as Xiàjùxū ST-39 or Xiǎochángshū BL-27, the lower he-sea and back-shu points of the Small Intestine respectively.

Summary of clinical application
Clears heat and swelling from the upper portion of the channel: scrofula, swelling and pain of the throat, swelling of the cheek, swelling of the gums, swelling and pain of the elbow and axilla, toothache, dizziness, headache, deafness.
Clinically mostly used to treat disorders of the neck, scapula, shoulder, arm and elbow.
