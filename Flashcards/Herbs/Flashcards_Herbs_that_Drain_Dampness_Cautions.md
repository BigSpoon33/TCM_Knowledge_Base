# **Dōng Guā Zǐ (冬瓜子)** · *Benincasae Semen* · winter melon seed, wax gourd seed, benincasa
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Zhu Dan-Xi observes:

Winter melon has a nature which urgently mobilizes. When Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians [sixth-century text] says that it separates and disperses toxic qi, this is utilizing its urgent, mobilizing nature. It should not be taken by those with chronic illness or yin deficiency.

In Essentials of the Materia Medica, however, Wang Ang disagrees:

Winter melon is something consumed almost daily as a food, and of all the melons, it particularly feels beneficial to people. Furthermore, its flavor is sweet and not acrid; how can its nature be seen as urgently mobilizing?!

In Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica, Huang Gong Xiu weighs in on the argument:

Since Wang Ang had previously stated that it alleviates thirst and reduces swelling, and then says that its nature is not mobilizing and its consumption is greatly beneficial-is he not contradicting himself?
