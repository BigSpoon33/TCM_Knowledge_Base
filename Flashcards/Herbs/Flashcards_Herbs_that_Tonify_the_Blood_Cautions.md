# **Dāng Guī (当归)** · *Angelicae Sinensis Radix* · Tangkuei, Chinese Angelica Root
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in those with diarrhea or abdominal fullness due to abundant dampness.
Acrid and warm, although it tonifies and invigorates the blood, in the end its nature is to promote the movement of blood and mobilize the blood, thus it can cause loose stools. Its qi is incompatible with the Stomach qi, thus it should not be used if the Intestines and Stomach are weak, with loose stools, aversion to food, loss of appetite, or indigestion. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)

"If wind-cold has not cleared, and symptoms of the externally-contracted pathogenic influence are still visible, such as chills and fever, its use is forbidden." (Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica)

# **Shu Di Huang (熟地黄)** · *Rehmanniae Radix Preparata* · Cooked rehmannia root, prepared Chinese foxglove root
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
This is a very cloying and rich substance that readily leads to stagnation of dampness and impedes digestion. It is contraindicated in those with qi stagnation and profuse phlegm, fullness, and pain in the abdomen, reduced appetite, and diarrhea. See below for toxicity.

Traditional Contraindications

"Do not allow it to contact bronze or iron implements, or it will cause the Kidneys to waste, whiten the hair, and injure the nutritive and protective levels." (Grandfather Lei's Discussion of Herb Preparation)

"Because it can obstruct the diaphragm in those with qi constraint, one should deliberate before using it [in those cases]." (Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica)

Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica explains that, despite its gentle warmth, all forms of rehmannia are relatively cool and have a cloying effect on the diaphragm, so that in cases of postpartum loss of appetite, or diarrhea, even though there may be fever, or pain due to retained lochia, it cannot be used-mistaken use will cause ceaseless diarrhea; whenever the diaphragm area has excessive phlegm and the movement of the qi dynamic is poor such that ascent and descent are plugged, herbs should unblock rather than cause stagnation, so in these cases, rehmannia is forbidden in decoctions or pills. If it absolutely must be used, then a bit of cinnamon heart [a form of *Cinnamomi Cortex* (rou gui)] can be added. In a phlegm pattern, if it must be used and cannot be done without, then fry it with ginger juice.
