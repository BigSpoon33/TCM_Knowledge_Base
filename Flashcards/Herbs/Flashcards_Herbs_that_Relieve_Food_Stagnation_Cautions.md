# **Lái Fú Zǐ (莱菔子)** · *Raphani Semen* · Radish Seed, Raphanus
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Inappropriate in the absence of food stagnation, phlegm, or other form of accumulation. Because it consumes the qi, it should not be taken long term.  Should not be used together with *Ginseng Radix* (人参 rén shēn), *Rehmanniae Radix Preparata* (熟地黄 shú dì huáng), or *Polygoni Multiflori Radix Preparata* (制何首乌 zhì hé shǒu wū).

*Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica* cautions that it is "even more rapid in reducing phlegm and driving qi downward [than radish itself]. When deficient or weak patients consume it, qi becomes difficult to distribute, affecting breathing." The *Materia Medica of Combinations* states that it is contraindicated when taking tonics.

# **Mài Yá (麥芽)** · *Hordei Fructus Germinatus* · Barley Sprouts
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
- **Contraindications:** Contraindicated in women during lactation, except in a very low dosage (up to 9g).
- Li Shi-Zhen cautioned:
  - It will only help the digestion in those with accumulation.
  - In those without accumulation, if it is taken over a long period of time, it will reduce their primal qi: one must not be ignorant of this fact.
  - If it is to be taken over a long period of time, it must be combined with such herbs as Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu)-then will be no harm.
- The comments of Zhang Jie-Bin are in a similar vein:
  - In chronic illness with reduced food intake, its grain qi can be utilized to unbind the Stomach.
  - Those with primal qi deficiency should not overuse it, as it reduces Kidney [qi].
  - It also excels at promoting labor and dropping the fetus.
  - Only [with a dosage of] 60g can it reduce breast swelling.
  - When it exhausts and disperses qi and blood in this fashion, why is it used so much in every prescription for weak Spleen and Stomach with undigested food and drink?
  - Pregnant women should not overuse it.

# **Shān Zhā (山楂)** · *Crataegi Fructus* · crataegus fruit, hawthorn fruit
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
- Use with caution in those with weakness or deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach.
- Large doses are absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy, as this can lead to fetal death.

Its nature conquers and cuts down; if Stomach patients have no food accumulation, or if the Spleen is deficient and cannot transport and transform, or those with no appetite will consume it, it will conversely conquer and curtail the generative qi of the Spleen and Stomach, causing restless irritability and an increase in hunger. If the Spleen and Stomach are deficient, but there is also accumulated stagnation, it should be used together with herbs that tonify the qi, but should not be overly used. It can also injure the teeth. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)
