## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated during pregnancy. Should not be used for conditions that are not associated with heat from excess, nor in cases of Spleen or Stomach deficiency.
Contraindicated in those with cold from deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach, and for infants with diarrhea due to poor digestion of milk. [Li] Dong-Yuan stated: 'Bovis Calculus (*niu huang*) enters the Liver to treat the sinews; when wind-stroke enters the yin organs [themselves], it can be used to enter the bones and search out the wind. If [wind-stroke] enters the yang organs or the channels, mistaken use will conversely guide the wind into the bones, from which-like oil seeping into flour-it will be impossible to extricate it: the injury will be deep. It is particularly forbidden in those with constitutionally accumulated deficiency, who suddenly [collapse] in abandonment. [Zhang] Jing-Yue called this "false wind".'
