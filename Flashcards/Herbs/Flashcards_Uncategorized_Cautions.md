# **Xin Yi Hua (辛夷花)** · *Magnoliae Flos* · Magnolia Flower
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in cases of fire from yin deficiency.

Its acrid, aromatic, piercing, and mobilizing nature makes it forbidden in qi-deficient patients with exposure to wind cold causing nasal congestion; those patients with headache from blood deficiency with accumulated fire or toothache from Stomach fire who take it will become worse. The hairy texture of the floral envelope can enter the Lungs and cause cough. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)

Chen Shi-Duo notes:
Acrid, dispersing substances, if used excessively, will injure the true qi: they can be used temporarily, but not for an extended period. In summary, once the illness is expelled then stop [using the herb]; do not be tempted to repeatedly apply it just because of its great efficacy. This caution is not limited to Magnoliae Flos (*xin yi*).
