# **Yuǎn Zhì (遠志)** · *Polygalae Radix* · Polygala Root, Chinese senega, Thinleaf milkwort
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
This herb is relatively warm and drying, and, unless prepared, can be irritating when ingested. Contraindicated for those with yin deficiency with heat signs as well as those with peptic ulcers or gastritis. See Toxicity below.
- According to some traditional sources, this herb antagonizes Chrysanthemi Flos (ju hua).
- Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic Materia Medica observes that it is quite oily in form and nature, and should not be taken by those with Intestinal leakage causing diarrhea, or by those with excessive phlegm around the diaphragm. 
- Its standard contraindications are [in those cases of] "repeated erections", "Kidney patients with heat", and summerheat dampness causing diarrhea.
- The references to repeated erections and Kidney patients with heat reflect the views of earlier materia medica texts that Platycladi Semen (bai zi ren) could treat cold in the Kidneys and Bladder, and stimulate male sexual function.
- Medicinal Combining adds: "Forbidden in four situations: those with excessive phlegm, Lung qi floating upward, loose stools, and Stomach deficiency with an urge to vomit."
- According to some traditional sources, this herb counteracts Margarita (zhen zhu) and Veratri nigri Radix et Rhizoma (li lu).
- This has no tonifying property, so for patterns of deficiency involving stagnation, use it together with herbs that nourish the blood and tonify the qi; to reestablish harmonious communication between the Heart and Kidneys, it provides guidance and dissemination to attain grand harmony. It cannot be used in a large dosage, or by itself. If one who is purely deficient, without obstruction, should mistakenly ingest it, it will give him heart pain with a suspended, empty sensation. When the Heart channel has fire from excess, one should use Coptidis Rhizoma (huang lian) and Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) [in combination with it; and when there is fire] it is forbidden to use it together with Ginseng Radix (ren shen), Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu), or other herbs that tonify the yang qi [as one would otherwise often do].
