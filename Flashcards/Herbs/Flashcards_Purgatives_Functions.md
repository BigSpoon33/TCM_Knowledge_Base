Drains heat and purges accumulations: for high fever, profuse sweating, thirst, constipation, abdominal distention and pain, delirium, yellow tongue coating, and a full pulse. This presentation is referred to either as Intestinal heat excess or the yang brightness organ-stage of the six stages of disease.
    - With *Natrii Sulfas* (mang xiao), *Magnoliae officinalis* Cortex (hou po), and *Aurantii Fructus immaturus* (zhi shi) for unremitting high fever, delirious speech, and constipation, as in Major Order the Qi Decoction (*da cheng qi tang*) and Cool the Diaphragm Powder (*liang ge san*).
    - When taken in a small dose and combined with such herbs as *Cannabis Semen* (huo ma ren) and *Armeniacae Semen* (xing ren) in pill form, it can be used for moderate constipation, as in Hemp Seed Pills (*ma zi ren wan*).
    - With *Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata* (zhi fu zi) for constipation due to cold accumulation, as in Rhubarb and Aconite Accessory Root Decoction (*da huang fu zi tang*).
    - With *Cinnamomi Cortex* (rou gui) for chronic constipation.
- Drains fire: for fire from excess leading to intense fever, sore throat, hot, swollen, and painful eyes, or fire toxin sores due to heat excess obstructing the blood level. Particularly useful when these problems are accompanied by constipation.
    - With *Coptidis Rhizoma* (huang lian) for a feeling of fullness and distention due to heat accumulation.
    - Add *Scutellariae Radix* (huang qin) for vomiting blood or nosebleed due to chaotic movement of hot blood, as in Coptis Decoction to Resolve Toxicity (*huang lian jie du tang*).
    - With *Gardeniae Fructus* (zhi zi), *Scutellariae Radix* (huang qin), and *Forsythiae Fructus* (lian qiao) for strong pathogenic heat in the upper and middle burners, as in Cool the Diaphragm Powder (*liang ge san*).
    - With *Gentianae Radix* (long dan cao) and *Prunellae Spica* (xia ku cao) for Liver fire leading to headache and anger with constipation.
- Clears heat, transforms dampness, and promotes urination: for damp-heat leading to such problems as edema, jaundice, painful urinary dribbling, as well as acute, hot dysenteric disorders.
    - With *Artemisiae scopariae Herba* (yin chen) and *Gardeniae Fructus* (zhi zi) for jaundice and associated flank pain, as in Artemisia Yinchenhao Decoction (*yin chen hao tang*).
    - With *Kansui Radix* (gan sui) for accumulation of pathogenic heat and fluids in the chest and upper abdomen, as in Major Sinking Into the Chest Decoction (*da xian xiong tang*).
    - With *Plantaginis Semen* (che qian zi) and *Polygoni avicularis Herba* (bian xu) for hot painful urinary dribbling, as in Eight-Herb Powder for Rectification (*ba zheng san*).
- Drains heat from the blood: for blood in the stool either from bleeding hemorrhoids or heat accumulating in the Intestines. Also for chaotic movement of hot blood that overflows, manifested in vomiting blood or nosebleed accompanied by constipation. Can be powdered and administered orally for bleeding from the upper digestive tract. This is an important herb because it can stop bleeding without causing blood stasis.
    - With *Moutan Cortex* (mu dan pi) and *Persicae Semen* (tao ren) for Intestinal abscess, as in Rhubarb and Moutan Decoction (*da huang mu dan tang*).
- Invigorates the blood and dispels blood stasis: for amenorrhea, fixed abdominal masses, or fixed pain due to blood stasis. Also for blood stasis due to traumatic injury or Intestinal abscess. This is an important herb for treating both recent and long-term blood stasis as it can both eliminate static blood that is outside the vessels via the bowels, and clear the heat that often develops from stasis. It is used both internally and externally.
    - With *Cinnamomi Ramulus* (gui zhi) for blood stasis to simultaneously remove the stasis and unblock the flow of qi.
    - With *Angelicae sinensis Radix* (dang gui), *Persicae Semen* (tao ren), and *Carthami Flos* (hong hua) for blood stasis.
    - With *Hirudo* (shui zhi) and *Tabanus* (meng chong) to purge intense blood stasis.
- Clears heat and reduces fire toxicity: used either topically or internally for burns or skin lesions due to heat.
    - With calcined *Gypsum fibrosum* (duan shi gao) as a topical plaster for burns.
