# **Xiang Ru (香薷)** · *Moslae Herba* · Mosla, aromatic madder
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in cases of profuse sweating from exterior deficiency.

Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica provides excellent advice on the proper use of Moslae Herba (xiang ru):

Mistaken use of Moslae Herba (xiang ru) will injure the qi of the exterior. It is used in summertime conditions, but if the injury is from the heat of summer directly, Moslae Herba (xiang ru) is not suitable- this disorder requires acrid, cooling herbs. Likewise in the summer people might overeat or overexert themselves while exposed to high summer temperatures, which makes them sweat excessively; they become irritable and restless with wheezing and rapid breathing, and may have diarrhea or vomiting- yet this is not an exterior disorder, but an internal pathology best treated with Li Gao's Clear Summerheat and Augment the Qi Decoction or White Tiger Decoction (qing shu yi qi tang)or with Ginseng (bai hu jia ren shen tang), rather than with Moslae Herba (xiang ru), which would only weaken the exterior, allowing in even more heat.
