# **Bǔ Gǔ Zhī (补骨脂)** · *Psoraleae Fructus* · Malaytea Scurfpea Fruit
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in patterns of yin deficiency with heat signs or constipation. Although this herb can be hard on the Stomach, it is sometimes used, with caution, for cold from deficiency of the Stomach. See Toxicity below.

Traditional Contraindications

"Do not eat excessively [because they] disturb phlegm and thin mucus, making people nauseous so that they vomit water and food." (Important Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces)

"These are only appropriate for cold from deficiency, and should not be consumed by those with phlegm-fire or accumulated heat." (Detailed Materia Medica)

Its nature is drying and it assists fire; it is not to be taken when there is yin deficiency with fire blazing, excessive erections, spermatorrhea, blood in the urine, scanty, difficult urination, reddened eyes, bitter taste, dry tongue, and dry constipation, when internal heat causes thirst, or fire ascends causing indefinable epigastric discomfort, or damp-heat resulting in atrophy and weakness of the bones. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)

This book, and a number of other materia medica texts also state that Psoraleae Fructus (bu gu zhi) is contraindicated during pregnancy. However, in Readings in the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica, Chen Nian-Zu observes that "The reference to 'abortion' in the Materia Medica of the Kaibao Era meant that this could be used to treat someone about to miscarry a pregnancy, not that it can cause miscarriage!" Chen goes on to explain that in fact, it "greatly stabilizes the fetus." Modern Chinese gynecology concurs with Chen and regards this as an herb that is used to prevent miscarriage due to instability of the Kidney yang.

According to some traditional sources, they should not be taken with strong tea.
