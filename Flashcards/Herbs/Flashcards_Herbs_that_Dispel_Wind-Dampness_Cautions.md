# **Dú Huó (獨活)** · *Angelicae Pubescentis Radix* · Pubescent Angelica Root
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
This substance is drying and readily injures the yin. It should be used with caution in those with yin or blood deficiency, and should not be used in patients with internal wind. See TOXICITY below.

In *Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica*, Zhang Shan-Lei emphasizes that Angelicae Pubescentis Radix (du huo), and for that matter Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qiang huo), are best suited to very cold climates like that of northern China. In warmer climates, extremely cold and damp winds are less likely to be the sole cause of headache and other pains:

Acrid and warm [qualities] are not suited to the southeast [of China], and this applies to more than seasonal disorders. Even though Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qiang huo) and Angelicae Pubescentis Radix (du huo) are excellent medicinals for wind-cold-damp pathogens, painful obstruction, and atrophy disorders, in these provinces the yin and blood are constitutionally frail, and even if people do suffer from any of these disorders, half of the cause is blood deficiency. There might be wind-cold, but it is blood deficiency that generates the wind, and qi deficiency that generates the cold. This is vastly different from the wind painful obstruction of northwest [of China], all of which is due to bandit wind and extreme cold; the nature of the disorder is simply not the same. Thus, [in more clement climates] the use of even one acrid-warm and rigorously drying herb must be attended with caution at all times.

# **Mù Guā (木瓜)** · *Chaenomelis Fructus* · Chinese Quince
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
- Contraindicated in those with internal constrained heat and scanty dark urine. Also contraindicated in those with hyperchlorhydria. See TOXICITY below.
- *Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica* cautions that Chaenomelis Fructus (*mu gua*) should not be used if weakness of the lower back and knees is due to insufficiency of essence, blood, or true yin.
- Its flavor is sour and astringent, and thus if the Spleen and Stomach are not deficient when food stagnates, and the accumulated blockage is excessive, then it should not be used.
- In my humble opinion, a warm nature must be drying, and because the Kidneys are averse to dryness, long-term consumption [of this herb] will injure the teeth and bones.
- This passage goes on to say that because of its propensity to obstruct the flow of urine, this herb should be combined with Plantaginis Semen (*che qian zi*).

Contraindications: Because this herb is very piercing and mobilizing, excessive use will readily injure the normal qi. It should be used with caution in those with qi and/or blood deficiency or in the debilitated. See TOXICITY below.

Traditional Contraindications:
"Its nature is rapid: excessive consumption dredges the true qi of the five organs." (*Extension of the Materia Medica*)
