# **Jie Geng (桔梗)** · *Platycodi Radix* · Platycodon root, balloon flower root
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Because of this herb's acrid, dispersing, and draining qualities, it is contraindicated for chronic cough from yin deficiency or in patients with a tendency to cough up blood.

"Should not be taken if abscess or deep sores have already perforated; it is also forbidden for pregnant women." (Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica)

It is, after all, an herb that raises, and should not be used whenever pathogenic qi rushes rebelliously upward, unable to descend, or if lower burner yin is deficient and floating, or if there is a pathogen in the lower burner. It should also not be used with herbs intended to purge or to tonify the lower burner. If used incorrectly, it will certainly cause wheezing, rebellious qi, and other changes. When there is an excess disorder in the upper burner, with no disorder in the lower burner, it should then be accompanied by *Glycyrrhizae Radix* (gan cao). (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)

# **Xuan Fu Hua (旋复花)** · *Inulae Flos* · Inula flower
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Inappropriate for dry cough due to yin deficiency or for debilitated patients with loose stools.

A mobilizing, dispersing herb. If a patient tends to be deficient, they should not take it excessively. It is forbidden in those with cold affecting the Large Intestine or patients with cold from deficiency—it has thin filaments which may irritate the Lungs and cause coughing, so a cloth [bag] must be used to enclose it properly before decocting. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)

Do not improperly use it for any yin deficient cough, or cough due to consumption, as it will certainly worsen the cough in these cases. (Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica)

**Drug Interactions:**
-

**Pregnancy/Lactation:**
