# **Ge Gen (葛根)** · *Puerariae Radix* · Kudzu Root
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
If a pathogen has not yet entered the yang brightness stage, this [herb] can lead the pathogen inside- it [therefore] cannot be used. Only if the pathogen is in the greater yang stage and there are already a few symptoms of the yang brightness stage, then the important thing is to defend the yang brightness. Puerariae Radix (ge gen) must be used to cut off the pathogen's route of attack. (Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica)

Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica repeats this warning, and then elaborates:

Also, if rashes and sores have already expressed red spots, Puerariae Radix (ge gen) should not be used for fear that the exterior will be further weakened and the lesions will worsen. People with exhaustion, or excess in the upper body and deficiency in the lower, should not take it, and it should not be taken in the summer, even if there are Spleen and Stomach disorders; this is especially true for those already sweating excessively. When it is used, it should be in small doses to avoid injuring the Stomach qi from its excessive raising and dispersing.

Puerariae Radix (ge gen) is a wind herb, all of which are drying. When Divine Husbandman's Classic says that it 'generates fluids and stops thirst'; this is a misprint for 'raises fluids.' It is not that Puerariae Radix (ge gen) itself can alleviate thirst; it all depends on its raising the Stomach qi up into the Lungs so that fluids can be generated. So if the thirst does not result from the inability of clear yang to ascend, but rather from fire drying and exhausting the fluids, then mistakenly consuming this wind herb will find the wind fanning the flames and boiling away the source qi.

# **Shēng Má (升麻)** · *Cimicifugae Rhizoma* · cimicifuga, bugbane rhizome, black cohosh rhizome
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Because this herb has an ascending, floating nature, it should not be used whenever there is floating yang with yin deficiency, wheezing and fullness in the chest with a sense of qi rebelling upward, or for measles after the rash has been expressed.

*Essentials of the Materia Medica* warns: "If the lower origin is deficient and this is used to lift, and then the lower origin becomes more deficient, one should be cautious." In other words, one must ensure that herbs that tonify the primal qi are included to prevent this from occurring.

Most materia medica texts warn that this herb is not suitable for yin deficiency with fire, but *Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica* elaborates on other concerns:

It is forbidden in those with yin-deficiency fire disturbance, cough with profuse phlegm, rebellious qi with vomiting and nausea, palpitations, and severe palpitations and withdrawal-mania. Those with spitting-up of blood or nosebleed who take it by mistake will find the blood following the qi upward, such that the blood flows ceaselessly like a spring.
