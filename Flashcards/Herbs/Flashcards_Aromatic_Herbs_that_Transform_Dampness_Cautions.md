# **Sha Ren (砂仁)** · *Amomi Fructus* · Amomum fruit, grains-of-paradise fruit
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Do not use in cases of heat from yin deficiency. See Toxicity below.

Acrid, rapidly mobilizing, and drying by nature; it should not be used in those with blood deficiency or blazing fire. If overly consumed by pregnant women, it exhausts the qi, necessarily leading to difficult labor. Care should be taken to clearly differentiate [symptoms resembling its indications, but actually inappropriate, such as] abdominal pain due to fire, diarrhea due to hot summerheat, vaginal discharge due to damp-heat, cough and rebellious qi due to gushing fire compelling the Lungs, rather than cough due to obstruction of cold qi. Mistaken application is harmful (Harm and Benefit rather than beneficial: be careful in Materia Medica).
