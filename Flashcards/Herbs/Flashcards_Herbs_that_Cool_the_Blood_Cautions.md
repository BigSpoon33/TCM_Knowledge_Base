**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Inappropriate for those with cold in the blood, or in women who are either pregnant or have excessive menstrual bleeding when this is not due to blood heat combined with blood stasis. See Toxicity below.

With its turbid aroma, it very easily brings on nausea; those with weak stomachs will vomit as soon as they take it. It also invigorates the blood and unblocks stagnation. Thus, it is contraindicated for those with cold from deficiency of the Stomach, women with heavy bleeding or extended menses, and those who are pregnant. It cannot be used for hemorrhages due to blood heat if there is no concurrent blood stagnation. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)

# **Sheng Di Huang (生地黄)** · *Rehmanniae Radix* · Rehmannia root, Chinese foxglove root
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated where there is significant dampness from Spleen deficiency, or in those with loose stools and abdominal fullness. See Toxicity below.

- Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) cools the blood, but if the patient has weak Stomach qi it may impede digestion.
- Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di huang) tonifies the blood, but for those with excessive phlegm and thin mucus it may bind up the diaphragm.
Traditional Contraindications
Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) cools the blood, but if the patient has weak Stomach qi it may impede digestion; Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di huang) tonifies the blood, but for those with excessive phlegm and thin mucus it may bind up the diaphragm. It is said that after frying Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) with wine, it will not
impede the Stomach, and that after preparing Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di huang) with ginger, it will not bind the diaphragm. In such cases, it is necessary to analyze, in the patient, the degree of both the primal qi and the pathogenic qi before using either [herb]. Their use should be avoided in postpartum patients with poor appetite, diarrhea, or abdominal pain or clumping; deficiency consumption patients with weak Spleen and Stomach leading to unformed stools, and excessive phlegm in the chest and abdomen; and in those where there is a lack of free-flowing qi and obstruction of its ascent and descent. (Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica)

This book also cautions against allowing Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) to come into contact with iron during its preparation or decoction.
