# **Hú Jiāo (胡椒)** · *Piperis Fructus* · Pepper
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated during pregnancy.
- "Acrid, warm, and depleting through dispersal, it can disturb fire in the Spleen and Lungs; excessive use makes people's eyes blurry: it should particularly not be used in food." (Grand Materia Medica)
- "Excessive consumption overly mobilizes and thus drains the true qi, causing Intestinal deficiency and tenesmus." (Extension of the Materia Medica)
Excessive consumption disturbs the fire, dries the yin fluids, depletes the qi, and injures the yin. It breaks up blood and aborts fetuses during pregnancy, brings out sores, and injures the eyes. Thus, pregnant women and those suffering from yin deficiency with internal heat, bleeding disorders, or hemorrhoid sufferers, and anyone who happens to have throat, mouth, teeth, or eye problems [at the time it might be consumed]-for all of these it is contraindicated. (Food and Drink Recipes from the Lay Buddhist Sui-Xi)

# **Wu Zhu Yu (吳茱萸)** · *Evodiae Fructus* · Evodia fruit
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Because this is extremely drying and can consume the qi and perturb fire, it should not be consumed long term. Contraindicated when yin deficiency leads to heat signs.
Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing Shu (神農本草經疏 shen nong ben cao jing shu) gives careful directions regarding the contraindications of this herb, laid out by symptom:

For vomiting or acid regurgitation, it must be due to externally-contracted pathogenic wind-cold, or to dormant cold phlegm or harbored pathogenic water. [It] must not be used for vomiting or acid regurgitation due to Stomach fire.

For abdominal pain, it cannot be due to blood deficiency with fire.

For bulging disorders, it must be due to pathogenic cold, and furthermore should be the first or second time the bulging has occurred, when deficiency has not yet become a factor.

Its standard proscriptions include all yin deficiency patterns, and those with heat rather than cold in the organs.
