## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Because of its strong bitter, cold, and drying properties, it should be used with caution in those with patterns of cold, yang deficiency, or yin deficiency, especially those with cold from deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach. See Toxicity below.

Traditional Contraindications

Strictly forbidden for illness due to cold from deficiency. As a rule, [this herb] is contraindicated for all of the following conditions: patients with blood and qi deficiency; Spleen and Stomach weakness; insomnia and fright due to blood deficiency, yet appearing with restless heat and thirst; post-partum insomnia, fever due to blood deficiency, and diarrhea with abdominal pain; pox and sores in children who have diarrhea due to yang deficiency... and insufficiency of true yin leading to internal heat and restless irritability. (*Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica*)

*Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica*, however, emphasizes its marked drying property, concluding that "Whenever the tongue coating is not thick, yellow, greasy, turbid, and fully covering the tongue, then this greatly cold and very bitter herb should not be wantonly used."

# **Huáng Qín (黄芩)** · *Scutellariae Radix* · Scutellaria, baical skullcap root, scute
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in cases of cold from deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach.
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica explains that, despite all the virtues of Scutellariae Radix (Huang Qin), "still its bitterness can harm the Stomach because of its downward-directing [action], and thus it necessarily depletes generative qi." It goes on to comment on the general use of this herb in pregnancy, made popular by Zhu Dan-Xi:

Dan-Xi established Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (Bai Zhu) and Scutellariae Radix (Huang Qin) as sage-like herbs for quieting the fetus. He said that during pregnancy, the heat should be cleared and the blood should be cooled, so that the blood did not move chaotically, as only then could it nourish the fetus. His theory is not incorrect, but later physicians came to regard Scutellariae Radix (Huang Qin) as an essential herb for the pregnant mother, and it even became a common folk remedy that was invariably used in pregnancy. Yet constitutions are not inevitably hot- what is the reason for its general use? Zhang Lu [in Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica] stated that Scutellariae Radix (Huang Qin) is appropriate for fetal heat leading to restless raising movement, but for fetal cold leading to descent, or for poor appetite and diarrhea, it should not be rashly employed-this is accurate.

# **Kǔ Shēn (苦参)** · *Sophorae Flavescentis Radix* · Sophora Root
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in cases of cold from deficiency of the Spleen or Stomach. It should not be combined with Veratri nigri Radix et Rhizoma (li lu). See Toxicity below.

cautions: Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica

"All herbs which are very bitter and very cold are inevitably very drying in nature, and excessive use cannot but injure the Spleen or deplete the Kidneys." It notes that Shen Cun-Zhong recorded that he had used Sophorae Flavescentis Radix for many years as a toothpaste (ku shen) for his dental problems, but soon suffered from disabling lower backache. His friend also used Sophorae Flavescentis Radix (ku shen) in the same way, and likewise suffered from backache. Both gave up this practice, and their backaches thereupon ceased. "This, then, is a clear sign that Sophorae Flavescentis Radix (ku shen) damages the Kidneys!" Zhu Dan-Xi, however, rejected this conclusion: "If the lower back feels heavy when using Sophorae Flavescentis Radix (ku shen), this is because its qi directs downward and does not raise, not because it injures the Kidneys!"

# **Long Dan Cao (龙胆草)** · *Gentianae Radix* · Gentian Root, Chinese Gentian Root
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in cases of cold from deficiency of the Spleen or Stomach.
- See Toxicity below.

*Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica* cautions:

"Bitter and cold, it greatly damages the Stomach qi - it is forbidden in those without fire from excess. Even though it can eliminate heat from excess and drain the Liver and Gallbladder, still, if the Stomach is deficient or there is a lack of blood, it cannot be tried lightly. Whenever an illness involves deficiency of both the Spleen and Stomach, and the deficiency involves heat, it is forbidden to take Gentianae Radix (龙胆草, long dan cao). It should also not be taken on an empty stomach, otherwise it will cause incontinence of urine as its draining is too extreme."
