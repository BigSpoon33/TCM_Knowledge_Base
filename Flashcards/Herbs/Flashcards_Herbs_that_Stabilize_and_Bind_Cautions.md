# **Chi Shi Zhi (赤石脂)** · *Halloysitum Rubrum* · Halloysite, Kaolin
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
According to some traditional sources, this herb antagonizes Cinnamomi Cortex (Rou Gui).

Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica warns that before using astringent substances, most of the pathogenic influences that are causing the problem should be eliminated. For example, "if a vaginal discharge is completely damp-heat, it should not be used"; and "the method for incessant uterine bleeding should be to tonify the yin and clear heat; one cannot totally depend upon binding and restraint." This book goes on to warn that, in cases where the pathogenic influence has not been removed, "herbs to arrest and bind are certainly inappropriate: take care, take care!"

# **He Zi (诃子)** · *Chebulae Fructus* · Chebulae Fruit
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in exterior patterns or in those with internal accumulation and stagnation of damp-heat.

Traditional Contraindications:
>"It cannot be casually used for qi deficiency and sudden cough, or in the early stages of diarrhea." (Introduction to Medicine)
"Deficient people should not use it by itself." (Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica)
"Its bitter, downward-directing nature should be avoided if the upper burner primal qi is deficient and sinking." (Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica)

Very few realize that although 'astringency secures abandonment', a downward-directing, inhibiting nature is not as good as the Spleen-augmenting power of sweetness and warmth [for treating deficiency]. For this reason [this herb] can only be used in those cases of long-term cough and wheezing in which the true qi has not yet been weakened, as [the herb] has a quite compelling ability to check [and restrain]. Furthermore [in such cases as]long-term cough due to fire from yin deficiency blazing upward [or]long term dysenteric disorders with a fire from deficiency that is forcing downward, the more one compels and checks, the more obstruction results. (Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica)

>In cases such as these, one must first eliminate the fire from deficiency by tonifying the yin, rather than attempting astringent restraint.
