# **Bái Jiàng Cǎo (白 Jiang 草)** · *Patriniae Herba* · Patrinia
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica observes that this herb "cannot be used if pus has formed and the heat toxin is forcing its way outward" because its bitter, descending nature opposes the natural outward moving tendency of the sore itself. This viewpoint is characteristic of one of the main schools of external medicine, which holds that the excessive use of bitter, cold medicines can trap the toxins internally.

# **Jin Yin Hua (金银花)** · *Lonicerae Flos* · Honeysuckle Flower
## What are the Cautions & Contraindications for this herb?
?
**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
- Contraindicated in those with deficiency cold of the Spleen and Stomach and particularly for qi deficient sores with clear pus.
- Detailed Materia Medica cautions that it "should be used sparingly for patients with cold from deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach."
- Because it is cold, whenever there is cold from deficiency and weakness of the Spleen and Stomach it should not be used, lest one suffer cold in the middle leading to abdominal pain, loose stools, and diarrhea. Once the pus has been brought to a head, it should only be used in small doses. [The reason for this is that] the classics say that cold causes blood to congeal, and the sore will not easily heal.

When using this herb to treat wind-fire or damp-heat, it can be used as the chief constituent, but only for a short time; it cannot be used for any extended period of time.
It enters the Lungs and disperses clumping at the qi level, thus dispersing wind-phlegm. However, if clumping is present, it will disperse the clumps, but if there is no actual clumping, it will disperse the qi. This will inevitably lead to wheezing from deficiency.
