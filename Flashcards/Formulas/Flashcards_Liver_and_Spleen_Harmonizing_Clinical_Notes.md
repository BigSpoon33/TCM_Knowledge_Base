### Traditional Understanding
"Si Ni" means "four reversals" referring to cold extremities, but this is different from Si Ni Tang. Here the cold is due to yang qi constraint from liver qi stagnation, not true yang deficiency. Classic formula for "yang qi constraint" where emotional stress blocks normal qi circulation. The four-herb combination perfectly addresses liver qi stagnation.
