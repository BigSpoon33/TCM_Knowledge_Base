# **Chai Xian Tang** (Bupleurum and Pueraria Decoction, Chai Hu Ge Gen Tang, Exterior-Releasing Combination)
## What are the details for **Clinical Notes & Commentary**?
?
### Traditional Understanding
Combines the shaoyang-harmonizing action of Chai Hu with the muscle-relaxing and exterior-releasing properties of Ge Gen. Particularly effective for conditions where external pathogen invasion combines with muscle tension and stiffness. The formula addresses both the pathogen and the constitutional tension pattern.

# **Xiao Chai Hu Tang** (Minor Bupleurum Decoction, Small Chai Hu Decoction, Xiao Chaihu Tang)
## What are the details for **Clinical Notes & Commentary**?
?
### Traditional Understanding
"Xiao Chai Hu Tang" is the master formula for shaoyang stage patterns - the half-exterior, half-interior stage where pathogens are stuck between the exterior and interior. Chai Hu releases the pathogen outward while Huang Qin clears internal heat. The combination creates a "pivot" that allows stuck pathogens to resolve. Essential for chronic conditions with alternating symptoms.
