### Traditional Understanding
"Tian Ma Gou Teng" represents the classic combination for liver yang rising transforming into internal wind. Tian Ma extinguishes wind while Gou Teng pacifies liver yang. The formula addresses both the root (liver-kidney yin deficiency) and the manifestation (yang rising and wind stirring). Essential for neurological symptoms from liver imbalance.
