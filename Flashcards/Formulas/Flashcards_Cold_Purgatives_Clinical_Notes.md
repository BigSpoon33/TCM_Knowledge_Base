# **Xiao Cheng Qi Tang** (Minor Order the Qi Decoction, Small Coordinate Qi Decoction, Xiaochengqi Tang)
## What are the details for **Clinical Notes & Commentary**?
?
### Traditional Understanding
"Xiao Cheng Qi" means "minor coordination of qi" - a gentler version of Da Cheng Qi Tang that focuses on moving qi and relieving mild to moderate constipation. Without Mang Xiao, it's less drastically purging but still effective for yangming bowel patterns. Perfect balance for constipation with qi stagnation but without severe heat accumulation.
