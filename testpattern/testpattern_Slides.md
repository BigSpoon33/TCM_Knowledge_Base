title: Test Patterns
subtitle: A TCM Perspective (Example)

---

---
## Overview

*   **Category:** Diagnostic tool
*   **Key Characteristics:**  Objective measure of system function; pattern of disharmony manifests as identifiable distortion in the expected pattern.
    *   Allows for comparative analysis over time 📈 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Quantifiable assessment of the impact of treatment 📉 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: [This is a metaphorical use of "test pattern" - adapting the concept for TCM diagnosis. The "pattern" is the patient's overall condition.]

---
## Etiology & Pathology

*   **Etiology:**  Any imbalance or deficiency
    *   External Pathogenic Factors (Wind, Cold, Heat, Damp) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Internal Emotional Factors (Anger, Joy, Worry, Grief, Fear, Shock) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Dietary Irregularities <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Lifestyle factors (Overwork, Lack of Exercise) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
*   **Pathology:** Each factor disrupts the proper flow of Qi and Blood, creating patterns of disharmony. These are analogous to distortions in a standard test pattern.

Note: [The etiology and pathology create the specific distortions or "noise" in the body's energetic system.]

---
## Clinical Manifestations

*   Each pattern will result in specific symptoms.
    *   Example: Liver Qi Stagnation
        *   Hypochondriac Distention  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
        *   Irritability <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
        *   Sighing <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
        *   PMS in women <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: [Symptoms are the "distortions" that help to identify the underlying "test pattern" deficiency.]

---
## Tongue & Pulse

*   **Tongue:** Provides visual information about the state of Zang-Fu organs.
    *   Color: Red, Pale, Purple <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Coating: Thick, Thin, Yellow, White <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Shape: Swollen, Cracked, Deviated <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Example: Red tongue with thin yellow coating suggests Heat 🥵 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

*   **Pulse:** Reflects the state of Qi and Blood.
    *   Depth: Superficial, Deep <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Speed: Rapid, Slow <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Strength: Forceful, Weak <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Shape: Wiry, Slippery, Choppy <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    *   Example: Wiry pulse suggests Liver Qi Stagnation 💪 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Note: [Tongue and pulse are essential for differential diagnosis.]

---
## Differential Diagnosis

Similar patterns may share symptoms.
*  Example: Liver Qi Stagnation vs. Liver Blood Deficiency
    * Liver Qi Stagnation: more characterized by distention and irritability
    * Liver Blood Deficiency: more characterized by dizziness and blurred vision.

Note: [Careful analysis of ALL signs and symptoms is critical.]

---
## Treatment Principles

*   **Primary:** Address the root cause of the disharmony.
*   **Secondary:** Alleviate the branch symptoms.
    *   Example: Liver Qi Stagnation
        *   Primary: Soothe the Liver, Regulate Qi 🌿 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
        *   Secondary: Alleviate pain 📍 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: [Consider the severity of the disharmony when formulating a treatment plan.]
