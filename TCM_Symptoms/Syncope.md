# Syncope (Fainting / Loss of Consciousness)

## Overview
Syncope (厥证 Jue Zheng) refers to sudden loss of consciousness with collapse. In TCM, it represents a severe disruption of Qi and Blood circulation to the head and Heart, or disturbance of the Shen (Spirit).

## TCM Perspective

### Pattern Differentiation

- **Qi Deficiency (Qi Jue)**
  - Gradual onset with warning (dizziness, blurred vision)
  - Pale face, cold limbs, sweating
  - Weak breathing, fatigue before episode
  - Tongue: pale
  - Pulse: weak, thready

- **Blood Deficiency**
  - Gradual onset after standing, exertion, or blood loss
  - Pale/sallow face, dizziness, palpitations
  - Often in women with heavy menses
  - Tongue: pale, thin
  - Pulse: thready, weak

- **Yang Deficiency (Cold Limb Reversal)**
  - Cold limbs, pale face, aversion to cold
  - Weak constitution, chronic illness
  - Shallow breathing, low voice
  - Tongue: pale, wet
  - Pulse: deep, weak, slow

- **Phlegm Turbidity Obstructing**
  - Sudden onset, may have warning signs
  - Nausea, chest oppression before episode
  - Obesity, heavy sensation
  - Tongue: swollen, thick greasy coating
  - Pulse: slippery

- **Liver Wind / Liver Yang Rising**
  - Sudden onset, often with headache/dizziness
  - Irritability, flushed face, tinnitus
  - May have tremors or spasms
  - Tongue: red, yellow coating
  - Pulse: wiry, rapid

- **Heart Fire Harassing Pericardium**
  - Sudden collapse with high fever or emotional shock
  - Delirium, incoherent speech
  - Restlessness before collapse
  - Tongue: deep red, yellow coating
  - Pulse: rapid, overflowing or hidden

### Organs Involved

- **Heart**: Houses Shen; Heart Qi collapse causes loss of consciousness
- **Spleen**: Source of Qi/Blood; deficiency fails to nourish Heart/Brain
- **Liver**: Stores Blood; controls smooth Qi flow; Wind/Yang can rise and disturb Shen
- **Kidney**: Root of Qi; Yang deficiency fails to support consciousness

### Pathomechanisms

**Deficiency patterns:**
- Qi/Blood/Yang deficiency → fails to nourish Heart and Brain → collapse

**Excess patterns:**
- Phlegm, Wind, Fire rising → obstructs clear Yang from reaching head → collapse
- Emotional shock → disrupts Heart Shen → sudden collapse

## Western Medical Context

Correlates with vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, hypoglycemia, etc. TCM pattern differentiation helps identify underlying constitution and triggers.

**Requires immediate Western evaluation if:**
- First episode
- During exertion (cardiac concern)
- With chest pain or palpitations
- Prolonged unconsciousness
- Seizure activity

## Diagnostic Significance

**Key differentiating factors:**
- **Speed of onset**: Gradual (deficiency) vs sudden (excess/Wind)
- **Trigger**: Standing (Blood def), emotion (Liver), heat (Heart Fire)
- **Recovery**: Quick (Qi def) vs slow (severe Yang def, Wind)
- **Limb temperature**: Cold (Yang def) vs warm (excess patterns)

## Treatment Approaches

### Emergency Management (Acute Episode)

**Immediate acupuncture points:**
- [[Renzhong (DU-26)]]: Restore consciousness (strong stimulation)
- [[Baihui (DU-20)]]: Raise Yang, restore consciousness
- [[Yongquan (KI-1)]]: Ground excessive Yang, restore consciousness
- [[Neiguan (PC-6)]]: Calm Heart, open chest
- [[Hegu (LI-4)]]: Restore Yang, move Qi

**Moxibustion for cold limb reversal (Yang deficiency):**
- [[Guanyuan (RN-4)]]: Warm Yang
- [[Qihai (RN-6)]]: Tonify original Qi

### By Pattern (Preventive Treatment)

- **Qi Deficiency**: Tonify Qi → [[Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang]], [[Si Jun Zi Tang]]
- **Blood Deficiency**: Nourish Blood → [[Si Wu Tang]], [[Dang Gui Bu Xue Tang]]
- **Yang Deficiency**: Warm Yang → [[Shen Fu Tang]], [[You Gui Wan]]
- **Phlegm**: Resolve Phlegm → [[Er Chen Tang]], [[Wen Dan Tang]]
- **Liver Yang/Wind**: Subdue Liver, extinguish Wind → [[Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin]]
- **Heart Fire**: Clear Heart Fire, calm Shen → [[Huang Lian Jie Du Tang]]

### Common Points (Preventive)

- [[Zusanli (ST-36)]]: Tonify Qi/Blood, strengthen Spleen
- [[Sanyinjiao (SP-6)]]: Nourish Blood, tonify Spleen/Kidney
- [[Guanyuan (RN-4)]]: Tonify original Qi/Yang
- [[Xinshu (BL-15)]]: Nourish Heart, calm Shen
- [[Pishu (BL-17)]]: Tonify Spleen Qi
- [[Taichong (LV-3)]]: Subdue Liver Yang, extinguish Wind

### Common Herbs

- **For Qi Deficiency**: [[Ren Shen]], [[Huang Qi]], [[Dang Shen]]
- **For Blood Deficiency**: [[Dang Gui]], [[Shu Di Huang]], [[Bai Shao]]
- **For Yang Deficiency**: [[Fu Zi]], [[Rou Gui]], [[Lu Jiao Jiao]]
- **For Phlegm**: [[Ban Xia]], [[Chen Pi]], [[Fu Ling]]
- **For Liver Wind**: [[Tian Ma]], [[Gou Teng]], [[Shi Jue Ming]]
- **Resuscitation**: [[Su He Xiang]], [[Shi Chang Pu]] (aromatic, open orifices)

### Common Formulas

- [[Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang]]: Qi deficiency fainting from standing/exertion
- [[Dang Gui Bu Xue Tang]]: Blood deficiency syncope
- [[Tian Ma Gou Teng Yin]]: Liver Yang/Wind syncope with hypertension
- [[Su He Xiang Wan]]: Emergency resuscitation (aromatic)
- [[An Gong Niu Huang Wan]]: Heat/phlegm obscuring orifices (emergency)

## Differential Diagnosis

**TCM vs Western:**
- **Vasovagal syncope**: Often Qi/Blood deficiency in TCM
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Blood/Yang deficiency
- **Cardiac syncope**: Heart Qi/Yang deficiency or Heart Blood stasis
- **Seizure**: Often Liver Wind, Phlegm-Fire
- **Hypoglycemia**: Spleen Qi deficiency, Blood deficiency

**Within TCM:**
- **Cold limbs + pale**: Yang deficiency
- **Cold limbs + flushed face before**: Liver Yang reversal
- **Warm throughout + sudden**: Phlegm, Fire, emotional shock

## Notes

**Emergency protocols:**
- Always ensure airway, breathing, circulation (ABC)
- DU-26 and DU-20 are emergency revival points
- Yang deficiency collapse benefits from immediate moxibustion
- Repeated episodes require Western workup (cardiac, neurological)

**Clinical pearls:**
- Young women fainting = often Blood deficiency (menses, diet)
- Elderly fainting = often Yang deficiency or Phlegm
- Emotional trigger = Liver Qi stagnation → sudden reversal
- Hot weather fainting = Qi/Yang collapse from Heat damaging Qi

**Prevention:**
- Address underlying deficiency/excess pattern
- Avoid triggers (heat, standing, fasting for deficiency types)
- Build constitutional strength with herbs/acupuncture
