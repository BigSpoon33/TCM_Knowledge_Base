## 1. Executive Summary

This retrospective for Epic 5, "Validation Engine," was a critical course-correction for the project. While all stories were marked 'done', the team discovered that the core validation logic was incomplete, making the engine a "skeleton" and not a functional dependency. The session successfully identified this critical risk, established a plan to complete the work, and created a strategy to audit past epics for similar issues.

## 2. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Critical Finding:** Epic 5 is not functionally complete. The AI Senior Developer review for story `5-1` had marked it as `BLOCKED` due to unimplemented core logic (`validate_data_types`, `validate_frontmatter_schema`) and insufficient testing.
*   **Systemic Risk:** The process of marking stories "done" was flawed, as it didn't properly account for the outcome of the final review. This has raised concerns that similar "skeletons" may exist in Epics 0-4.
*   **Process Value:** This session highlighted the absolute necessity of the retrospective ceremony. Without it, the team would have started Epic 6 on a faulty foundation, leading to significant rework and delays.

## 3. Action Plan & Commitments

### Immediate Priority: Complete Epic 5

*   **Action:** Halt all work on Epic 6.
*   **Action:** Create and execute a new set of technical stories to fully implement and test the Validation Engine.
*   **Owner:** Development Team (Charlie, Dana)
*   **Briefing Document:** `docs/sprint-artifacts/epic-5-completion-stories-briefing.md`

### Strategic Priority: Audit Past Work

*   **Action:** Schedule and conduct a "Historical Pattern Review and Completeness Audit" for Epics 0-4.
*   **Owner:** BMad to initiate, Bob to facilitate.
*   **Briefing Document:** `docs/sprint-artifacts/historical-review-briefing.md`

## 4. Final Readiness Assessment

*   **Epic 5 Status:** **INCOMPLETE**. Requires further development and testing.
*   **Epic 6 Readiness:** **BLOCKED**. Cannot proceed until Epic 5 is truly complete.

## 5. Next Steps

1.  Conclude this retrospective session.
2.  In a new session, initiate the Epic 5 completion work by pointing the agent to the briefing document.
3.  Once Epic 5 is verified as complete, initiate the Historical Review in a separate session using its briefing document.
