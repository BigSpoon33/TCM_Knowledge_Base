## 📊 Epic Summary

**Epic 12** delivered a comprehensive visual and interactive upgrade to the dashboard system, implementing a modular CSS framework, interactive filtering, and polished templates.

- **Status:** Completed (Fast-tracked)
- **Stories Delivered:** 8/8 (Estimated based on deliverables)
- **Key Achievement:** Delivered a professional-grade, theme-aware dashboard system with interactive filtering.
- **Velocity:** Completed in a single "fast run" session.

**Deliverables Verified:**
1. **Modular CSS Framework:** `capsule/templates/css/` with core, components, layouts, and themes.
2. **Interactive Templates:** `master-dashboard.md.j2` and `capsule-dashboard.md.j2` updated with `meta-bind` integration.
3. **Theme Support:** `neon`, `academic`, and `minimal` themes implemented.
4. **Documentation:** `CSS_THEMING_GUIDE.md` created.

## 🏆 What Went Well

- **Modular CSS Architecture:** The decision to split CSS into `base`, `components`, `layouts`, and `themes` ensures maintainability and extensibility.
- **Meta-Bind Integration:** The interactive filtering on the Master Dashboard transforms it from a static page to a dynamic application.
- **Theme-Aware Design:** Using CSS variables and `ocds-theme-*` classes allows for seamless theme switching without breaking layouts.
- **Scoped Styling:** The use of `cssclass: ocds-dashboard` prevents style leakage into the rest of the user's vault.
- **Rapid Execution:** The team moved from research to full implementation incredibly fast, delivering a polished product without bureaucratic overhead.

## 🐢 Challenges & Deviations

- **Documentation Gap:** The "fast run" meant story files and sprint status tracking were bypassed. We had to reconstruct the epic's history from code artifacts.
- **Testing Visibility:** Because of the speed, formal testing records (especially for mobile responsiveness) are missing, though the code suggests responsive design was implemented.
- **Deployment Verification:** We need to confirm that the new CSS files are correctly copied during `capsule generate`, as this is a new artifact type.

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **CSS Modules > Snippets:** Moving away from monolithic snippets to a modular file structure was the right call for a system this complex.
2. **Interactivity is Key:** Adding `meta-bind` buttons and inputs significantly elevates the user experience, making the dashboard feel "alive."
3. **Stealth Epics Happen:** Sometimes momentum takes over and we build faster than we track. Retrospectives become even more important in these cases to capture what happened.
