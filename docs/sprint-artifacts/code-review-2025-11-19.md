# Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** BMad
**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Outcome:** Blocked

## Summary

The review for story `5-6-validation-report-generation` is **blocked**. The story file and its corresponding context file are missing from the repository, and the implementation is incomplete. The sprint status has been updated to reflect this.

## Key Findings

- **[HIGH] Missing Story File:** The story file `5-6-validation-report-generation.md` and its context file are missing from the repository. This prevents a proper review of the acceptance criteria and tasks.
- **[HIGH] Incomplete Implementation:** The `capsule/utils/validation.py` file contains only stub code and does not include any logic for generating a validation report.
- **[MEDIUM] Inaccurate Sprint Status:** The story was marked as "review" in `sprint-status.yaml`, but the implementation is not complete.

## Action Items

- [ ] **[High]** Create the story file `5-6-validation-report-generation.md` with the correct acceptance criteria and tasks.
- [ ] **[High]** Implement the validation report generation logic in `capsule/utils/validation.py`.
- [ ] **[Medium]** Update the sprint status to "in-progress" until the implementation is complete.
