# Story Quality Validation Report

Story: 11-6-advanced-filtering-heading-extraction - advanced-filtering-heading-extraction
Outcome: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 0, Minor: 2)

## Critical Issues (Blockers)

None.

## Major Issues (Should Fix)

None.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

1.  **Missing 'File List' in Dev Agent Record**: The `Dev Agent Record` section is missing the `File List` subsection. The list of new files is present in the `Learnings from Previous Story` section, but for consistency, it should be in its own subsection.
2.  **Missing Change Log**: The story file does not contain a `Change Log` section to track changes to the story over time.

## Successes

-   **Excellent Continuity:** The story does a great job of capturing the learnings and context from the previous story.
-   **Thorough Source Coverage:** All relevant source documents are cited, and the story correctly identifies which documents were not found.
-   **Perfect AC and Task Mapping:** The acceptance criteria are directly from the tech spec, and the tasks are well-mapped to the ACs.
-   **High-Quality Dev Notes:** The dev notes provide specific, actionable guidance with clear citations.
-   **Solid Structure:** The story is well-structured and follows the required format.
