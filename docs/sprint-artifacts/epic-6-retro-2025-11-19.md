## 1. Executive Summary

This retrospective for Epic 6, "Capsule Packaging," revealed a critical process failure that was a repeat of the issues discovered in the Epic 5 retrospective. The team identified a pattern of "phantom completion," where stories were marked as 'done' but were functionally incomplete or untested. This session was a turning point, resulting in a decision to halt new feature development and execute a "quality and stability sprint" to address the technical debt from both Epic 5 and Epic 6.

## 2. Key Discoveries & Insights

*   **Critical Finding:** The team is not learning from its mistakes. The same process failures that led to the incompletion of Epic 5 were repeated in Epic 6.
*   **Systemic Risk:** The definition of 'done' is not clear or consistently enforced, leading to a significant amount of technical debt and instability in the foundation of the project.
*   **Process Value:** This retrospective was essential for identifying the recurring process failure and creating a concrete plan to address it. It prevented the team from building on an unstable foundation.
