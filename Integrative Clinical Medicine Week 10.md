# Stroke
[Merck Manual Stroke](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/neurologic-disorders/stroke/overview-of-stroke?query=stroke)

## Ischemic
80% typically resulting from thrombosis or embolism

## Hemorrhagic
20% resulting from vascular rupture

## Etiology & Pathology
### Overwork, emotional stress and excessive sexual activity
Lead to deficiency of Kidney-yin
Deficiency of Kidney-yin often leads to deficiency of Liver-yin and the rising of Liver-yang. Liver-yang, especially in the elderly, often gives rise to Liver-wind. Liver-wind causes apoplexy, coma, mental cloudiness and paralysis, and the tongue is moving, deviated or stiff.

### Irregular diet and physical overwork
Eating irregularly or eating excessive amounts of fats, diary foods,  
greasy, fried foods, and sugar weakens the Spleen and leads to  
Phlegm, which predisposes to obesity. Eventually, phlegm often  
combines with Fire to form Phlegm-fire. Phlegm causes  
numbness in the limbs, mental cloudiness, slurred speech or  
aphasia, and a swollen tongue with a sticky coating.

### Excessive Sexual Activity and Inadequate Rest
Excessive sexual activity combined with inadequate rest  
weakens the Kidney-essence and leads to Marrow  
deficiency. Marrow fails to nourish Blood and, eventually  
this may lead to stasis of Blood. Stasis of blood causes  
stiffness and pain in the limbs and a Purple tongue.

### Physical Overwork
Such as excessive lifting or excessive exercise and sport  
activities, weakens the Spleen, the muscles and the  
channels. The pre-existing internal Wind exploits the  
deficiency of Qi and Blood in the channels to penetrate  
them. On the other hand, exposure to external Wind  
interacts with the internal Wind in the channels and this  
leads to paralysis of the limbs.

## Four Pathogenic Factors of Wind-Stroke
| Pathogenic Factor | Tongue Appearance           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Wind              | moving, deviated, quivering |
| Phlegm            | swollen, sticky coat        |
| Fire              | red body                    |
| Stasis            | reddish-purple body         |
## Differentiation
### Mild Type
the mild type
unilateral paralysis, numbness, slurred speech
no loss of consciousness
💡 We are much more likely to see a mild type attack in clinic so know this well 💡
#### Attack of the Main Channels

#### Attack of the Connecting Channels

### Severe Type
If px loses consciousness it's in the organs
Critical red flag
⚠️ **CALL 911** ⚠️

#### Tense Type
##### Hot type
##### Cold Type

#### Flaccid Type
