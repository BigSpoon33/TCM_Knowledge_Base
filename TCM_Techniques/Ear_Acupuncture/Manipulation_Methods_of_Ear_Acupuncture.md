# 🩺 Manipulation Methods of Ear Acupuncture

## 📖 Overview

The procedure involves identifying sensitive acupoints, ensuring strict aseptic conditions, precise needle insertion, appropriate retention time, and careful removal to achieve therapeutic effects.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Probing sensitive spots for point detection
- Aseptic procedure for skin preparation
- Filiform needle insertion technique
- Needle retention protocols
- Careful needle removal procedures
- Embedding needles for longer retention
- Needling with electrical stimulation

## 💉 Treatment Protocols

## 📊 Prognosis

Patients who experience sensations of pain, heat, distension, soreness, or heaviness during needle insertion generally achieve satisfactory therapeutic results.

---

## 🛡️ Prevention & Prophylaxis

Routine asepsis of auricular points with 75% alcohol or 20% iodine should be performed. After needle removal, the puncture hole should be pressed with a dry cotton ball to avoid bleeding and immediately swabbed with iodine to prevent infection.

---

## ⚠️ Clinical Remarks

Filiform needling remains the most widely used method. Needles are typically retained for 25 to 30 minutes, but for severe pain or chronic seizures, retention may be longer or needle embedding applied. If acupuncture sensation (deqi) does not appear, the direction of needling should be adjusted to elicit it.
