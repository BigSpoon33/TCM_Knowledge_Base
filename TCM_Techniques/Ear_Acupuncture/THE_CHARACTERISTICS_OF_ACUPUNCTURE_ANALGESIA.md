## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Acupuncture analgesia does not produce any side-effects or accidents associated with drug anesthesia.
2. It avoids common post-operative complications such as respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal dysfunction, abdominal distension, and retention of urine.

### Pathological Mechanism
Acupuncture functions to regulate the physiological condition of the human body, allowing doctors to take immediate measures to avoid physiological disturbance caused by severe pain. This regulation helps maintain stable blood pressure, pulse, and respiration rates during operation, leading to early post-operative recovery, including appetite, ambulatory activities, and satisfactory wound healing.

## üîç Differential Diagnosis

### vs. Drug Anesthesia
Acupuncture analgesia is completely safe with no death attributed to needling, does not produce side-effects or accidents common with drug anesthesia, and avoids post-operative complications. It also allows the patient to remain mentally alert and cooperate with surgeons, which is not possible with general drug anesthesia.

## üìä Prognosis

Patients under acupuncture analgesia experience normal physiological state post-operation, characterized by early regaining of appetite, early ambulatory activities, and satisfactory healing of wounds, all conducive to a rapid recovery.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Clinical Remarks

Acupuncture analgesia is particularly suitable for aged patients with weak constitution, and those with pre-existing cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or renal conditions, or who are too sick to sustain drug anaesthesia.
