**Key Characteristics:**
- Does not require sophisticated medical equipment
- Not restrained by preferential environment
- Raises pain threshold and endurance
- Patient remains mentally alert during the surgical operation
- Mechanism involves the nervous system

### Pathological Mechanism
The mechanism of acupuncture analgesia has been preliminarily outlined, although further studies are still needed to reach a thorough explanation. Clinical practice and scientific experiments demonstrate that the nervous system is involved in pain suppression and physiological regulation, and the functional integrity of the nervous system is a prerequisite to producing needling sensation and analgesic effect.

**Affected Organs:** Nervous System (central to analgesic mechanism), Heart (e.g., in cases of associated anxiety and palpitation during surgery), Various organs subject to surgical intervention (site of application)

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Heart Qi Disturbance

**Type:** Mixed

#### Main Manifestations
- palpitation
- shortness of breath
- anxiety (especially in the preoperative period or during chest operations)

**Tongue:** Not mentioned in the text.
**Pulse:** Not mentioned in the text.

#### TCM Analysis
These symptoms, often occurring during chest operations, are caused by the disturbance of heart qi according to traditional Chinese medicine theory.

---

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Heart Qi Disturbance

**Treatment Principle:** Tranquilize the heart, sedate the mind and regulate the heart qi.

**Needle Technique:** N/A (Not Specified For This Pattern, General Manipulation Techniques Described In The Text Apply)

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Ximen (P 4)]] | tranquilize the heart, sedate the mind and regulate the heart qi |
| [[Neiguan (P 6)]] | tranquilize the heart, sedate the mind and regulate the heart qi |

#### Explanation
According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, symptoms like palpitation, shortness of breath, and anxiety, especially during chest operations, are caused by the disturbance of heart qi. Thus, Ximen (P 4) and Neiguan (P 6) are usually selected to tranquilize the heart, sedate the mind and regulate the heart qi.

## üîç Differential Diagnosis

### vs. Not applicable
This text describes a medical treatment technique (acupuncture analgesia) rather than a disease requiring differential diagnosis from other conditions.

## üìä Prognosis

Acupuncture analgesia aims to achieve successful operative results. Patients often experience an early recovery, regaining appetite and ambulatory activity soon after the operation with proper medical guidance and general nursing care.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention & Prophylaxis

Preventive measures focus on comprehensive preoperative preparations to ensure the success and safety of acupuncture analgesia:
1.  **Explanatory Work to the Patient**: Inform the patient in detail about the characteristics, methods, process, and effects of acupuncture analgesia, operative procedures, and needling sensations. This aims to mentally relax the patient and ensure cooperation, preventing negative psychological responses that could affect physiological function, pain endurance, and acceptance of the operation.
2.  **Preliminary Test of Needling and Pain Endurance**: Conduct a preliminary test on one or more points to allow the patient to experience needling sensations, reduce nervousness, and adapt to stimulation. This also helps the surgeon determine the appropriate method and intensity of stimulation, preventing inadequate or excessive stimulation during surgery.
3.  **Practice of Deep Breathing**: Instruct patients undergoing thoracic-abdominal operations to practice slow, deep abdominal breathing preoperatively. This helps relieve stuffiness, heavy sensation, and dyspnea after the chest is opened, and eases muscular spasm, nausea, and vomiting caused by retraction of internal organs in abdominal surgery.
4.  **Preoperative Plan of Acupuncture Analgesia**: Ensure indispensable close cooperation among acupuncturists, surgeons, and nursing staff. Thoroughly analyze the patient's psychological state, case history, and focus of infection. Predict potential intraoperative problems and prepare corresponding emergency measures to guarantee a safe operation on a fully conscious patient.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Clinical Remarks

1. Because the patient is fully conscious during the operation under acupuncture analgesia, surgeons should preoperatively make the whole procedure of the operation known to the patient so as to gain the patient's cooperation. Surgeons should have an amiable attitude, well-prepared measures, observing blood pressure, pulse and respiration rate attentively during the operation, and reducing the patient's discomforts as far as possible.
2. The patient's chief complaint should be attended during the operation. When discomfort occurs, appropriate measures should be taken in time to relieve it, and the patient should be comforted to maintain his confidence. The amount of the adjuvants should be proper, either overdose or underdose is harmful to the patient's health or to the proceeding of the operation.
3. In order to promote the effect and lessen the subcortex bleeding, an appropriate dosage of physiological saline with the addition of a little adrenal may be used subcutaneously in the incision region before the skin incision in some operations.
4. Patients may regain appetite and ambulatory activity soon after an operation under the guidance of the medical workers besides general nursing care, and those are conducive to an early recovery.
