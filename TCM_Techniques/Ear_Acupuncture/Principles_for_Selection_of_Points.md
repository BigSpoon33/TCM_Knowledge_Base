# ü©∫ Principles for Selection of Points

## üìñ Overview

This chapter outlines the fundamental principles for selecting auricular points in Traditional Chinese Medicine.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Selection based on disease location
- Selection based on TCM theories (Zang-fu, Meridians, Collaterals)
- Selection based on clinical experience
- Focus on auricular points

- Skin diseases
- Arrythmia
- Temporal headache
- Pain, redness and swelling of the eyes

**Tongue:** n/a
**Pulse:** n/a

#### TCM Analysis
Point selection is guided by the foundational theories of Zang-Fu organ functions, their external manifestations, and the distribution and relationships of meridians and collaterals.

---

### Pattern 3: Selection based on clinical experience

**Type:** N/A

#### Main Manifestations
- Pain, redness and swelling of the eyes
- Pain and swelling of the throat

**Tongue:** n/a

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Selection based on disease location

**Treatment Principle:** Select auricular points that correspond anatomically to the diseased areas.

**Needle Technique:** N/A

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Point Stomach]] | for gastralgia |
| [[Point Shoulder]] | for shoulder pain |

#### Explanation
Auricular points corresponding to the diseased areas are selected for treatment. For example, 'Point Stomach' is selected for gastralgia, and 'Point Shoulder' for shoulder pain, directly addressing the symptomatic area.

---

### Pattern: Selection based on TCM theories

**Treatment Principle:** Select corresponding auricular points based on the theories of Zang-Fu organs or meridians and collaterals.

**Needle Technique:** N/A

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Point Lung]] | for skin diseases because the lung dominates the skin and hair |
| [[Point Small Intestine]] | for arrythmia as the heart is exteriorly-interiorly related to the small intestine |
| [[Point Gallbladder]] | for temporal headache as the temporal region is supplied by the Gallbladder Meridian of Foot-Shaoyang |
| [[Point Liver]] | for pain, redness and swelling of the eyes, since the liver opens to the eyes |

#### Explanation
According to the theories of Zang-Fu or meridians and collaterals, corresponding auricular points are selected for treatment. For instance, 'Point Lung' for skin diseases (Lung dominates skin and hair); 'Point Small Intestine' for arrythmia (Heart-Small Intestine exteriorly-interiorly relationship); 'Point Gallbladder' for temporal headache (temporal region supplied by Gallbladder Meridian); 'Point Liver' for eye pain, redness, and swelling (Liver opens to the eyes).

---

### Pattern: Selection based on clinical experience

**Treatment Principle:** Utilize auricular points that have demonstrated efficacy through accumulated clinical experience for specific conditions.

**Needle Technique:** N/A

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Point Ear Apex]] | for pain, redness and swelling of the eyes |
| [[Points Helix 2, 4, and 6]] | for pain and swelling of the throat |

#### Explanation
Point selection can also be based on established clinical experience where certain points have proven effective for specific ailments. Examples include 'Point Ear Apex' for pain, redness and swelling of the eyes, and 'Points Helix 2, 4, and 6' for pain and swelling of the throat, based on their observed clinical efficacy.
