## 🛡️ Prevention & Prophylaxis

Patients, especially the aged and weak with hypertension and arteriosclerosis, should have proper rest before and after needling. Strict antisepsis is necessary to avoid infection of the auricle. Ear acupuncture is not advisable for women during pregnancy if there is a history of miscarriage.

---

## ⚠️ Clinical Remarks

While there are extensive indications for ear acupuncture, it still has its limitations. The therapeutic effects for some diseases are not satisfactory, or only symptomatic relief is achieved; therefore, in treating some disorders, it is necessary to combine other therapies. If sudden dizziness, nausea, stuffiness of the chest or other fainting symptoms occur during treatment, the patient should be managed in the same manner as during ordinary body acupuncture. During initial visits, patients should be in a reclining position to avoid fainting. In case of inflammation or redness of the needle hole or distension and pain of the auricle, timely and appropriate measures should be taken such as applying 2% iodine or oral administration of anti-inflammation drugs. Needling is contraindicated if frost-bite or inflammation is present on the auricle to avoid diffusion or inflammation.
