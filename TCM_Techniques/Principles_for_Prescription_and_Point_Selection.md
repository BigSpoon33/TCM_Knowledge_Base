## 🎯 Variations & Methods

### Big Prescription

Selection of a great number of points.

**Indications:** A wide range of disorders in the zang-fu organs, meridians and collaterals, such as hemiplegia caused by windstroke and epilepsy.

### Small Prescription

Selection of less points.

**Indications:** Common ailments, such as malaria and epigastric pain.

### Compound Prescription

Application of two or more than two groups of points with different functions.

**Indications:** Complicated cases which have two or over two symptoms simultaneously, for example, headache appearing at the same time with diarrhoea.

### Odd Prescription

Only one point is used.

**Indications:** Specific localized pain, e.g., Ximen (P 4) for cardiac pain, Shuigou (Du 26) for pain in the back and lumbar region.

### Even Prescription

A pair of points selected.

**Indications:** Combination of Back-(Shu) Point with Front-(Mu) Point, Yuan-(Primary) Point with Luo-(Connecting) Point, and points in the upper part with the Eight Confluent Points in the lower part of the body.

### Selection of nearby points

Selection of local area of the disease or the adjacent area of the disease

**Indications:** Nearby ailments

### Selection of distant points

Distant refers to a location far from the diseased area. Generally, these points are located below the elbows and knees

**Indications:** Points on the lower portion should be selected for the upper problems, points on the upper should be selected for the lower problems, and points on the side of the body should be selected for middle problems.

### Crossing Combination

Selecting points on the left side to treat disorders on the right side and vice versa.

**Indications:** Contralateral puncture

### Selection of symptomatic points

Selection of the corresponding points according to some prominent symptoms

**Indications:** Selection of the empirical points falls into this category. For example, Sifeng (Extra) is selected to treat infantile indigestion. Moxibustion applied to Erbai (Extra) is for hemorrhage of hemorrhoids
