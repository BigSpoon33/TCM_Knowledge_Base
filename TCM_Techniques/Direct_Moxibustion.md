# üîß Direct Moxibustion

## üìñ Overview

Direct moxibustion involves placing a moxa cone directly on the acupuncture point and igniting it. This method, traditionally favored, is divided into scarring and nonscarring types based on the presence of post-treatment scars.

## üéØ Variations & Methods

### Scarring Moxibustion

Moxa cone is placed on the point and ignited until it completely burns out, repeated five to ten times, leading to a local burn, blister, festering, and scar after healing.

**Indications:** Certain chronic diseases such as asthma.

### Nonscarring Moxibustion

Moxa cone is placed on a point and ignited. When half or two thirds of it is burnt or the patient feels a burning discomfort, remove the cone and place another one. No blister should be formed and there should be no festering and scar formation.
