## 🎯 Variations & Methods

### Reinforcing

Strengthens body resistance, zang-fu organs, and replenishes yin, yang, qi, and blood.

**Indications:** Deficiency syndromes

### Reducing

Dispels pathogenic factors and removes stagnation to restore body resistance.

**Indications:** Excess syndromes

### Warming

Warms the meridians, removes obstructions, warms and nourishes yang qi, warms the middle jiao to dispel cold, and restores yang from collapse.

**Indications:** Cold syndromes

### Clearing

Clears pathogenic heat for resuscitation and addresses heat syndromes.

**Indications:** Heat syndromes

### Ascending

Raises yang qi and lifts the zang-fu organs from sinking.

**Indications:** Failure of ascending pure yang and sinking of qi in the middle jiao

### Descending

Makes the upward perverted qi go down and subdues yang.

**Indications:** Upward perverted qi
