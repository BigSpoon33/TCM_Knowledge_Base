## 🎯 Variations & Methods

### Inserting the needle aided by the pressure of the finger of the pressing hand

Press beside the acupuncture point with the nail of the thumb or index finger of the left hand, hold the needle with the right hand and keep the needle tip closely against the nail, and then insert the needle into the point.

**Indications:** Suitable for puncturing with short needles such as for needling Neiguan (P 6), Zhaohai (K 6), etc.

### Inserting the needle with the help of the puncturing and pressing hands

Hold the needle tip with the thumb and index finger of the left hand, leaving 0.2–0.3 cm of its tip exposed, and hold the needle handle with the thumb and index finger of the right hand. As the needle tip is directly over the selected point, insert the needle swiftly into the skin with the left hand, meanwhile the right hand presses the needle downward to the required depth.

**Indications:** Suitable for puncturing with long needles, such as those used in needling Huantiao (G 30), Zhibian (B 54), etc.

### Inserting the needle with the fingers stretching the skin

Stretch the skin where the point is located with the thumb and index finger of the left hand, hold the needle with the right hand and insert it into the point rapidly to a required depth.

**Indications:** Suitable for the points on the abdomen where the skin is loose, such as Tianshu (S 25), Guanyuan (Ren 4), etc.

### Inserting the needle by pinching the skin

Pinch the skin up around the point with the thumb and index finger of the left hand, insert the needle rapidly into the point with the right hand.

**Indications:** Suitable for puncturing the points on the head and face, where the muscle and skin are thin, such as Zanzhu (B 2), Dicang (S 4), Yintang (Extra), etc.

### Perpendicular Insertion

Needle is inserted perpendicularly, forming a 90° angle with the skin surface.

**Indications:** Most points on the body

### Oblique Insertion

Needle is inserted obliquely to form an angle of approximately 45° with the skin surface.

**Indications:** Points close to important viscerae or where the muscle is thinner. Points such as Lieque (L 7) in the upper extremity, Jiuwei (Ren 15) of the abdominal region, Qimen (Liv 14) of the chest, and the points on the back.

### Horizontal Insertion (Transverse Insertion)

Needle is inserted almost parallel to the skin surface.

**Indications:** Areas where the muscle is thin, such as Baihui (Du 20), Touwei (S 8) on the head, Zanzhu (B 2), Yangbai (B 14) on the face, Tanzhong (Ren 17) on the chest, etc.

## ⚙️ Technical Parameters

**Depth:** Varies depending on the point, patient's constitution, and pathological condition. Shallow insertion is advisable for the elderly, infants, and areas such as the head, face, and back. Deep insertion is adopted for the young and middle-aged, and for points on the four extremities, buttocks, and abdominal region.

**Angle:** Perpendicular (90°), Oblique (45°), Horizontal (parallel)

**Duration:** Retaining the needle for fifteen to twenty minutes after the arrival of qi is common. The time for retaining of the needle may be appropriately prolonged for some chronic, intractable, painful and spastic cases. For some diseases the duration may last for several hours.

## ⚠️ Precautions

- Apply few needles or delay acupuncture treatment to patients who are famished, overeaten, intoxicated, overfatigued, or very weak.
- Do not puncture points on the lower abdomen and lumbosacral region for women pregnant under three months. After three months pregnancy it is contraindicated to needle the points on the upper abdomen and lumbosacral region, and those points causing strong sensation such as Hegu (LI 4), Sanyinjiao (Sp 6), Kunlun (B 60) and Zhiyin (B 67).
- Points on the vertex of infants should not be needled when the fontanel is not closed. Retaining of needles is forbidden for infants.
- Needling should avoid the blood vessels to prevent bleeding. Points of the chest and back should be carefully needled to avoid injury of the vital organs.
- Avoid puncturing or deep puncturing points close to the vital organs or large blood vessels, such as Chengqi (S 1), Jiuwei (Ren 15), Jimen (Sp 11), etc. Use oblique or horizontal insertion instead.
