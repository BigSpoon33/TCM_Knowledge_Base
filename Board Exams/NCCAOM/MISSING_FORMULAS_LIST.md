## Note on Coverage

**Current status**: 136/162 = 84% coverage

This is **STRONG coverage** for NCCAOM exam preparation. Most of the missing formulas are less frequently tested. The vault already contains:
- All major tonifying formulas
- Most exterior-releasing formulas  
- Most harmonizing formulas
- Key blood-invigorating formulas
- Essential Qi-regulating formulas

**Bottom line**: You can study effectively with current coverage. Adding the remaining formulas would be beneficial but is not critical for passing NCCAOM exams.
