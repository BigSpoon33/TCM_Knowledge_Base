## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

The name B«éihu√¨ DU-20 (Hundred Meetings) reflects the location of this point at the crown of the head which is the meeting of all the yang qi of the body, and its ability, according to the, Classic of Supplementing Life with Acupuncture and Moxibustion to treat the 'one hundred diseases'. Like many acupuncture points, B«éihu√¨ DU-20 has also been given a variety of alternative names in classical texts, reflecting different aspects of its nature. The name Sanyangwuhui (Three Yang Five Meetings) emphasises that B«éihu√¨ DU-20 is the meeting point of the Governing vessel with the three yang channels of the Bladder, Gall Bladder and Sanjiao, as well as the Liver channel. Another name, Niwangong (Mud Ball Palace), is used in qigong theory. Niwan (Mud Ball) refers to the material aspect of the spirit which is located in the brain (see also Sh√©nt√≠ng DU-24), and accordingly B«éihu√¨ DU-20 is sometimes considered to be the location of the upper dantian (cinnabar field). Further names include Tianshan (Mountain of Heaven) reflecting its location at the highest point of the body, and Guimen (Ghost Gate) reflecting its influence on psycho-emotional disorders.

B«éihu√¨ DU-20 is located at the apex of the head, the highest and hence most yang point of the body. It therefore has a profound effect on regulating yang, both to descend excess yang and to raise deficient yang. Interior wind is a yang pathogen characterised by vigorous upward movement and is most commonly generated when the Liver's spreading and rising movement exceeds its normal bounds. B«éihu√¨ DU-20, the meeting of the Governing and Liver channels, is able to descend such manifestations of interior wind and uprising of yang as windstroke, dizziness, tinnitus, headache, head wind, pain of the vertex, opisthotonos, lockjaw and loss of consciousness. A number of different classics state that B«éihu√¨ DU-20 should be bled in such excess patterns. The pronounced ability of this point to descend excess from the head should not obscure its importance in nourishing the brain. According to the Spiritual Pivot 41 B«éihu√¨ DU-20 is a point of the sea of marrow "Its point above is the top of the head; below it is Fengfu" and "When the sea of marrow is in excess then there is lightness of the body and much strength and a person's self exceeds the normal level; when the sea of marrow is insufficient there is a whirling sensation of the brain, tinnitus, pain of the lower legs, dizziness, impairment of vision, indolence and desire to sleep".

As well as treating disorders at the top of the body, B«éihu√¨ DU-20 is able to raise sinking of yang at the lower end of the Governing vessel leading to prolapse of the rectum. This action of raising yang has been extended in modern clinical practice to the treatment of prolapse of the uterus and vagina. For this purpose B«éihu√¨ DU-20 is often treated by moxibustion. Zhu Dan-xi recommends the application of three cones of moxa to B«éihu√¨ DU-20 for chronic disease with qi deficiency and incessant diarrhoea 42. All these indications reflect the principle stated in the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic 43 "When the disease is below select [points] from above".

This effect of raising yang is emphasised in qigong practice. Attention is focused on the upper dantian [either B«éihu√¨ DU-20 or Y√¨nt√°ng M-HN-3] in cases of sinking of qi, aversion to wind and cold in the head, hypotension etc., but contraindicated in cases of excessive yang, fire or wind. According to the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries "Heaven, earth and man are the three powers. B«éihu√¨ DU-20 ... echoes Heaven, Xu√°njƒ´ REN-21 ... echoes man and Y«íngqu«én KID-1 ... echoes the earth". It is by opening B«éihu√¨ DU-20 that we can better absorb the energy of heaven, and through focusing on Y«íngqu«én KID-1 that we can root to the energy of the earth. It is strongly emphasised, however, that since yang has a natural tendency to rise to the head, most people should first master sinking the qi to the lower dantian, in the lower abdomen, or to Y«íngqu«én KID-1, and circulating the qi through the small heavenly circuit (the Governing and Conception vessels) before focusing unduly on the upper dantian.

One of the most striking groups of indications found in classical texts for B«éihu√¨ DU-20 is disorders of the spirit and Heart, for example heat and oppression of the Heart, fright palpitations, poor memory, disorientation, sadness and crying with desire to die etc. As considered at length in the introductory discussion to the Governing vessel (above), this reflects the overlap between different theories in Chinese medicine concerning the residence of the spirit, some schools emphasising the Heart and others the brain. The Essential Questions for example states "The Heart stores the spirit" 44 and "The head is the residence of the intelligence" 45. As stated above, the Governing vessel, and B«éihu√¨ DU-20 in particular, has an especially close relationship with the brain. At the same time, the anterior pathway of the Governing vessel ascends through the Heart. The Governing vessel, therefore, can be seen as the channel which integrates these two theories, and B«éihu√¨ DU-20 may be selected especially when psycho-emotional disturbance manifests with indications of disharmony both of the Heart (palpitations, oppression etc.) and the head and brain (heaviness of the head, epilepsy, dizziness etc.)

From B«éihu√¨ DU-20, the Governing vessel starts to descend down the midline of the front of the head, traversing the nose. This point is therefore indicated for a variety of nasal disorders including discharge, obstruction and bleeding.

Finally, according to the Spiritual Pivot 46 B«éihu√¨ DU-20 is listed as one of a group of twenty-five points for treating headache caused by inversion qi (disordered and contrary flow of qi): Qi√°ngjiƒÅn DU-18, H√≤ud«êng DU-19, B«éihu√¨ DU-20, Qi√°nd«êng DU-21, X√¨nhu√¨ DU-22, W«îch√π BL-5, Ch√©ngguƒÅng BL-6, T≈çngtiƒÅn BL-7, Lu√≤qu√® BL-8, Y√πzhƒõn BL-9, T√≥ul√≠nq√¨ GB-15, M√πchuƒÅng GB-16, Zh√®ngy√≠ng GB-17, Ch√©ngl√≠ng GB-18 and N«éok≈çng GB-19.

Summary of clinical application

Treats the brain, Heart and spirit: heat and oppression of the Heart, fright palpitations, poor memory, disorientation, sadness and crying with desire to die.
Point of the Sea of Marrow: ‚ÄúIts point above is the top of the head; below it is Fƒìngf«î DU-16‚Äù; ‚ÄúWhen the sea of marrow is in excess then there is lightness of the body and much strength and a person‚Äôs self exceeds the normal level; when the sea of marrow is insufficient there is a whirling sensation of the brain, tinnitus, pain of the lower legs, dizziness, impairment of vision, indolence and desire to sleep‚Äù (Spiritual Pivot).
