## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Xīmén P-4 is the xi-cleft point of the Pericardium channel. The xi-cleft points are where the qi and blood, which flow relatively superficially along the channels from the jing-well points, gather and plunge more deeply. The xi-cleft points in general are indicated in the treatment of acute conditions and pain, whilst the xi-cleft points of the yin channels have an additional action of treating disorders of blood. Xīmén P-4 is an important point to treat both acute stasis of blood and heat in the blood.

Through its dual actions of invigorating blood and moderating acute conditions, Xīmén P-4 is a primary point for treating stagnation of blood in the chest and Heart, giving rise to acute pain which may radiate to the neck, back or left arm, or be accompanied by vomiting. Its important role in the treatment of Heart pain was both emphasised in the classics and is borne out by modern clinical practice and research.

By virtue of its ability to clear heat from the blood and stop bleeding, Xīmén P-4 is indicated for hot reckless bleeding in the upper jiao giving rise to nosebleed, and vomiting or coughing of blood.

The second principal group of indications for v includes a variety of mental and emotional disorders such as agitation of the Heart, insomnia, melancholy, and fear and fright of people. The relationship between Xīmén P-4 and emotional disorders is expressed through its effect on the blood and the Heart qi. The Heart rules the blood and houses the spirit, and there is therefore a reciprocal relationship between blood and disturbance of the spirit. On the one hand when the blood is stagnant and does not flow freely, essential nourishment will not reach the Heart and the Heart's function of housing the spirit may be disrupted. On the other hand, emotional disturbance may lead to stagnation of blood. The Spiritual Pivot5 states " ... Internally a person may be injured by worry and anger; when this occurs the qi will rebel upwards; when the qi rebels thus the six shu [points of the six channels] will not flow, the warm qi will not circulate and internally the congealed blood will coagulate and not scatter ...". By resolving stasis of blood Xīmén P-4 is able both to treat emotional disharmony and to resolve the Heart blood stasis that results from it.

Blood stasis in the Heart most commonly occurs as a result of deficiency of Heart qi and yang. These patterns frequently give rise to feelings of fear, melancholy and a diminished spirit, typically seen in patients after a myocardial infarct or cardiac surgery (the shock of which may further injure the Heart qi). Xīmén P-4 is able to regulate the Heart qi, as well as the blood, and is classically indicated for insufficiency of the spirit qi.

Finally there may be symptoms of mental and emotional agitation, as well as haemorrhage, when heat enters the nutritive or blood levels during febrile disease and rises to disturb the spirit. Thus the Treatise on Epidemic Warm Febrile Disease stated "When the nutritive system is invaded by heat, the blood is consumed, the spirit is disturbed and there is insomnia". Xīmén P-4 is able to calm the spirit in such cases by clearing heat from the nutritive and blood levels.

Summary of clinical application
Xi-cleft point for blood stasis in the chest and Heart: much used for acute pain which may radiate to the neck, back or left arm, or be accompanied by vomiting.
Xi-cleft point for haemorrhage due to heat (nosebleed, coughing or vomiting blood) and for heat entering the nutritive and blood levels.
