## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Liangmen ST-21 is an important point for treating distention and pain due to stagnation of qi, especially in the lateral abdomen and the lateral costal region. It is used in preference to, or in combination with, Zhongwan REN‑12 when there is severe epigastric and abdominal pain, particularly in these lateral regions.

More widely, Liangmen ST-21 is able to regulate the Stomach and Spleen and transform food accumulation, being indicated for vomiting, poor appetite, borborygmus, undigested food in the stool and diarrhoea, especially slippery diarrhoea. This term refers to diarrhoea which, because of its persistent and chronic nature, leads to downward collapse of qi. The collapse of qi in turn leads to a worsening of the diarrhoea which becomes ceaseless both at night and during the day, and is accompanied by symptoms such as shortness of breath, loss of appetite, emaciation etc.

The term ‘liang’ in the name of Liangmen ST-21 refers to one of the ‘five accumulations’ discussed in the Classic of Difficulties. This form of accumulation is said to pertain to the Heart and is characterised by a palpable mass in the region below the Heart (epigastrium), and the use of Liangmen ST-21 is emphasised in various classics for epigastric pain and qi accumulation below both the chest and lateral costal region.

Summary of clinical application
For pain and distention of the abdomen (especially the lateral abdomen), epigastrium and lateral costal region, particularly when due to qi stagnation.
Also for vomiting, poor appetite, undigested food in the stool and diarrhoea.
