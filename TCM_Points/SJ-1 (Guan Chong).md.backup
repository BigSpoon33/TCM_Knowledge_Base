## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

As the jing-well point, Guānchōng SJ-1 is the terminal point of the Sanjiao channel, and in common with the other jing-well points has its most powerful influence on the opposite end of the channel. The primary action of Guānchōng SJ-1 is in clearing heat affecting the upper jiao, and as a jing-well point it is mainly used for acute symptoms. This action is reflected in two main ways: i. clearing heat from the channel, and ii. treating febrile diseases of external origin.

The Song of the Jade Dragon recommends Guānchōng SJ-1 for 'congested Sanjiao heat in the upper jiao' and says "bleeding this point will remove toxic blood". The upper portion of the Sanjiao channel originates in the chest and ascends via the neck to the ear, temple, inferior aspect of the eye and outer canthus. If exterior heat (primarily wind-heat) or interior heat (mainly Liver heat which transmits to the foot shaoyang Gall Bladder channel and thence to the hand shaoyang Sanjiao channel) obstruct the Sanjiao channel there may be tinnitus, deafness, earache, headache, dizziness, redness of the eyes, throat painful obstruction etc. The Sanjiao sinew channel ascends to the root of the tongue and Guānchōng SJ-1 has a special affinity for this area. It is indicated for stiff tongue (usually due to heat injuring body fluids), curled tongue (usually due to excess or deficiency fire of the Heart) and cracked tongue (usually due to heat scorching body fluids), as well as pain at the root of the tongue.

There are three main systems for differentiating fevers in the corpus of Chinese medicine: i. according to the six channels, ii. according to the four levels, and iii. according to the sanjiao (three jiao). The sanjiao theory divides the body into three portions, the upper, middle and lower jiao. According to this method of differentiating fevers (developed by Wu Ju-tong in the Systematic Differentiation of Warm Diseases) the upper jiao corresponds to the Lung and Pericardium. The Warp and Woof of Warm Febrile Diseases explains "When a warm pathogen attacks the upper body, first it invades the Lung; it is then transmitted to the Pericardium". As far as exterior pathogenic heat attacking the Lung is concerned, this corresponds to the taiyang channel stage and the defensive level in the differentiations according to the six channels and the four levels respectively, and is the most exterior and superficial stage of fever, manifesting with chills and fever, headache, sore throat, and redness of the eyes. If exterior pathogenic heat penetrates deeper to attack the Pericardium, the heat condenses the body fluids to form phlegm. Phlegm-heat then obstructs the Pericardium and disturbs the spirit, giving rise to such symptoms as high fever with agitation, Heart pain, dry mouth with a bitter taste, and stiff or curled tongue. Since Guānchōng SJ-1 is able to dispel pathogenic heat and wind-heat from the upper jiao as a whole and from its interiorly-exteriorly coupled Pericardium channel in particular, it is therefore able to treat both these patterns.

It is interesting to note that in general, points of the Sanjiao channel treat fevers at the defensive and qi levels and the Lung pattern, whilst points of the Pericardium channel treat the nutritive and blood levels and the Pericardium pattern (see Discussion). Since the defensive level, qi level and Lung patterns are relatively more superficial and yang, this reflects the interior-exterior relationship of this yin-yang pair of channels. As the jing-well point of the Sanjiao channel where the qi of the Pericardium enters the Sanjiao, however, Guānchōng SJ-1 is ideally suited to treat both the Lung and Pericardium patterns.

Guānchōng SJ-1 is indicated in two other conditions. Firstly, acute disharmony of the Stomach and intestines manifesting as sudden turmoil disorder, vomiting of sour fluid and loss of appetite, reflecting the interior pathway of the Sanjiao primary channel to the middle and lower jiao. Secondly, it appears in a number of classical combinations for the treatment of wasting and thirsting disorder, reflecting its ability to clear heat and moisten dryness of the mouth and lips.
