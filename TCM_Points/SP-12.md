## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Ch≈çngm√©n SP-12 is a coalescent point of the Yin Linking vessel. The Classic of Difficulties says "When the Yin Linking vessel is diseased, Heart pain will result"19. Ch≈çngm√©n SP-12 (Rushing Gate), like Q√¨ch≈çng ST-30 (Rushing Qi), is indicated for foetal qi rushing up to the Heart. This condition, described by Zhu Dan-xi, manifests as distention, fullness and pain of the abdomen and Heart in a pregnant woman, and is common in the later stages of pregnancy.

Summary of clinical application
For foetal qi rushing up to the Heart: distention, fullness and pain of the abdomen and Heart in a pregnant woman. ‚ÄúWhen the Yin Linking vessel is diseased, Heart pain will result‚Äù (Classic of Difficulties).
Rarely used clinically.
