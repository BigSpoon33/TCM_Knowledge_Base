## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Fƒìiy√°ng BL-58 is the luo-connecting point of the Bladder channel. An examination of its modern application compared with its traditional indications reveals a significant disparity. Clinically it is most commonly used nowadays for disorders of the lower limb and lumbar pain, particularly for sciatic pain which is located either along the course of both the Bladder and Gall Bladder channels, or between these two channels. This reflects the location of Fƒìiy√°ng BL-58 at the place where the Bladder channel, which runs down the back of the leg from Ch√©ngf√∫ BL-36, passes laterally towards the Gall Bladder channel on the lower leg.

Its traditional indications however, show a much wider application, characterised by excess in the upper region, sometimes with accompanying deficiency below (a pattern which may explain the name of this point, 'Soaring Upwards' as well as its alternative name 'Flying Yang)'.

From Fƒìiy√°ng BL-58 the luo-connecting channel meets with the Kidney channel, strengthening the relationship between these coupled channels. According to the Guide to the Classics of Acupuncture "the luo-connecting points are located between two channels ... if they are punctured, symptoms of the interiorly-exteriorly related channels can be treated"69. When the Kidneys are depleted there may be deficiency below manifesting as lumbar pain, coldness of the lower part of the body, inability to stand and weakness of the legs. At the same time there may be excessive yang rising up the coupled Bladder channel to the head and manifesting as dizziness, headache, pain of the neck and occiput, heat in the head and nosebleed.

As the Bladder channel descends towards the foot, its points are increasingly indicated for disorders of the spirit such as mania, and Fƒìiy√°ng BL-58 is the first of these. The Bladder primary channel connects with the Governing vessel at points T√°od√†o DU-13, D√†zhuƒ´ DU-14, N«éoh√π DU-17 and B«éihu√¨ DU-20, where it enters the brain, whilst the Bladder divergent channel enters the Heart. Since both the brain and the Heart have been cited as the residence of the spirit in different traditions of Chinese medicine, these two channel pathways help explain the ability of points such as Fƒìiy√°ng BL-58 to calm the spirit and treat disorders of the brain such as mania and epilepsy.

When pathogenic factors, principally exterior wind, attack the taiyang channel they may give rise to chills and fever or fever with absence of sweating, as well as various symptoms affecting the head such as pain of the neck and occiput, heat in the head, nasal congestion and rhinitis, nosebleed and dizziness. Fƒìiy√°ng BL-58, a distal point of the foot taiyang channel, is able to expel pathogens from the channel, release the exterior and clear the upper portion of the channel.

The Bladder divergent channel encircles the anal region, and like Ch√©ngjƒ´n BL-56 and Ch√©ngshƒÅn BL-57, Fƒìiy√°ng BL-58 is classically indicated for the treatment of haemorrhoids, swollen and painful haemorrhoids and bleeding haemorrhoids.

Finally, the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion gives specific indications for excess and deficiency of the luo-connecting points. In the case of Fƒìiy√°ng BL-58, these are rhinitis with obstruction and pain of the head and back (excess); rhinitis with nosebleed (deficiency).

Summary of clinical application
For fullness above (heat in the head, headache, dizziness, pain of the neck and occiput, pain of the head and back, rhinitis, nosebleed, nasal congestion etc.) and deficiency below (lumbar pain, coldness of the lower part of the body, weakness of the legs etc.).
For sciatic pain which is located either along the course of both the Bladder and Gall Bladder channels, or between these two channels.
