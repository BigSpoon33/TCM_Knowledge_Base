## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Y√°ngf«î GB-38 is the fire and jing-river point of the Gall Bladder channel. According to the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion "when the Gall Bladder is excess reduce Y√°ngf«î GB-38". The main actions of Y√°ngf«î GB-38 are to clear stagnation and heat from the entire course of the Gall Bladder channel, clear shaoyang heat, and benefit the sinews and bones of the whole body.

In the head, Y√°ngf«î GB-38 is an important point for one-sided headache, principally due to Liver qi stagnation or uprising of Liver fire or Liver yang which transmit along the Gall Bladder channel. In the upper part of the chest, the Gall Bladder channel passes anterior to the axilla. When qi and phlegm stagnate (and in some cases transform into heat), usually due to emotional causes, there may be swelling and pain of the axilla or scrofula. In the chest and lateral costal region, Y√°ngf«î GB-38 is indicated when qi stagnates and gives rise to pain accompanied by sighing. In the lower body, Y√°ngf«î GB-38 is indicated for pain extending along the Gall Bladder channel on the lateral side of the lower limb and the lateral malleolus. If pain in any of these regions is severe, a blue-green (qing) colour may be seen on the complexion. This colour, frequently observed around the mouth, eyes, nose or temples, has traditionally been linked with Liver disorders, severe pain or cold in the body.

According to both the Spiritual Pivot16 and the Essential Questions17 "Taiyang is the opening, yangming is the closing and shaoyang is the pivot". The shaoyang is the pivot between the interior and the exterior and Y√°ngf«î GB-38 is indicated for the classic symptoms seen when a pathogenic factor lodges in this 'half-interior, half-exterior' portion. These include distinct alternating phases of chills and fever, bitter taste in the mouth, pain of the chest and lateral costal region and sighing. Malaria, for which this point is indicated, is a classic example of shaoyang pattern.

According to the Spiritual Pivot18 "When the disease is at the yin within yang (sinews and bones), needle the jing-river points of the yin channels". Although this passage emphasises the yin channels only, it is clear from an examination of the indications of Y√°ngf«î GB-38, the jing-river point of the yang Gall Bladder channel, that it is nevertheless an important point for wandering painful obstruction, contraction and pain of the sinews, and pain of the hundred joints (i.e. all the joints of the body). The Gall Bladder primary channel descends from ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13 to the sacral region, and Y√°ngf«î GB-38 is indicated for a sensation in the lumbar region as if one was sitting in water, severe lumbar pain, and lumbar pain like a small hammer in the middle of the back.

Summary of clinical application
For one-sided headache, principally due to Liver qi stagnation or uprising of Liver fire or Liver yang.
For pain of the chest and lateral costal region accompanied by sighing.
Clears pathogens from shaoyang: chills and fever, bitter taste in the mouth, pain of the chest and lateral costal region and sighing, malaria.
Important point for wandering painful obstruction (wind bi), contraction and pain of the sinews, pain of the ‚Äòhundred joints‚Äô, a sensation in the lumbar region as if one was sitting in water, severe lumbar pain, lumbar pain like a small hammer in the middle of the back.
