## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Guānmén ST-22 is included in two elegant combinations for the treatment of enuresis. Both also include Shénmén HE-7, reflecting the principle that the involuntary discharge of urine, especially during sleep, indicates a disorder of the spirit as much as a disorder of the urinary system.

Summary of clinical application
Rarely used.
Indicated for abdominal qi accumulation, sensation of qi moving in the abdomen, abdominal pain, abdominal distention and fullness, acute periumbilical pain, constipation, borborygmus, diarrhoea, dysenteric disorder, poor appetite, oedema, enuresis, phlegm malaria with cold shivering.
