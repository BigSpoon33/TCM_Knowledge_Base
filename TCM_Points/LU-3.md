## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the Discourse Into the Origins and Development of Medicine "The Lung is the delicate zang, neither heat nor cold is appropriate ... too hot and the fire will melt the metal and the blood will stir". As early as the Spiritual Pivot10 TiƒÅnf«î LU-3 was indicated for "Sudden and severe thirst, internal rebellion, Liver and Lung struggle against each other, blood overflows from the mouth and nose". This quotation is a clear reference to the pattern of Liver fire attacking the Lung. A branch of the Liver channel crosses the diaphragm and scatters in the Lung, and if Liver fire rushes upwards and scorches the Lung it may injure both the blood vessels (causing reckless pouring of blood from the mouth and nose), and the fluids (giving rise to thirst). At the same time there will usually be cough, which is characterised in this pattern by bouts of spasmodic coughing with a red face, or dyspnoea or asthma which is typically induced or worsened by frustration or anger.

The above passage in the Spiritual Pivot lists TiƒÅnf«î LU-3 among five 'Window of Heaven' points. TiƒÅnf«î LU-3 shares with these points the common actions of i. treating goitre due to stag-nation of qi and phlegm in the neck region, ii. descending the qi of the Lung, and iii. benefiting the sensory orifices, in this case the eyes (visual dizziness and short-sightedness). It is also interesting to note that its ability to treat goitre as well as eye diseases is shared by three points of the upper arm, TiƒÅnf«î LU-3, B√¨n√†o L.I.-14 and Q≈´yu√°n SI-13. There is no apparent explanation why these points, rather than more distal ones, should have such an action, and this is predominantly a reflection of empirical observation.

According to Chinese medicine the Lung stores the corporeal soul (po), one of the five aspects of the spirit (when this term is used in its widest sense). TiƒÅnf«î LU-3 'Palace of Heaven' is indicated for a range of psycho-emotional disorders characterised by sadness, weeping, disorientation and forgetfulness as well as for somnolence and insomnia.

TiƒÅnf«î LU-3 is also indicated for 'floating corpse ghost talk'. This term probably refers to the delirious speech seen in the terminal stages of pulmonary tuberculosis. Sun Si-miao in his Thousand Ducat Formulas specifically refers to 'melancholy crying ghost talk' in relation to this point, and it was this great physician himself who classified pulmonary tuberculosis (known at that time as feishi - flying corpse) as a disease of the Lung rather than one involving demonic possession. An alternative explanation is that the term does in fact refer to raving or nonsensical speech attributed to demonic possession. A contemporary book on Chinese folk beliefs11 explains "In cases where the ghost's (i.e. evil spirit's) influence was the result of a gradual process, the victim would initially be sad, sensitive, and withdrawn. As the ghost's powers over the victim's mind became stronger, he would begin to behave as if he were in a dream, talk about ghostly matters, or act as if he were conversing with ghosts".

Summary of clinical application

For Liver fire attacking the Lung: cough, asthma, wheezing, spitting blood, coughing blood. 
Treats the corporeal soul (po): sadness, weeping, insomnia, disorientation and forgetfulness. 
Window of Heaven point: goitre, and sense organ (eye) disorders.
