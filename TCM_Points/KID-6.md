## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 is the confluent point and according to a passage in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion also the luo-connecting point of the Yin Motility vessel. The Yin Motility vessel traverses the medial aspect of the leg, the perineum, chest and throat, whilst the Kidney primary channel traverses the abdomen, connects with the uterus, joins with the Heart and ascends along the throat. The action of Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 can best be understood in relation to three major functions: i. regulating the Yin Motility vessel and the Kidney channel, ii. nourishing yin and clearing deficiency heat from the throat, Heart, intestines, uterus and genitals, and iii. regulating the lower jiao.

In the Ode of the Obstructed River the use of Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 is referred to as one of the 'eight therapeutic methods'. In this description of the application of the eight confluent points of the extraordinary vessels to affect specific symptoms and areas of the body, Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 is indicated for throat wind (swelling and pain with difficulty in swallowing). Both the Yin Motility vessel and the Kidney channel pass through the throat. When heat deriving from yin deficiency scorches the throat, there may be swelling, dryness, redness and pain. This type of sore throat is characterised by its chronic and lingering nature, worsening in the evening and with tiredness, and Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 is the main distal point to treat this pattern. Such is its affinity for the throat region, however (due to its ability to clear and regulate both channels), that it may also be selected for any kind of sore throat, whether deficient or excess. It is also indicated for plumstone qi (globus hystericus), a sensation of throat blockage which worsens or ameliorates according to fluctuations in the emotional state and which is normally associated with stagnation of qi and phlegm.

The Yin Motility vessel connects with the Yang Motility vessel at the eyes at Jƒ´ngm√≠ng BL-1, and Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 is indicated for eye disorders such as redness and pain of the inner canthus and disturbance of the vision by spots and stars. According to the Spiritual Pivot16 "When the [taiyang Bladder] channel enters the brain it is divided into the Yin Motility and the Yang Motility, it is here that the yin and yang meet; yang enters the yin and yin moves outwards to the yang, meeting at the inner corner of the eye. When the yang is abundant, the eyes are staring open; when the yin is abundant, the eyes will be closed shut". This passage has been interpreted to explain the use of Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 for both insomnia (excessive opening of the eyes) and somnolence (excessive closing of the eyes). Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 is also classically indicated for night-time epilepsy, and Shƒìnm√†i BL-62, the confluent point of the Yang Motility vessel, is indicated for day-time epilepsy.

The Kidney primary channel enters the Heart which stores the spirit, whilst the Kidneys store the will. When the Kidneys and the Heart function harmoniously, the spirit and the will mutually support each other. As well as being able to treat epilepsy and sleeping disorders, Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 is used to restore communication between the Heart and Kidneys, especially when heat deriving from Kidney yin deficiency disrupts the spirit and gives rise to a variety of mental and emotional symptoms such as sadness, fright, insomnia and nightmares.

In the lower jiao Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 regulates the functions of the uterus, genitals and the two lower yin (anus and urethra). Its forte is to nourish yin and clear deficiency heat, but like many points of the Kidney channel it is also able to tonify yang and warm cold.

According to the Essential Questions17 "the vessel of the uterus connects with the Kidneys". The Kidneys dominate sexual development and are the origin of the Conception and Penetrating vessels, and normal functioning of the uterus depends in the first instance on a harmonious Kidney function. Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 is indicated for a wide variety of disorders of menstruation (irregular menstruation, amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea), fertility (chronic cold of the uterus leading to infertility) and childbirth (difficult labour, persistent flow of lochia, post-partum dizziness and pain).

In the treatment of genital disorders, Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 is predominantly indicated in heat patterns manifesting as genital itching, sudden involuntary erection, leucorrhoea and seminal emission. In the treatment of urinary disorders Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 is indicated for frequent or dribbling urination, enuresis and oedema, all manifestations of deficiency of Kidney qi or Kidney yang. Wang Tao of the Tang dynasty in Secrets of a Frontier Official specifically mentioned the use of this point in the treatment of dribbling urination in women.

Another important indication for Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 is constipation. Due to its properties of nourishing the Kidneys and clearing deficiency heat it is predominantly indicated for constipation due either to deficiency of yin or scorching of body fluids from prolonged heat in the intestines. Its frequent inclusion in classical combinations, however, reveal that it has long been considered an important distal point for any kind of constipation.

Finally Zh√†oh«éi KID-6 treats disorders along the course of the Kidney channel and the Yin Motility vessel, such as tightness and contraction of the inner aspect of the leg (a traditional indication of disorder of the Yin Motility vessel) and distention and fullness of the chest and abdomen.
