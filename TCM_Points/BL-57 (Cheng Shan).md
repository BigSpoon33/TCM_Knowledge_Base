## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Chéngshān BL-57 was included by Ma Dan-yang, the great physician of the Jin dynasty, among the 'eleven heavenly star points'67, his grouping of the most vital acupuncture points. Clinically, Chéngshān BL-57 is used in three principal situations: i. haemorrhoids, ii. contraction and pain of the calf, and iii. heel pain. The Bladder divergent channel winds around the anal region. Classically, Chéngshān BL-57 has been regarded as the primary distal point in the treatment of all kinds of haemorrhoids. For example, the Song to Keep Up Your Sleeve says "for the five types of haemorrhoids due to hot blood, select Chéngshān BL-57 and await disappearance of the disease without a trace", whilst Ma Dan-yang recommends it for " ... haemorrhoids and difficulty in defecation ... ".

Pain and contraction of the calf may be due to traumatic injury, painful obstruction, or the sequela of sudden turmoil disorder, but is most commonly encountered in the context of deficiency of Liver blood. The Essential Questions68 says "When a person sleeps the blood returns to the Liver". Pain and contraction of the calf therefore tends to occur at night when the body is at rest, the blood returns to the Liver, and the relative insufficiency of circulating blood is unable to nourish and soften the sinews and muscles of the extremities. This symptom is more commonly encountered in those who tend to suffer from blood deficiency, particularly women because of the loss of blood entailed in menstruation, and the elderly because of the inevitable decline of essence and blood inherent in ageing. Although having no action on the Liver blood itself, Chéngshān BL-57 is an important local point in the treatment of this disorder.

Heel pain may be due to traumatic injury, painful obstruction or Kidney deficiency. Chéngshān BL-57 is an important proximal point for this disorder and may be combined with other suitable points in the treatment of heel pain of whatever aetiology.

Finally, Ma Dan-yang and other classical sources emphasise the use of Chéngshān BL-57 in the treatment of lumbar pain. Clinically it is now more commonly used for sciatic pain radiating to the calf region.
