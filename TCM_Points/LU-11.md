## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Sh√†oshƒÅng LU-1123 is the jing-well point of the Lung channel, and in common with many of the jing-well points is an important point to revive collapse, being indicated for loss of consciousness (from windstroke) and cold or hot inversion.

The internal pathway of the Lung channel ascends, at its highest point, to the throat. As the terminal point of the Lung channel, Sh√†oshƒÅng LU-11 has a particularly strong action on the opposite end of the channel and may be needled or pricked to bleed in all acute disorders of the throat and surrounding tissues due to excess heat and fire poison. As well as simple sore throat due to attack by exterior wind-heat, Sh√†oshƒÅng LU-11 is indicated for mumps and 'childhood throat moth', a traditional disease category more or less corresponding to tonsillitis. To induce bleeding more easily from Sh√†oshƒÅng LU-11, the thumb and index fingers of one hand are used to grasp and engorge the patient's thumb, whilst using the other hand to prick the point. According to Master Zhu Dan-xi24 of the Jin-Yuan dynasty "recuperation instantly follows bleeding". Both Sh√†oshƒÅng LU-11 and Y√∫j√¨ LU-10 have an important effect on the throat. In comparison with Y√∫j√¨ LU-10, which is indicated for both excess and deficiency heat, Sh√†oshƒÅng LU-11 is generally used for more extreme conditions due only to excess.

The Classic of Difficulties25 states that jing-well points treat "fullness below the Heart". The region 'below the Heart' specifically refers to the apex of the epigastrium, but many of the jing-well points in fact treat stagnation and fullness throughout the chest region. Sh√†oshƒÅng LU-11 is indicated for fullness of the Heart and of the region below the Heart, accompanied by sweating. Its ability to treat stasis and heat in the Heart is further reflected by its indications for mania and agitation of the Heart. For this reason it was included under its alternative name of Gui-xin (Ghost Faith) among Sun Si-miao's 'thirteen ghost points' for the treatment of mania disorder and epilepsy.

Summary of clinical application
Jing-well point hence restores consciousness, e.g. loss of consciousness from windstroke.
Prick to bleed to clear heat from the Lung channel in the throat: acute swelling, congestion and pain of the throat, mumps.
Jing-well point and one of Sun Si-miao‚Äôs thirteen ‚Äòghost‚Äô points: fullness and agitation of the Heart, mania.
