## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Baihuanshu BL-30 is primarily used as a local point to activate the circulation of qi and treat pain of the lumbar region and sacrum, pain of the lumbar region and hip, and especially pain of the coccyx.

In common with many points located on the sacrum (see Ciliao BL-32) Baihuanshu BL-30 is also able to regulate the function of the uterus and genito-urinary system. It is specifically indicated for stopping leakage in the form of seminal emission and nocturnal emission, leucorrhoea and white turbid urine.

Summary of clinical application
Mainly used for local pain of the lumbar spine, sacrum and coccyx.
Also regulates the lower jiao: irregular menstruation, dysmenorrhoea, leucorrhoea, seminal emission, difficult defecation and urination, prolapse of the rectum, dark urine.
