## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the Classic of Difficulties18 "in cases of deficiency reinforce the mother, in cases of excess reduce the child". F√πli≈´ KID-7, the metal and hence ‚Äòmother' point of the Kidney water channel, is one of the foremost points to i. strengthen the Kidney function of dominating body fluids and regulating urination, and ii. control sweating.

Oedema has various and complex causes. It may be due to internal or external disharmony and may be acute or chronic. However it predominantly involves disharmony of the Lung, Spleen and Kidneys, the three zang responsible for the movement of fluids. Acute oedema occurs when exterior pathogens lodge in the superficial portion of the body, initially impairing the defensive qi and the Lung function of regulating the water passages. The treatment method is to regulate Lung qi and promote sweating. Alternatively, acute oedema may be due to exterior patho-gens which penetrate from the taiyang channel (the most exterior of the six channels) to the taiyang fu, impairing the qi transformation function of the Bladder and leading to difficult urination. F√πli≈´ KID-7 has application in both types of acute oedema by virtue of its dual actions of promoting sweating and urination. Chronic oedema most commonly derives from qi or yang deficiency of the Spleen or Kidneys. Since Kidney yang is the root of Spleen yang, F√πli≈´ KID-7 which is able to tonify Kidney yang and promote urination, may be used in both these types of chronic oedema. In summary, F√πli≈´ KID-7 may be used in any type of oedema but due to its action on the Kidneys, is particularly indicated for chronic lower body oedema.

A special property of F√πli≈´ KID-7 is its ability to control sweating. One explanation of this action is the relationship between the Kidneys and the defensive qi, whose principal functions are to warm and protect the exterior and govern the opening and closing of the pores. There is some disparity in the discussion about the origin of the defensive qi in a variety of classical texts, for example "The Lung controls qi and pertains to defensive qi" (Warp and Woof of Warm Febrile Diseases), "Defensive qi is the brave qi of water and grain of yangming, it emanates from the upper jiao" (Collected Annotations on the Yellow Emperor's Canon of Internal Medicine), "The Stomach is the source of defensive [qi]" (Wang Jiu-feng's Medical Records) and "Defensive qi emanates from the lower jiao" (Spiritual Pivot19). However a modern Chinese text20 explains this problem as follows "Defensive qi has its source in the lower jiao, is nourished in the middle jiao and issues from the upper jiao".

Defensive qi is considered to be a part of the original qi which has its origin in the Kidney's pre-heaven qi (lower jiao). It is constantly nourished by the post-heaven essence of water and grain produced by the action of the Stomach and Spleen on food (middle jiao). Finally, it is the Lung which controls the defensive qi and spreads it to the surface of the whole body (upper jiao). It is therefore said that the root of the defensive qi is in the lower jiao, it is nourished by the middle jiao and it spreads in the upper jiao, and this is clarified by the observation that a person's defensive qi may be insufficient due to congenital weakness, inadequate diet or upper jiao deficiency. By virtue of its action on the Kidneys, and hence the source of the defensive qi, F√πli≈´ KID-7 has a wide application in regulating the opening and closing of the pores and treating disorders of sweating (see combinations below). It is able to induce sweating in exterior patterns, stop spontaneous sweating due to qi deficiency, and treat night sweating. Night sweating is most commonly due to fire from yin deficiency. Once again, the ability of F√πli≈´ KID-7 to treat night sweating due to yin deficiency, despite the fact that its primary action is on assisting the Kidney yang function of regulating fluid, demonstrates that all Kidney channel points have some action on both Kidney yin and Kidney yang. In the case of F√πli≈´ KID-7 the ability to nourish yin is further demonstrated by its applicability in the treatment of such symptoms as dry tongue and parched mouth.

It is interesting to note that F√πli≈´ KID-7 is also traditionally indicated for various kinds of bleeding including blood in the urine, blood in the stool, bleeding haemorrhoids, nosebleed, uterine bleeding and menorrhagia. This may reflect the ability of F√πli≈´ KID-7 to astringe blood in the same way that it astringes sweating.

The Kidneys and Bladder are interiorly-exteriorly related. One of the most common pathologies of the Bladder is accumulation of damp-heat giving rise to a variety of urinary symptoms characterised by frequency, urgency, pain, concentrated urine etc. In clinical practice, repeated attacks of Bladder damp-heat often involve underlying Kidney deficiency. By virtue of its dual actions of regulating the Kidneys and draining damp-heat by moving and adjusting the water passages, F√πli≈´ KID-7 is particularly suited to treat these situations.

The damp-heat draining action of F√πli≈´ KID-7 also extends to the intestines, where it is indicated for diarrhoea, dysenteric disorder, pus and blood in the stool, bleeding haemorrhoids etc.

F√πli≈´ KID-7 is commonly used to strengthen the lumbar region in lumbar disorders, particularly when due to Kidney deficiency, although Methods of Acupuncture and Moxibustion from the Golden Mirror of Medicine specifically recommends it for lumbar pain due to qi stagnation.

Finally both the Kidney primary and divergent channels ascend to the root of the tongue and the Spiritual Pivot21 states that the jing-river points should be needled for changes manifesting in the patient's voice. F√πli≈´ KID-7, the jing-river point of the Kidney channel, is indicated for dry tongue and parched mouth, dry tongue with Stomach heat, curled tongue with inability to speak, propensity to anger with incessant talking and propensity to laughter.

Summary of clinical application
Important point to treat oedema and regulate urination: ‚Äòthe five types of oedema‚Äô, oedema of the four limbs with drum distention, oedema of the lower limb, difficult urination, dark urine, ‚Äòthe five kinds of painful urinary dysfunction‚Äô (qi, blood, stone, turbid and taxation types).
Important point to control sweating: spontaneous sweating, night sweating, ceaseless sweating, fever without sweating.
Drains damp-heat: diarrhoea, dysenteric disorder, pus and blood in the stool, bleeding haemorrhoids.
