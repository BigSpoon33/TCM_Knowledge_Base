## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Z√∫l√≠nq√¨ GB-41 is an indispensable point to spread the Liver qi, especially when qi stagnation manifests along the course of the Gall Bladder channel, and this action underpins all the indications of this point. Although the primary cause of Liver qi stagnation is emotional, it may manifest both with physical symptoms and emotional changes. Z√∫l√≠nq√¨ GB-41 predominantly treats the physical symptoms of Liver qi stagnation, namely distention, pressure and pain along the Gall Bladder channel in the chest, head, eyes, breast, lateral costal region and axilla.

The smooth flow of Liver qi assists the ascending and descending of the qi of all the zangfu. If Liver qi stagnates in the chest region, therefore, it may hinder the descent of Lung qi and prevent smooth respiration. As well as fullness of the chest, chest painful obstruction and dyspnoea, there may be inability to catch the breath. This symptom, which may be described by the patient as a kind of breathlessness, is more an abnormal awareness of breathing accompanied by a feeling that the Lungs cannot be filled adequately.

If Liver qi stagnation transforms to Liver fire, or if Liver fire subsequently consumes yin and leads to uprising of Liver yang, the fire or yang may ascend to the head along the Gall Bladder channel (occiput, temporal region and ears) or the Liver channel (vertex) and cause pain, dizziness, tinnitus or even deafness. Although Z√∫l√≠nq√¨ GB-41 is much used in modern clinical practice for one-sided headache, particularly with W√†iguƒÅn SJ-5 and especially for headaches associated with the menstrual cycle, it is interesting to note that all major classical references are to occipital pain and pain of the vertex.

In the Ode of the Obstructed River the use of Z√∫l√≠nq√¨ GB-41 is referred to as one of 'the eight therapeutic methods'. In this description of the application of the eight confluent points of the extraordinary vessels to affect specific symptoms and areas of the body, Z√∫l√≠nq√¨ GB-41 is indicated for disorders of the eyes. The Liver 'opens' into the eyes, and the Liver, Gall Bladder and Gall Bladder divergent channels all connect with the eye. When Liver fire or Liver yang rise to disturb the eyes, or exterior wind-heat enters the Liver channel, there may be lacrimation or dry eyes, redness, swelling and pain of the eyes, especially at the outer canthus, or visual dizziness. Z√∫l√≠nq√¨ GB-41, as the name (Foot Governor of Tears) implies, is an important point to adjust the fluid in the eye and treat these conditions.

Z√∫l√≠nq√¨ GB-41 is the confluent point of the Girdling vessel which encircles the waist and binds the Penetrating and Conception vessels and the Kidney, Liver and Spleen channels, all of which channels influence the menstrual cycle. Furthermore, the Gall Bladder primary channel descends through the chest region, the Gall Bladder sinew channel links with the breast, and the nipples are ascribed to the jueyin Liver channel. Z√∫l√≠nq√¨ GB-41 is particularly used therefore in situations where Liver qi stagnation impairs the regularity of the menstrual cycle, and more especially for symptoms of stagnant qi such as distention and pain of the breast and headache which precede the menstrual period. Z√∫l√≠nq√¨ GB-41 is also indicated for breast abscess and is combined in a modern prescription with GuƒÅngm√≠ng GB-37 to stop lactation. After needling, moxibustion is applied to the points for ten minutes.

Liver qi stagnation may impair the smooth circulation of fluids resulting in their condensation into phlegm, or may transform into fire which scorches and condenses the body fluids leading to the formation of phlegm. Z√∫l√≠nq√¨ GB-41 is indicated when phlegm and stagnant qi combine to form swelling and nodules in the neck, breast and axilla.

Finally, Z√∫l√≠nq√¨ GB-41 is used for swelling and pain of the feet (especially the dorsum) and pain and contraction of the toes. According to Investigation into Points Along the Channels Z√∫l√≠nq√¨ GB-41 is suitable for ‚Äúall disorders of the feet‚Äù.
