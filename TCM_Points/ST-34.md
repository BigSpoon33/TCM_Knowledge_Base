## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Li√°ngqi≈´ ST-34 is the xi-cleft point of the Stomach channel and is the only one of the xi-cleft points of the twelve primary channels which is located proximal to the knee or elbow. It is an important adjacent point in the treatment of knee disorders (often combined with such points as Xiyan (MN-LE-16), Xu√®h«éi SP-10, Yƒ´nl√≠ngqu√°n SP-9 and Y√°ngl√≠ngqu√°n GB-34) and for painful obstruction, cold and pain of the leg.

The xi-cleft points are where the qi and blood, which flow relatively superficially along the channels from the jing-well points, gather and plunge more deeply. The xi-cleft points in general are indicated in the treatment of acute conditions and pain. The yangming Stomach channel traverses the breast and passes through the nipple, and Li√°ngqi≈´ ST-34 is classically indicated for such acute disorders of the breast as swelling, pain and abscess. In clinical practice it is also used for acute epigastric pain, although this seems to be a modern rather than traditional usage.

Summary of clinical application
Xi-cleft point of the Stomach channel: acute epigastric pain, breast pain and breast abscess.
Adjacent point for knee disorders.
