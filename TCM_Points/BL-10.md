## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

TiƒÅnzh√π BL-10 is one of five points referred to in Chapter 21 of the Spiritual Pivot as points of the 'Window of Heaven' (see Point Categories for a fuller discussion), and in this passage it is said "Sudden contraction, epilepsy and dizziness, with inability of the legs to support the body, select TiƒÅnzh√π BL-10". Chapter 24 of the Spiritual Pivot says "inversion headache with neck pain followed by lumbar pain select TiƒÅnzh√π BL-10"

In common with the other Window of Heaven points, TiƒÅnzh√π BL-10 is indicated when inversion qi (chaotic and rebellious qi) rises to the head. This may give rise to dizziness, headache, heaviness of the head, stiff neck and epilepsy, as well as congestion, pain and swelling of the throat, eyes and nose, whilst at the same time in the lower part the legs are unable to support the body due to unbalanced distribution of qi.

The use of TiƒÅnzh√π BL-10 for disorders such as inability of the legs to support the body, pain of the body, and headache accompanied by lumbar pain is a reflection of the principle of selecting points above to treat disorders below.

Like TiƒÅnf«î LU-3 and TiƒÅnchuƒÅng SI-16 (also points of the Window of Heaven), TiƒÅnzh√π BL-10 is further indicated for mental disorders characterised by mania and incessant talking, as well as for disorders characterised in the classical texts as seeing or 'communicating with ghosts' and therefore attributed to some form of demonic possession. In terms of modern medicine these indications refer to various forms of severe mental disorder including schizophrenia.

Finally there is some similarity between the indications of TiƒÅnzh√π BL-10 and Fƒìngch√≠ GB-20, both points being located close to each other. Fƒìngch√≠ GB-20 however is much used clinically both to expel exterior pathogenic wind and to pacify interior wind, whilst the clinical use of TiƒÅnzh√π BL-10 is primarily confined to pacifying interior wind.

Summary of clinical application
Window of Heaven point for qi rebelling to the head: dizziness, headache, heavy head, stiff neck, pain and swelling of the throat, eyes and nose, inability of the legs to support the body.
For mania, incessant talking, ‚Äòseeing ghosts‚Äô and epilepsy.
