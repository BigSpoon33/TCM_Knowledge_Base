## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The Classic of Difficulties6 says “ The Sanjiao is the envoy of the original qi ... the places where the original qi resides are known as the yuan source [points]”. This passage therefore implies both that the original qi resides at the yuan-source points and that the Sanjiao is the transmitter of the original qi. As the yuan-source point of the Sanjiao channel, therefore, there is every reason to expect that Yangchi SJ-4 would be an important point to strengthen the original qi in the treatment of diseases of deficiency, and Yangchi SJ-4 is used for exactly this purpose in the Japanese tradition of acupuncture. It has also been suggested that Yangchi SJ-4 is effective to regulate the Conception and Penetrating vessels in the treatment of disordered menstruation. Examining the classical Chinese records on the use of Yangchi SJ-4, however, the following observations may be made: i. it appears in very few traditional combinations, ii. there are very few indications or combinations reflecting its effectiveness in tonifying deficiency, and iii. it has no gynaecological indications. It is interesting to note also that Zhigou SJ-6, rather than Yangchi SJ-4, is indicated for 'blockage of the Conception vessel in women'.

In clinical practice, Yangchi SJ-4 is principally used for local disorders of the wrist joint, including redness, swelling, weakness and pain.

Finally, in learning the names of the points of the yang channels at the wrist, it is helpful to remember their similarity: Yangxi L.I.-5 (Yang Stream), Yanggu SI-5 (Yang Valley) and Yangchi SJ-4 (Yang Pool).

In learning the names of the points of the yang channels at the wrist, it is helpful to remember their similarity: Yángxī L.I.-5 (Yang Stream), Yánggǔ SI-5 (Yang Valley) and Yángchí SJ-4 (Yang Pool).
