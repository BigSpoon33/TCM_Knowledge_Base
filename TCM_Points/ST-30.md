## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

The name of this point Qichong may be translated as 'Rushing Qi' or 'Pouring Qi'. The character 'chong' is the same as in the Penetrating vessel (chong mai). This name reflects both the ability of Q√¨ch≈çng ST-30 to regulate the circulation of qi in the lower abdomen and its status as the point where the Penetrating vessel emerges on the abdomen. Q√¨ch≈çng ST-30 has a broad action in treating many disorders affecting this area. By regulating qi, Q√¨ch≈çng ST-30 may be used to disperse stagnation, pain, cold and heat in the genital region, intestines, Bladder and the abdomen as a whole, and is indicated for such disorders as pain, fullness and distention of the lower abdomen, abdominal heat, twisting pain of the abdomen, heat in the Large Intestine, retention of urine and faeces, hot painful urinary dysfunction, stone oedema etc.

The Penetrating vessel emerges at the perineum and meets the Stomach yangming channel at Q√¨ch≈çng ST-30. The Penetrating vessel influences the lower abdomen as a whole, including the genital organs, and especially helps regulate the function of the uterus and menstruation. Q√¨ch≈çng ST-30 is therefore indicated for such genital disorders as swelling and pain of the penis and vagina, pain and retraction of the testicles, impotence etc., and such gynaecological and obstetrical disorders as irregular menstruation, sudden amenorrhoea, abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, retention of the placenta and difficult lactation.

According to the Classic of Difficulties, when the Penetrating vessel is diseased, there will be upsurging qi and acute abdominal disturbance. Q√¨ch≈çng ST-30, located on the lower abdomen and the point where the Penetrating vessel emerges, is the single most important point in the treatment of running piglet qi. According to the Essentials from the Golden Cabinet "Running piglet disorder arises from the lower abdomen; it rushes up to the throat with such ferocity that the patient feels he is close to death. It attacks and then remits. It is brought about by fear and fright". Running piglet qi primarily arises when stagnant Liver qi transforms to heat, or when Kidney yang deficiency leads to accumulation of cold in the lower jiao. In both cases, qi is violently discharged and rushes upwards along the Penetrating vessel causing great agitation and anxiety. Q√¨ch≈çng ST-30 is also indicated for foetal qi rushing up to the Heart. This condition, described by Zhu Dan-xi, manifests as distention, fullness and pain of the abdomen and Heart in a pregnant woman.

In the chapter 'Discourse On the Seas' in the Spiritual Pivot17 Q√¨ch≈çng ST-30 is given as the upper point of the 'sea of water and grain' (Z√∫sƒÅnl«ê ST-36 is the lower point). According to this passage, when the sea of water and grain is in excess, there is abdominal fullness, and when it is deficient there is hunger with inability to eat. Finally, the Essential Questions18 includes Q√¨ch≈çng ST-30 among the eight points to clear heat from the Stomach (bilateral Q√¨ch≈çng ST-30, Z√∫sƒÅnl«ê ST-36, Sh√†ngj√πx≈´ ST-37 and Xi√†j√πx≈´ ST-39).

Summary of clinical application
Disperses stagnation and pain, cold and heat, in the lower abdomen, the male and female genital regions, the uterus, intestines and Bladder: hypogastric pain, fullness, distention twisting pain and heat in the abdomen, hardness below the umbilicus, retention of urine and faeces, heat in the Large Intestine, prolapse of the rectum, hot painful urinary dysfunction, irregular menstruation, sudden amenorrhoea, abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, retention of the placenta, swelling and pain of the external vagina, swelling and pain of the penis, pain of the testicles, retraction and pain of both testicles, shan disorder, impotence.
