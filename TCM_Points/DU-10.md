## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The name Lingtai (Spirit Tower) is a traditional term for the Heart and has come to denote the reasoning faculty. It originated with the Spirit Tower built by the emperor Wen Wang as a vantage point to survey all that lay beneath him. Despite this name and the fact that Língtái DU-10 is located one vertebra below Xīnshū BL-15, the back-shu point of the Heart, there are no indications or combinations reflecting this association in any major classic.

Língtái DU-10 is an empirical point in the treatment of furuncle and red-thread furuncle (lymphangitis) as well as for clove sores (small, hard, deep-rooted, clove-shaped purulent lesions), and is used for this purpose in modern clinical practice. It is also indicated in the Essential Questions31 for heat in the Spleen. This indication clearly fell out of favour and was not mentioned in subsequent texts.

Summary of clinical application
Empirical point for furuncle, red-thread furuncle (lymphangitis) and clove sores (small, hard, deep-rooted, clove-shaped purulent lesions).
