Note: the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, and Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man all say that this point should not be treated by moxibustion otherwise emaciation and death will follow within three years. Modern sources however agree that there are no contraindications to moxibustion.
