## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Xi√†w«én REN-10 (Lower Cavity) is also known as Xiaguan (Lower Controller). This point was traditionally considered to affect the lower portion of the Stomach, whilst Sh√†ngw«én REN-13 (Upper Cavity) was considered to affect its upper portion. Between these two points lies Zh≈çngw«én REN-12 (Middle Cavity). The Spiritual Pivot 17 states "When there is difficult ingestion and obstruction in the diaphragm, this indicates the pathogen is in the Stomach. When the disorder is in the upper cavity, then needle Sh√†ngw«én REN-13 to restrain the rebellion and descend it. When the disorder is in the lower cavity, then needle Xi√†w«én REN-10 to scatter and move it". The Song More Precious Than Jade says "when the Stomach is cold, Xi√†w«én REN-10 is excellent" whilst the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion states " Xi√†w«én REN-10 is the main point to use when food and drink are not digested and regurgitated after ingestion".

The principal use of this point is in cases of food stagnation with such symptoms as abdominal fullness, epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting after eating, lack of appetite, and undigested food in the stools.

Summary of clinical application
For food stagnation: ‚ÄúWhen there is difficult ingestion and obstruction in the diaphragm, this indicates the pathogen is in the Stomach ... when the disorder is in the lower cavity, then needle Xiawan REN-10 to scatter and move it‚Äù (Spiritual Pivot). For abdominal fullness, epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting after eating, lack of appetite, undigested food in the stools.
