## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Xīnshū BL-15 is the back-shu point of the Heart, where the qi of the Heart emanates from the interior to the body surface, and in common with all the back-shu points (especially those of the yin zang) Xīnshū BL-15 has a strong action on regulating and tonifying its corresponding zangfu at the deepest level. It is used equally to tonify deficiency (the Heart is unique amongst the zangfu in that it commonly suffers from all the four main kinds of deficiency: blood, yin, qi and yang), and to resolve excess pathogenic factors such as blood stasis, Heart fire and obstruction by phlegm.

According to the Essential Questions "The Heart is the monarch from which the spirit emanates"11 and "The Heart stores the spirit"12. Since storage is a yin function, it is primarily the Heart blood and yin that have the function of nourishing the Heart and providing the material basis for the Heart to house the spirit. Blood and yin deficiency of the Heart may originate from physical causes such as loss of blood, chronic illness and overwork or from emotional causes. Fei Bo-xiong 13 said "The seven emotions injure the five yin organs selectively but they all affect the Heart". According to the Essential Questions14 "The Heart stores the spirit ... when the spirit is insufficient there is sadness". When Heart blood or yin are deficient, the malnourished and unrooted spirit loses its harmony and becomes restless and unquiet, resulting in such symptoms as anxiety, poor memory, fearfulness, insomnia, excessive dreaming and weeping with grief. According to Essential Readings from the Medical Tradition "That which is stored by the Heart internally is blood, externally it is emitted as sweat; sweat is the fluid of the Heart". Xīnshū BL-15 is also indicated for night sweating due to deficiency of either Heart blood or Heart yin, and is therefore ideally suited to treat the commonly encountered pattern of excessive dreaming, or waking with anxiety, accompanied by sweating.

The Heart controls the pulse, and when Heart qi is deficient and is unable to regulate the blood, there may be palpitations or irregular pulse, especially if the Heart blood is also deficient. In the latter case, palpitations will be more likely to be accompanied by anxiety, in contrast to the palpitations caused purely by qi deficiency which are usually unrelated to emotional changes. In fact palpitations may accompany any pattern of Heart disharmony, whether excess or deficient, and in all these cases Xīnshū BL-15 may be selected.

References to the relationship between the Heart, the blood and its vessels abound in the classics. The Essential Questions says "All blood pertains to the Heart"15, "The Heart dominates the blood vessels of the entire body"16 and "The Heart stores the qi of the blood vessels"17. The Classic of Categories states "The vessels are the pathways of the blood qi, the movement of the vessels is dependent on qi", whilst in the Spiritual Pivot18 it says "When the qi of hand shaoyin channel is exhausted, the vessels are not open, thus the blood will not flow; when the blood does not flow the circulation will eventually stop ... and the blood will die". The above statements all emphasise the close relationship between the circulation of blood, and the qi and yang of the Heart. Clinically this relationship is most clearly manifested in the chest region. When Heart yang is deficient and unable to circulate the blood in the chest and Heart, there may be consequential Heart blood stasis giving rise to pain and oppression. In clinical practice, this pattern is often complicated by deficiency of qi, blood or yin, or stagnation of qi or phlegm. Whatever the pattern, Xīnshū BL-15 is an essential point.

The action of Xīnshū BL-15 in treating blood stasis reflects its ability to treat both deficiency and excess patterns of the Heart with equal effect. According to a number of classics it is an important point to clear heat of excess or deficiency type from the Heart. The heat-clearing effect of Xīnshū BL-15 extends to the treatment of bleeding, and when Heart fire injures the blood vessels of the Lung or Stomach there may be coughing or vomiting of blood. A different explanation of these symptoms is offered by the Investigation Into Points Along the Channels which says that Xīnshū BL-15 is indicated for "Heart blood unable to enter the Liver; in the upper, there is wild movement, in the lower there is blood in the stools".

The heat-clearing action of Xīnshū BL-15 finds its most important expression in the treatment of excess type psycho-emotional disorders. When Heart fire rages out of control it agitates and excites the spirit leading to such symptoms as severe insomnia and excessive dreaming. When Heart fire combines with phlegm and obstructs the portals of the Heart, there will be severe disorders of the spirit such as epilepsy, dementia, mad walking and mania-depression.

The heat clearing action of Xīnshū BL-15 extends beyond the Heart itself, and the Illustrated Supplement to the Classic of Categories states that Xīnshū BL-15 is one of five points (Fèishū BL-13, Xīnshū BL-15, Gānshū BL-18, Píshū BL-20 and Shènshū BL-23) which "drain heat from the five zang".

Seminal emission may present in a number of different patterns and is broadly differentiated into seminal emission accompanied by dreaming and seminal emission without dreams. Seminal emission with dreams may be due to Heart fire, Heart and Spleen deficiency, Heart and Kidney deficiency, ministerial fire or damp-heat. Even in cases where the Heart is not directly involved, however, if seminal emission is accompanied by erotic dreams, Xīnshū BL-15 is indicated.

Finally, in common with most of the yin back-shu points, Xīnshū BL-15 is able to treat the tissues and sense organs associated with its corresponding zang. The tongue is the 'sprouting forth' of the Heart and Xīnshū BL-15 is indicated for slow speech development in children and lack of strength in the root of the tongue. Xīnshū BL-15 is also indicated for lacrimation and eye pain. These indications however, reflect disorder of the Heart channel rather than the Heart zang.

Summary of clinical application
Heart back-shu point for all Heart patterns, both deficient and excess: Heart pain, palpitations, fright palpitations, irregular pulse, Heart qi deficiency in children, pain and oppression of the chest, chest pain extending to the back, worried and oppressive sensation of the chest with inability to catch the breath.
Important point to regulate the spirit: poor memory, anxiety, weeping with grief, cautiousness and fear with Heart deficiency, insomnia, excessive dreaming, disorientation, delayed speech development, mania-depression, epilepsy, dementia, mad walking.
