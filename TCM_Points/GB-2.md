## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

There are three points anterior to the tragus of the ear, Tƒ´nghu√¨ GB-2 inferiorly, ƒörm√©n SJ-21 superiorly and Tƒ´ngg≈çng SI-19 in the centre. All are frequently employed in the treatment of a wide variety of ear disorders, including tinnitus, deafness, pain, itching and discharge. Due to the close proximity of these points and the similar indications for each, it is difficult to distinguish between them clinically, although each practitioner may have their individual preference. If it is necessary to needle points around the ear regularly, then these three points should be alternated.

In addition to its ability to treat ear disorders, Tƒ´nghu√¨ GB-2 is able to eliminate wind and to activate the channel in the surrounding region, and is indicated for deviation of the mouth and eyes, mumps, toothache, and difficult mastication and other jaw disorders.

Summary of clinical application
Important point for a wide variety of ear disorders, including tinnitus, deafness, pain, itching and discharge.
Eliminates wind and activates the channel: deviation of the mouth and eyes, mumps, toothache, difficult mastication and other jaw disorders.
