## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Jiāoxìn KID-8 is the xi-cleft point of the Yin Motility vessel which originates at Zhàohǎi KID-6. The xi-cleft points of the yin channels have a special action of treating disorders of blood, especially resolving blood stasis, clearing heat from the blood and stopping bleeding. Although the Yin Motility vessel does not enter the uterus, like all the extraordinary vessels it has a close relationship with the Kidneys, and according to the Essential Questions22. "the vessel of the uterus connects with the Kidneys". The role played by the Kidneys in holding the uterine blood in place was emphasised by the great Han dynasty doctor Hua Tuo who said of the Kidneys "In males they serve the purpose of shutting in the essence, while in females, of wrapping the blood"23. Jiāoxìn KID-8 is indicated in a variety of menstrual disorders, and most especially uterine bleeding.

Uterine bleeding may be due to a variety of different aetiologies. If the Kidneys are injured by excessively early sexual activity, sexual overindulgence, multiple pregnancies etc. then either the Kidney yin or Kidney yang may become deficient leading to infirmity of the Conception and Penetrating vessels. Jiāoxìn KID-8 is predominantly indicated in deficiency patterns of uterine bleeding, particularly in cases of Kidney deficiency, but its status as a xi-cleft point and its secondary action of draining damp-heat renders it suitable in the treatment of uterine bleeding due to blood stasis, reckless movement of hot blood and damp-heat.

Jiāoxìn KID-8 has a secondary action of draining damp-heat from the lower jiao. In the genital region it can treat such disorders as itching, swelling, sweating and pain of the genitals. In the urinary system it can promote urination and clear heat in the treatment of retention of urine, difficult urination and painful urinary dysfunction, especially qi painful urinary dysfunction. In the intestines it is indicated in the treatment of diarrhoea, dysenteric disorder and difficult defecation.
