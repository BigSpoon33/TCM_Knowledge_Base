## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Jinmen BL-63 is the xi-cleft point of the Bladder channel. The xi-cleft points, where the qi and blood which flow relatively superficially along the channels from the jingwell points gather and plunge more deeply, are applicable in the treatment of acute conditions and pain. Jinmen BL-63 is indicated for sudden onset of severe shan disorder, sudden turmoil disorder with cramps, epilepsy and white tiger joint pain, a manifestation of painful obstruction characterised by the great severity of the pain which is likened to the bite of a tiger.

Despite its status as the xi-cleft point of the Bladder channel, Jinmen BL-63 (like most of the distal points of the channel) was traditionally ascribed no action on disorders of urination. In this respect, the Bladder channel points are similar to those of the Small and Large Intestine and Sanjiao channels whose points also have little action on their related fu.

Summary of clinical application
Xi-cleft point for sudden onset of: i. severe shan disorder (i.e. hernia, or severe abdominal pain accompanied by constipation and retention of urine, or pain of the external genitalia, testicles or scrotum): ii. sudden turmoil disorder with cramps (i.e. the onset of simultaneous and severe diarrhoea and vomiting with abdominal discomfort and pain); iii. epilepsy, and iv. ‘white tiger’ joint pain - severe painful obstruction which is like the bite of a tiger.
