## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Sanjiaoshu BL-22 is the back-shu point of the Sanjiao, where the qi of the Sanjiao emanates from the interior to the body surface. The Sanjiao integrates and harmonises the upper, middle and lower jiao and dominates the free flow of qi and fluids through these three areas. Located between Weishu BL-21 above and Shenshu BL-23 below, Sanjiaoshu BL-22 however has the action of regulating the qi of the middle and lower jiao only. It integrates the activities of the Stomach and Spleen in the middle jiao, and the Kidneys, Bladder and intestines in the lower jiao, and hence the transformation, transportation and excretion of both food and fluid.

The Classic of Difficulties35 states that ‚Äúthe Sanjiao is the pathway of water and grain‚Äù, the Essential Questions36 says ‚Äúthe Sanjiao is the official in charge of drainage and controls the water passages‚Äù and the Introduction to Medicine says ‚ÄúThe middle jiao dominates transformation of the flavours of water and grain ... therefore it is said the middle jiao is like foam. The lower jiao dominates moving and draining the urine and faeces and at the right time discharging them ... therefore it is said the lower jiao is like a drain‚Äù.

In cases where there is loss of harmony between the Stomach and Spleen in the middle jiao and the intestines in the lower jiao, there are symptoms such as abdominal distention, borborygmus, diarrhoea or dysenteric disorder, undigested food (in the stool), difficult ingestion, oesophageal constriction and vomiting. In severe cases where there is obstruction and accumulation there may be abdominal masses or hypogastric lumps. Sanjiaoshu BL-22 is especially effective to activate and harmonise the qi of the middle and lower jiao, to resolve damp and to dispel stasis, and is one of the most important classically indicated points for such abdominal masses.

In cases where there is loss of harmony between the Spleen in the middle jiao and the Kidneys and Bladder in the lower jiao there may be oedema with difficult urination, blood in the urine and white turbidity due to deficiency and exhaustion. Sanjiaoshu BL-22 is able to treat such disorders by its ability to move the fluids and activate the qi transformation function of the Bladder.

Finally the Sanjiao channel belongs to shaoyang, and although not a point of the Sanjiao channel, Sanjiaoshu BL-22 is indicated for the treatment of alternating chills and fever, heat in the body, bitter taste in the mouth, headache and visual dizziness, all manifestations of shaoyang pattern.
