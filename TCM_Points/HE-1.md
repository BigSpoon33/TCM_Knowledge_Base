## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

J√≠qu√°n HE-1 is the first point of the Heart channel, where the qi emerges from the Heart and its surrounding blood vessels. Located in the centre of the axilla, it is the point of communication between the Heart and chest on the one hand, and the arm on the other, and has an action on both these regions.

In the chest and lateral costal region it promotes the movement of qi and alleviates pain, being indicated for distention and fullness of the lateral costal region, chest pain and shortness of breath. In the Heart itself it treats pain manifesting as Heart painful obstruction and Heart pain with retching.

When the Heart yang declines, with concomitant blood stasis, qi and blood are unable to maintain their circulation through the channels and vessels of the arm, giving rise to numbness, whilst if the warming function of yang is impaired there will be coldness and pain. By promoting circulation of qi and blood throughout the arm, J√≠qu√°n HE-1 is able to treat these disorders.

The axillary region may be viewed as a gateway for the circulation of qi and blood through the arm, implied in the name 'Summit Spring'. In qigong practice and meditation, keeping the axilla slightly open is vital for maintaining the free flow of qi and blood through the upper limb. For this reason it is said that one should stand or sit with enough space in the axilla "to hold an egg". As a result, even in periods of long quiescence the arm and hands will stay warm.

Summary of clinical application
Promotes the movement of qi and alleviates pain in the Heart, chest and lateral costal region: Heart painful obstruction, Heart pain with retching, sadness, anxiety and palpitations, chest pain and shortness of breath, distention and fullness of the lateral costal region.
Regulates the flow of qi through the whole arm: inability to raise the shoulder, pain of the axilla, numbness and painful obstruction of the upper limb, cold and pain of the elbow and arm.
