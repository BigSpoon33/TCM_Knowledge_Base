## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Húnmén BL-47 is level with Gānshū BL-18, the back-shu point of the Liver. The Liver stores the ethereal soul (hun), but despite its striking name (Gate of the Ethereal Soul), psychological and emotional indications for this point are notable by their absence in major classical texts63. Húnmén BL-47 does, however, have some action on regulating the Liver qi and soothing the sinews, and is indicated for fullness and distention of the chest and lateral costal region, contraction of the sinews, and bone and joint pain of the whole body. It is also able to regulate the middle jiao, treating disharmony of both the Spleen (diarrhoea, borborygmus) and Stomach (difficult ingestion, vomiting).

According to the Essential Questions64, the five outer Bladder points level with the five zang back-shu points (i.e. Pòhù BL-42, Shéntáng BL-44, Húnmén BL-47, Yìshè BL-49 and Zhìshì BL-52) drain heat from the five zang, an action shared by the back-shu points of the five zang.
