## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

There are three points anterior to the tragus of the ear, Ěrmén SJ-21 superiorly, Tīnggōng SI-19 in the middle, and Tīnghuì GB-2 inferiorly. All are frequently employed for the treatment of a wide variety of ear disorders, including tinnitus, deafness, pain, itching and discharge. Due to the close proximity of these points and the similar indications for each, it is difficult to distinguish between them clinically. It is worth noting however that Tīnggōng SI-19 has a secondary action of calming the spirit, whilst Tīnghuì GB-2 is the most effective to treat painful disorders of the surrounding area including the jaw and teeth. If it is necessary to needle points around the ear regularly, then these three points should be alternated.

In current practice, where points are numbered, it is easy to remember the relative locations of Ěrmén SJ-21 (Gate of the Ear), Tīnggōng SI-19 (Palace of Hearing) and Tīnghuì GB-2 (Meeting of Hearing), the highest point number being the uppermost point. In China, which has no tradition of numbering the points, one way of recalling the order of their location was by the image of entering through the 'gate' of the 'palace' to convene a 'meeting'.

Summary of clinical application
Much used for all ear disorders including deafness, tinnitus and purulent discharge.
