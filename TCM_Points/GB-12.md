## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

W√°ng«î GB-12 is able to benefit the head region and eliminate both exterior and interior wind. It is indicated for i. headache and head wind, especially when there is pain behind the ear, ii. stiffness and pain of the neck, and iii. heat, pain and swelling affecting the teeth, cheek, ear and throat.

Like many points in the neck region, W√°ng«î GB-12 is also able to regulate disharmony between the head and the body. When interior wind stirs and rushes up to the head there may be hemiplegia, deviation of the mouth and eyes, shaking of the head and clenched jaw. At the same time as pathogenic wind rushes up to the head, there may be deficiency in the lower part of the body manifesting as atrophy disorder and weakness and flaccidity of the four limbs. This latter application reflects the principle expounded in the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic2 "When the disease is below select [points] from above".

Another important action of W√°ng«î GB-12 is to regulate and calm the spirit, and it is indicated in such disorders as mania, agitation of the Heart and insomnia. This is reflected in its close proximity to the extra point ƒÄnmi√°n N-HN-54 'Peaceful Sleep', located just posterior and slightly superior to W√°ng«î GB-12, which is much used for insomnia.

Summary of clinical application
For fullness above: headache (especially when there is pain behind the ear), stiffness and pain of the neck, deviation of the mouth and eyes, shaking of the head, clenched jaw, heat, pain and swelling affecting the teeth, cheek, ear and throat.
For deficiency below: atrophy disorder, weakness and flaccidity of the four limbs.
Calms the spirit: mania, insomnia, agitation of the Heart, epilepsy and mania.
