## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

It is an important principal of the five shu points that the more distal they are (i.e. close to the fingers or toes), the stronger their effect on treating their corresponding channel as a whole, and the opposite end of the channel in particular, whilst the more proximal they are (close to the knee and elbow), the more pronounced their action on the internal fu and the trunk and body portion of the channel. In terms of the Stomach channel Jiěxī ST-41, the jing-river and fire point, lying as it does between the two extremes, has an equally important effect on clearing heat from both the channel and the fu.

The effect of Jiěxī ST-41 on clearing heat from the Stomach channel, especially the upper part, is reflected in its ability to treat pain, swelling and inflammation in the yangming portion of the head, manifesting as frontal headache, redness of the face and eyes, mouth pain etc. Although swelling of the face is usually differentiated as either Spleen yang deficiency, or Lung qi deficiency complicated with invasion of exterior wind, Jiěxī ST-41 is indicated here by virtue of its action of clearing the yangming channel which governs the face.

When heat accumulates in the Stomach fu it may: i. impair the descending function of the Stomach giving rise to abdominal distention and belching, ii. cause excessive hunger due to hyperactivity of yang, or iii. dessicate the fluids in the Stomach and intestines leading to hunger with inability to eat and constipation. Jiěxī ST-41 is indicated in all three patterns.

Stomach fire may ascend along the Stomach divergent channel to the Heart, and along the Stomach primary channel which connects with the Governing vessel (and thus the brain) at Shéntíng DU-24 and Rénzhōng DU-26. The resulting disturbance of the spirit and Heart may give rise to various emotional disorders, especially of the manic kind, and palpitations associated with emotional changes such as fright. Jiěxī ST-41 has a dual ability to clear heat from the Stomach and to calm and sedate the spirit.

Finally, Jiěxī ST-41 is an important and much-used point in disorders of the lower leg. It is frequently combined with Bìguān ST-31 and Zúsānlǐ ST-36 in the 'chain and lock' method for the treatment of atrophy disorder and hemiplegia. It may also be used as a distal point for disorders of the knee joint, and is important in the treatment of local disorders of the foot and ankle. For this purpose it may be directed laterally towards Qiūxū GB-40 for disorders of the middle and lateral portions of the ankle, and towards Shāngqiū SP-5 for disorders of the middle and medial portions of the ankle. Needling to join with Shāngqiū SP-5 is also applied for dual disharmony of the Stomach and Spleen.

Summary of clinical application
Clears heat from the upper reaches of the Stomach channel: swelling of the face and head, frontal headache, eyebrow pain, redness of the face and eyes, dizziness, pain in the mouth.
Clears heat from the Stomach fu: abdominal distention and fullness, belching, hunger with inability to eat, constipation.
Clears Stomach heat transmitting to the Heart: epilepsy, mania, agitation, sadness and weeping, fright palpitations, Stomach heat with raving, ‘sees ghosts’.
Benefits the ankle and lower leg: swelling and pain of the ankle joint, atrophy disorder of the leg, heaviness of the knee and thigh, drop-foot, tendon and damp painful obstruction.
