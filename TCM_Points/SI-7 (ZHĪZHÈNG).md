## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Zhīzhèng SI-7 has three main actions. Firstly, since the Small Intestine belongs to taiyang channel (the most exterior of the six channels and thus the first to be attacked by exterior pathogenic factors) Zhīzhèng SI-7 in common with many points of the Small Intestine channel is able to release the exterior. It is primarily used in cases of exterior heat pathogen giving rise to febrile disease, and is especially indicated when the onset is characterised by neck and lumbar pain.

Secondly, Zhīzhèng SI-7 is the luo-connecting point of the Small Intestine channel from where the Small Intestine luo-connecting channel spreads to join with the Heart channel. This is reflected in the name of this point 'Branch of the Upright', the 'upright' being the Heart channel. The Guide to the Classics of Acupuncture states "the luo-connecting points are located between two channels ... if they are punctured, symptoms of the interiorly-exteriorly related channels can be treated"5. Zhīzhèng SI-7 has a pronounced effect on regulating and calming the spirit and is indicated for mania-depression, fear and fright, and sadness and anxiety. The Methods of Acupuncture and Moxibustion from the Golden Mirror of Medicine more specifically recommends Zhīzhèng SI-7 for depression and knotting of all the seven emotions.

Thirdly Zhīzhèng SI-7 is able to regulate the Small Intestine channel in the region of the head (headache and dizziness), eyes (blurred vision, superficial visual obstruction, visual dizziness), elbow (contraction of the elbow), and especially the fingers (severe pain of all the fingers, inability to grip firmly, inability to make a fist). The principle of selecting distal points to treat disorders of the limbs, trunk and head is fundamental to acupuncture practice, and since the twelve primary channels all flow to or from the hands and feet, there is a profusion of distal points to choose from. In the treatment of disorders of the hands and feet themselves, however, there are by definition no distal points, and there are relatively few proximal points that affect these areas. Zhīzhèng SI-7 is therefore notable for its action on the fingers and hand.

Finally the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion gives specific indications for excess and deficiency of the luo-connecting points. In the case of Zhīzhèng SI-7, these are slackness of the joints and inability to move the elbow (excess); warts (deficiency).
