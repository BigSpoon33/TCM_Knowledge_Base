## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Jiūwéi REN-15 is the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel, from where the qi of this channel disperses and spreads down over the abdomen. The name of Jiūwéi REN-15 (Turtledove Tail) reflects the shape of the xiphoid process, likened to the tail of a dove, with the ribs forming the wings. In fact, historically there has been some discussion as to whether Huìyīn REN-1, rather than Jiūwéi REN-15, is the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel. The Spiritual Pivot 19 refers to the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel as Weiyi (Tail Screen), an alternative name for Jiūwéi REN-15, and gives symptoms of excess (pain of the skin of the abdomen) and deficiency (itching of the skin of the abdomen). Later classics, however, including both the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion refer to the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel as Pingyi (Flat Screen), an alternative name for Huìyīn REN-1, and ascribe these symptoms of excess and deficiency to that point. Huìyīn REN-1 rather than Jiūwéi REN-15 as the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel would reflect a neat symmetry with Chángqiáng DU-1 as the luo-connecting point of the Governing vessel.

Like Jùguè REN-14, the front-mu point of the Heart, Jiūwéi REN-15 has a powerful action on calming the spirit in cases of phlegm obscuring the Heart (epilepsy, mania disorder, mad singing and walking and aversion to the sound of people talking), as well as regulating stagnation of qi and blood in the Heart region giving rise to oppression and pain. Also like Jùguè REN-14, Jiūwéi REN-15 is able to regulate and descend Lung qi in cases of wheezing, cough, dyspnoea etc.

In the Spiritual Pivot 20 Jiūwéi REN-15 is listed as the yuan point of the 'gao'. This term, the same gao as in Gāohuāngshū BL-43, refers to the area below the Heart, whilst 'huang' refers to the area above the diaphragm. It is said that when a disease enters the gaohuang it is difficult to cure. Master Zuo-jiu's Tradition of the Spring and Autumn Annals 21 , one of the earliest textual references to acupuncture, describes how when the Prince of Jin was gravely ill, he sent for the famous Doctor Yi Huan. After examining the patient, Doctor Huan declared that the disease had settled in the gaohuang region (between the Heart and the diaphragm) and hence "it cannot be purged, it cannot be reached [by needling], herbs will not penetrate it, there is nothing to be done". Despite the statement by the Spiritual Pivot which implies that the gao originates at Jiūwéi REN-15, this point is not normally understood to treat deep and chronic deficiency diseases, the only relevant indications being 'diminished qi' and 'excessive sexual activity leading to exhaustion in youths'.

Summary of clinical application

Regulates the Heart and Lung: oppressive sensation in the Heart, chest pain, excessive sighing, pain radiating from the Heart to the back, wheezing, dyspnoea, fullness of the chest, cough, coughing blood, diminished qi, rattling sound in the throat.
