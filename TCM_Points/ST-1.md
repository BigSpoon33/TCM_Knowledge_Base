## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Ch√©ngq√¨ ST-1 is one of the two principal local points of the primary channels for the treatment of eye diseases (the other being Jƒ´ngm√≠ng BL-1), and is the meeting of a network of channels. The Stomach primary channel meets the Bladder channel at Jƒ´ngm√≠ng BL-1 before descending along the infraorbital ridge to Ch√©ngq√¨ ST-1, the Stomach divergent channel connects with the eye, and the Stomach sinew channel joins with the Bladder sinew channel to form a muscular net around the eye.

The aetiology and pathology of eye disorders is complex and varied but may be simplified into i. attack by exterior pathogenic wind-heat or wind-cold, ii. interior disharmony (primarily flaring of Liver fire, uprising of Liver yang or deficiency of Liver yin and blood), or iii. a combination of both interior disharmony and exterior pathogens. Not only is Ch√©ngq√¨ ST-1 able to dispel pathogenic factors such as wind, cold and heat from the eye, but by strongly invigorating and stimulating the qi and blood of the local area it is equally applicable for disorders due to any kind of interior disharmony, and is therefore indicated for the fullest range of eye diseases. This includes the traditional categories of redness, swelling and pain, lacrimation, superficial visual obstruction, dimness of vision, short sightedness, night blindness, itching of the eyes, upward staring eyes, visual dizziness and twitching of the eyelids. In terms of modern disease categories, Ch√©ngq√¨ ST-1 is indicated for acute and chronic conjunctivitis, myopia, glaucoma, astigmatism, colour blindness, neuritis of the optic nerve, keratitis, and blepharospasm.

As the name 'Container of Tears' suggests, Ch√©ngq√¨ ST-1 is especially important in the treatment of excessive lacrimation, which is classically subdivided into cold or hot types, in both cases complicated by exterior wind. The cold type may be due to deficiency and cold of the Liver channel or exhaustion of the Liver and Kidneys, whilst the hot type may be due to Liver channel wind-heat or Liver yin deficiency with heat.

Summary of clinical application
One of the two principal local points of the primary channels (along with Jƒ´ngm√≠ng BL-1‚Äã) for the treatment of all eye diseases: redness, swelling and pain, superficial visual obstruction, dimness of vision, inability to see distant objects, night blindness, itching of the eyes, upward staring eyes, twitching of the eyelids, acute and chronic conjunctivitis, myopia, glaucoma, astigmatism, colour blindness, neuritis of the optic nerve, keratitis, and blepharospasm. Special for lacrimation.
