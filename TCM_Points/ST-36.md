## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Zúsānlǐ ST-36 (Leg Three Miles) is the he-sea and earth point of the Stomach earth channel. It was included by Ma Dan-yang, the great physician of the Jin dynasty, among the 'eleven heavenly star points'20, his grouping of the most vital acupuncture points, and was indicated by him for cold in the Stomach, borborygmus and diarrhoea, swelling of the leg, pain of the knee, emaciation due to injury by cold and all parasitic diseases. The Glorious Anthology of Acupuncture and Moxibustion by the Ming dynasty author Gao Wu includes Zúsānlǐ ST-36 among the 'four command points' (for disorders of the abdomen). Qin Cheng-zu of the Song dynasty declared that by using the point Zúsānlǐ ST-36 "all diseases can be treated".

The term 'li' in the name Zusanli may variously be interpreted as meaning a measure of distance (a Chinese mile) or as a homonym for 'to rectify'. The former interpretation reflects the idea that stimulating Zúsānlǐ ST-36 would enable a person to walk a further three li, even when exhausted, as well as that the point is located three cun below the knee. The latter interpretation reflects the concept that Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is able to rectify either the three vital zangfu (Stomach, Spleen and Kidneys) or the three jiao (upper, middle and lower).

The Classic of Difficulties21recommended the use of the he-sea points for "counterflow qi and diarrhoea", whilst the Spiritual Pivot22 not only recommended their use for diseases of the internal fu, but also stated "in disorders of the Stomach and in disorders resulting from irregular eating and drinking, select the he-sea point". Zúsānlǐ ST-36 may be used in the treatment of any disorder of the Stomach fu, whether due to cold or heat, deficiency or excess, stagnation and retention of food, fluid or blood etc. Under normal conditions the Stomach has the function of receiving food and drink, "rotting and ripening" them, and descending the products of digestion. When these functions are impaired, which can be due to any of the above patterns, two principal disharmonies may appear: i. Stomach qi may fail to descend, leading to stagnation of qi and food and giving rise to epigastric or abdominal fullness, distention and pain, poor appetite etc. or ii. Stomach qi may rebel upwards giving rise to nausea, vomiting, belching, hiccup and difficult ingestion. In the case of Stomach heat there may be excessive hunger, whilst in the case of Stomach yin deficiency there may be hunger without desire to eat. In any one of these possible disorders of the Stomach, Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is indicated.

Zúsānlǐ ST-36, the earth point of the Stomach channel, also has a profound effect on regulating its coupled earth zang, the Spleen, and is able to strengthen the Spleen's function of transforming and transporting both food essence and fluid. As such it is an important point for the treatment of diarrhoea or dysenteric disorder, borborygmus, oedema, inability to urinate and heaviness of the limbs. Its important action on all disorders of the intestines, which are dominated by the Spleen, is reflected in the Spiritual Pivot23 which advises the use of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 "when the intestines do not function correctly; if it is full reduce it, if it is empty reinforce it". It should be emphasised that the ability of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 to transform damp derives from its primary action of tonifying the Spleen. This differentiates Zúsānlǐ ST-36 from a point such as Yīnlíngquán SP-9 where the action of transforming damp is primary.

The Stomach and Spleen in the middle jiao are the root of the post-heaven qi and the prime source for the production of qi and blood and the continual supplementation of the pre-heaven essence. This vital role is emphasised in countless statements found in the ancient classics such as "The Stomach is the root of the zangfu"24, "The five zang and six fu all receive qi from the Stomach"25, "The Stomach is the sea of qi and blood"26, as well as traditional sayings such as "Stomach qi is the root of man". Another saying "With Stomach qi there is life, without Stomach qi there is death" emphasises the vital importance of assessing the state of the Stomach qi (manifested by the patient's appetite and digestion) in prognosis. It is said that even in serious disease, strong Stomach qi is an encouraging prognostic sign, whilst in a less serious disease, exhaustion of Stomach qi is a poor prognostic sign. This principle is reinforced in the Essential Questions27 which says "Water and grain are the root of human life; without water and grain a person will die, as one will die when Stomach qi is absent from the pulse". In the chapter 'Discourse On the Seas' in the Spiritual Pivot28, Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is given as the lower point of the 'sea of water and grain' (Qìchōng ST-30 is the upper point). According to this passage, when the sea of water and grain is in excess, there is abdominal fullness, and when it is deficient there is hunger with inability to eat.

Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is the single most important point in the body to stimulate the action of the Stomach and Spleen in generating qi and blood. The post-heaven qi derives from the interaction of the grain qi (extracted from food and drink by the Spleen and Stomach) and the clear qi of air (transformed by the Lung), with the assistance of the original qi. Zúsānlǐ ST-36 alone is an important point to tonify the qi of the whole body, or in combination with Tàiyuān LU-9 (the earth point of the Lung metal channel) to tonify the Lung qi according to the principle of 'cultivating the earth to generate metal'. It is indicated for insufficiency of original qi, deficient dyspnoea, dyspnoea with inability to stand for long, coughing and shortness of breath. By virtue of its action of tonifying qi, Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is also able to nourish the blood and is indicated for palpitations, dimness of vision, dizziness and post-partum blood dizziness.

Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is also renowned for its ability to support the correct qi. This is expressed in the recommendation by Sun Si-miao to apply regular moxibustion to Zúsānlǐ ST-36 to preserve and maintain health, and in the ancient proverb (quoted for example by the 13th century doctor Wang Zhi-zhong) "if you wish to be safe never allow Sanli (ST-36) to become dry", referring to the prophylactic use of moxibustion. This saying implies that a constant suppurating sore should be maintained at Zúsānlǐ ST-36 through the repeated use of burning moxibustion. The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion also emphasises the profound tonifying effect of this point by stating "frequently moxa Zúsānlǐ ST-36 and Qìhǎi REN-6 in young people whose qi is feeble" whilst Ma Dan-yang advocates regular needling and moxibustion at Zúsānlǐ ST-36 for those who have passed the age of thirty. It is sometimes suggested that Zúsānlǐ ST-36 should not be needled in case of attack by exterior pathogens, since its effect of reinforcing the correct qi may also reinforce the pathogen. In this respect, however, it is interesting to note that Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is classically indicated for chills and fever, febrile disease with absence of sweating, and febrile disease with heavy head and pain of the forehead.

The great Han dynasty physician Hua Tuo is said to have valued the use of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 to treat the five taxations and the seven injuries. The five taxations as discussed in the Spiritual Pivot29 are i. excessive use of the eyes which injures the blood, ii. excessive lying down which injures the qi, iii. excessive sitting which injures the flesh, iv. excessive standing which injures the bones, and v. excessive walking which injures the sinews. In later texts, the concept of the five taxations was also used to refer to taxation of each of the five zang30. Although also referring to a range of male genital disorders (see glossary), the seven injuries in this context are i. overeating which injures the Spleen, ii. great anger which injures the Liver, iii. heavy lifting or prolonged sitting on damp ground which injure the Kidneys, iv. pathogenic cold which injures the Lung, v. worry and anxiety which injure the Heart, vi. wind, rain, cold and summer-heat which injure the body, and vii. excessive fear which injures the emotions.

Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is also indicated classically for insufficiency of both original qi and yin. Original qi originates in the Kidneys but is dependent on the post-heaven qi of the Stomach and Spleen. The Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach by Li Dong-yuan says "Sufficiency of original qi is dependent on the qi of the Spleen and Stomach being free of injury; only then can the original qi be supplemented and nourished". As far as deficiency of yin is concerned, according to Secrets of a Frontier Official "When a person passes the age of thirty, if moxa is not applied to Zúsānlǐ ST-36 then the qi will rise and rush to the eyes". This statement emphasises that Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is also able to supplement the inevitable decline of Kidney yin that occurs with advancing age, and thus prevent pathologically ascending yang from rushing to the head and eyes.

The Stomach divergent channel connects with the Heart, whilst the Stomach primary channel meets with the Governing vessel (and thus the brain) at Shéntíng DU-24 and Rénzhōng DU-26. If yangming fire blazes out of control it may be transmitted along these channels to the Heart and brain and agitate the spirit. Heart fire may be complicated by phlegm, which usually derives from prolonged dampness or from condensation of body fluids by fire. Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is able to clear yangming fire and, due to its influence on the Spleen, to resolve dampness and transform phlegm. This renders it effective in treating a wide variety of mental disturbances, especially those characterised by manic behaviour, for example mania-depression, manic singing, raving, abusive talk, anger and fright and outrageous laughter. One alternative name for Zúsānlǐ ST-36 given in the Illustrated Supplement to the Classic of Categories is Guixie (Ghost Evil), underlining its ability to treat mental disorders. In addition, since blood is the material basis for the Heart to house the spirit, the blood enhancing property of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 also renders it effective to treat emotional disorders arising from Heart blood deficiency. More widely, due to the pathway of the Stomach channel in the upper body, Zúsānlǐ ST-36, like Fēnglóng ST-40, is indicated for pain of the Heart and chest, especially when due to blood stasis.

Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is an important point to treat disorders of the Stomach channel, including swelling, pain and abscess of the breast as well as pain of the thigh and shin. The fact that yangming channel is abundant in qi and blood, allied with the inherent nourishing quality of this point, renders Zúsānlǐ ST-36 a vital point in the treatment of disorders of the lower limb as a whole, especially atrophy disorder and hemiplegia. This is emphasised in the Essential Questions which states "When there is illness in the Spleen it fails to transport body fluids for the Stomach. The four limbs do not receive the nourishment of water and grain and therefore become weak. There is no free flow through the vessel-pathways and there is no qi to engender the sinews, bones and muscles which therefore cannot function"31. Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is no less important in the treatment of painful obstruction due to cold and dampness, especially when chronic in nature. The Spiritual Pivot32says "for damp painful obstruction that is not expelled, for chronic cold that does not cease, choose Zúsānlǐ ST-36". In the treatment of atrophy disorder and painful obstruction, Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is frequently combined in the chain and lock method with other points of the Stomach yangming channel such as Bìguān ST-31 and Jiěxī ST-41.

Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is cited in the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc. The Essential Questions33 includes Zúsānlǐ ST-36 among the eight points to clear heat from the Stomach (bilateral Qìchōng ST-30, Zúsānlǐ ST-36, Shàngjùxū ST-37 and Xiàjùxū ST-39).

In conclusion, such is the range of actions and indications of this singular point, that it barely seems an exaggeration to state, as did Qin Cheng-zu nearly a thousand years ago, that by the use of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 "all diseases can be treated".
