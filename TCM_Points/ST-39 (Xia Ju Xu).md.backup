## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic stated "The Large and Small intestines fall under the influence of the Stomach"37 and classified Xiàjùxū ST-39 as the lower he-sea point of the Small Intestine. The three yang channels of the arm (Large Intestine, Small Intestine and Sanjiao) are unique in that whilst the channels traverse the upper jiao, their respective fu belong to the lower jiao. Thus although the Spiritual Pivot states that the "He-sea points treat disorders of the internal fu", the he-sea points of these three channels (Qūchí L.I.-11, Xiǎohǎi SI-8, and Tiānjǐng SJ-10 respectively) have relatively little action on their related fu. The Large and Small Intestines and the Sanjiao, however, each have a lower he-sea point (Shàngjùxū ST-37, Xiàjùxū ST-39 and Wěiyáng BL-39) which predominantly treat disorders of their respective fu.

Xiàjùxū ST-39 may be used in two principal patterns of the Small Intestine, namely Small Intestine qi pain and Small Intestine deficient and cold. The former is characterised by severe pain of the lower abdomen which radiates to the waist and lumbar region and down to the testicles. The latter is characterised by (dull) lower abdominal pain (which is improved with warmth and pressure) and chronic diarrhoea or dysenteric disorder etc. Xiàjùxū ST-39 is further able to treat diarrhoea and dysenteric disorder due to damp heat which give rise to pus and blood in the stool.

The Essential Questions38 includes Xiàjùxū ST-39 among the eight points to clear heat from the Stomach, emphasising that as well as being the he-sea point of the Small Intestine, this point lies on the Stomach channel and is indicated for heat in the channel giving rise to disorders such as breast abscess, dry lips and throat painful obstruction. Unusually, Xiàjùxū ST-39 is also clearly ascribed some ability to regulate the Small Intestine channel, reflected in such indications as extreme sensation of cold and heat in the shoulder, heat sensation in the area between the ring and little fingers, and burning sensation in front of the ears.

For a discussion of Xiàjùxū ST-39 as a point of the 'sea of blood' refer to the commentary on Shàngjùxū ST-37.

Finally, Xiàjùxū ST-39 belongs to yangming channel which is abundant in qi and blood, and is similar to points such as Zúsānlǐ ST-36 and Shàngjùxū ST-37 in its ability to treat disorders of the lower limb. It is indicated for painful obstruction and atrophy disorder of the lower limb and foot, hemiplegia and heel pain.

Summary of clinical application
For Small Intestine qi pain and Small Intestine deficiency cold: lower abdominal pain, lumbar pain that radiates to the testicles, diarrhoea, dysenteric disorder, pus and blood in the stool, insufficiency of Small Intestine qi.
For painful obstruction, atrophy disorder, hemiplegia of the lower leg, atrophy disorder of the foot, heel pain.
