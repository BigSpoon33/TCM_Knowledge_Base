## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The name of Tóuqiàoyīn GB-11 (Yin Portals of the Head) is said to refer to its ability to treat diseases of the sense organs associated with the five zang, namely the eyes (Liver), ears (Kidneys), tongue (Heart), mouth (Spleen) and nose (Lung). In fact, classical indications appear for all of these except the nose. In this respect, Tóuqiàoyīn GB-11 in the upper body mirrors Zúqiàoyīn GB-44 (Yin Portals of the Foot) in the lower body. For further discussion of Tóuqiàoyīn GB-11 see Fúbái GB-10.
