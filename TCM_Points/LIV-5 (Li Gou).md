## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the Spiritual Pivot13 “The Liver governs the sinews”, whilst the Essential Questions14 says “The genitals are the gathering place of the sinews”. The Liver primary channel encircles the genitals, and the Liver sinew channel and the Liver luo-connecting channel from Ligou LIV-5 ascend to the genitals.

Ligou LIV-5, the luo-connecting point of the Liver channel, is a major point for treating diseases of this area and is indicated for itching, swelling and pain of the genitals and sudden pain and swelling of the testicles due to both Liver qi stagnation and damp-heat in the Liver channel. Ligou LIV-5 is also indicated for incessant erection (priapism). The Liver belongs to wood and spring, which manifest the energy of growth, spreading and ascending, and is entrusted with ministerial (ming men) fire which has its source in the Kidneys. Normal erection is dependent both on the flourishing of the Kidneys and harmony of the Liver. Incessant erection may arise either in the springtime of adolescence, when the Kidney essence becomes abundant and the Liver is exuberant, in which case it may be embarrassing but is not considered abnormal, or when pathological flaring of Liver fire agitates and inflames the penis, in which case it is a pathological and distressing condition. Ligou LIV-5 is one of the few points especially indicated for this disorder.

The ability of Ligou LIV-5 to clear Liver qi stagnation and damp-heat extends to the lower jiao as a whole, and it is indicated for red and white leucorrhoea, shan disorder, distention of the lower abdomen, qi accumulation below the umbilicus like a stone, prolapse of the uterus, difficult urination and retention of urine.

In common with many of the luo-connecting points, especially of the yin channels, Ligou LIV-5 treats a variety of psycho-emotional disorders. The Liver channel ascends to the throat and according to a number of classics, including the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Ligou LIV-5 is indicated for “ ... worry and oppression, stuffiness in the throat as if [obstructed by] a polyp”. This refers to what is more commonly known in Chinese medicine as plumstone qi (globus hystericus), a sensation of physical obstruction that fluctuates according to a person’s mood. Plumstone qi is most commonly due to stagnation of Liver qi and accumulation of phlegm. Ligou LIV-5 is further indicated for depression, fright palpitations and fear and fright, these latter indications reflecting the statement in the Spiritual Pivot15 “when Liver qi is deficient there is fear”.

The Liver stores the blood, and the smooth flow of blood depends on the free-flowing of Liver qi. The Liver therefore has a close relationship to the menstrual cycle and Ligou LIV-5 is able to treat menstrual disorders such as dysmenorrhoea and irregular menstruation due to qi stagnation or blood stasis. Due to its ability to treat depression, it is especially indicated when this symptom accompanies menstrual disorders.

The Liver has the functions of both spreading the qi and nourishing the sinews. It is interesting to note that in common with several other points of the Liver channel, Ligou LIV-5 is indicated for inflexibility and pain of the lumbar region, reflecting the clinical importance of Liver pathology (see Xingjian LIV-2) in some disorders of this area.

Finally the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion gives specific indications for excess and deficiency of the luo-connecting points. In the case of Ligou LIV-5, these are persistent erection (excess); sudden itching of the genitals (deficiency).
