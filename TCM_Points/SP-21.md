## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The name of the point Dàbāo SP-21 is made up of two characters, 'Da' meaning great, and 'Bao' meaning 'to wrap', or 'to envelop'. According to the Spiritual Pivot21 "The great luo of the Spleen is known as Dabao; it emerges at three cun below the axilla spreading in the chest and lateral costal region. When it is excess there is pain of the whole body. When it is deficient the hundred joints are flaccid. This channel embraces the blood of all the luo [connecting channels]".

A possible explanation of this passage from the Spiritual Pivot is that one of the functions of the luo-connecting channels in general is to assist in the distribution of qi, and more especially blood, to all the tissues of the body via the network of the minute luo-connecting channels. Since the Spleen controls blood, its great luo-connecting channel dominates this function of blood distribution throughout the body. When blood stagnates "there is pain of the whole body"; when blood is deficient and unable to nourish the tissues "the hundred joints are flaccid".

Dàbāo SP-21 is also mentioned in the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries which says that it dominates the upper region (Tiānshū ST-25 dominates the middle region and Dìjī SP-8 dominates the lower region). Despite these two classical references, Dàbāo SP-21 appears in no traditional combinations in any of the major classical texts.

Summary of clinical application
The great-luo connecting point of the Spleen which is said to embrace the blood of all the luo-connecting channels: pain of the whole body, weariness of the four limbs, flaccidity of the limbs, flaccidity of the hundred joints.
