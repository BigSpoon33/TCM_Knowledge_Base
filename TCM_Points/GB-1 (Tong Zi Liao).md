## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The Gall Bladder, Gall Bladder divergent and Liver channels connect with the eye, and the Liver zang (interiorly-exteriorly related to the Gall Bladder) opens into the eyes. Tóngzǐliáo GB-1, the first point of the channel and located just lateral to the eye, is used to treat all kinds of eye disorders, especially when due to Liver channel wind-heat. Whilst eye disorders may be due to exterior wind-heat or interior Liver fire, in clinical practice these two patterns are commonly mixed, and a person who suffers from interior Liver fire or Liver yang is prone to attacks of exterior wind or wind-heat. This commonly-seen clinical situation is often referred to as Liver channel wind-heat.

Tóngzǐliáo GB-1 is traditionally indicated for pain, swelling, redness and itching of the eyes, lacrimation and disorders of vision, and in modern times for such disorders as glaucoma, photophobia, cataract, nebula, corneal opacity, keratitis, retinal haemorrhage and atrophy of the optic nerve. It is also commonly used for temporal headache and supraorbital pain, especially due to the above aetiologies, as well as for deviation of the mouth and eye due to exterior or interior wind. Interestingly Tóngzǐliáo GB-1 is included with Shàozé SI-1 in a classical prescription for breast pain in women. This reflects the pathway of the Gall Bladder sinew channel to the breast.

Summary of clinical application
Treats eye disorders especially due to Liver channel wind-heat (a combination of interior Liver fire or Liver yang and attack of exterior wind or wind-heat): pain, swelling, redness and itching of the eyes, lacrimation, disorders of vision (and glaucoma, photophobia, retinal haemorrhage, atrophy of the optic nerve).
For temporal headache and supraorbital pain.
