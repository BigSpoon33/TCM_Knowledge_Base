## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the Classic of Difficulties19 jing-river points are indicated for "cough and dyspnoea, chills and fever". Jīngqú LU-8, the jing-river point of the Lung channel, is primarily indicated for excess type cough, dyspnoea and wheezing with fullness and pain of the chest and upper back, and for febrile disease with absence of sweating.

An unusual indication for Jīngqú LU-8 found in the Classic of Supplementing Life with Acupuncture and Moxibustion is pain in the region of Yǒngquán KID-1. Pain in the sole is usually due either to deficiency of the Kidneys or to phlegm and dampness pouring downwards.

It should be emphasised, however, that in modern clinical practice Jīngqú LU-8 is infrequently used.

As the jing-well point of the Lung channel, primarily indicated for excess type cough, dyspnoea, wheezing, distention and pain of the chest and upper back, and febrile disease with absence of sweating.
