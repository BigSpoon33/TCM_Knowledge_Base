## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Unusually for a point located above the umbilicus, Shíguān KID-18 is indicated for a variety of gynaecological disorders including infertility, and especially for severe pain of the abdomen or lateral costal region following childbirth. The indication 'malign blood in the uterus' refers to blood which has left the vessels and which pools and stagnates. All these indications reflect the status of Shíguān KID-18 as a meeting point of the Kidney channel with the Penetrating vessel which originates in the uterus (and is known as the 'sea of blood') and point to a pattern of blood stasis throughout the uterus, the abdomen as a whole and the lateral costal region.
