## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Touwei ST-8 is an important point to treat headaches. Located at the corner of the forehead, it is a meeting point of the Stomach channel with the Gall Bladder channel and the Yang Linking vessel. This meeting of three channels which have such influence on the head is reflected in the name of this point ‚ÄòHead‚Äôs Binding‚Äô. The Stomach channel belongs to yangming which rules the forehead, the Gall Bladder channel belongs to shaoyang which rules the temporal region, whilst the Yang Linking vessel links all the yang channels of the body including the Governing vessel and the Bladder channel which rule the vertex. Whilst the forte of Touwei ST-8 is the treatment of frontal headaches, with different needle direction it may also be used for temporal and vertex headaches.

Touwei ST-8 is particularly indicated in headaches and eye disorders due to wind, whether exterior pathogenic wind invading the channels of the head, or internally generated wind. As far as exterior headaches are concerned, although it is suitable for both wind-cold and wind-heat, many classics stress its use in the treatment of splitting headaches with bursting eye pain, symptoms more usually associated with wind-heat. Heat is a yang pathogen and its nature is to flare upwards and expand, obstructing the collaterals and leading to a distending and splitting sensation of the head. In the treatment of headache accompanied by pain or twitching of the eyes, Touwei ST‚Äë8 is frequently combined in classical prescriptions with Zanzhu BL-2. Touwei ST-8 is also indicated for severe headache accompanied by vomiting, and is especially suitable for migraine headache with nausea or vomiting and dimness of vision or bursting pain of the eyes. The ability of Touwei ST-8 to clear internally generated wind from the head is reflected not only in its use for this kind of headache, but also for dizziness and hemiplegia.

Summary of clinical application
An important point for headache (meeting point of the Stomach and Gall Bladder channels and the Yang Linking vessel). Especially (needled anteriorly) for frontal and wind-heat headaches and migraines (with splitting sensation, bursting eye pain, dimness of vision, vomiting), but also (with different needling direction) for vertex and temporal headaches and headaches of any aetiology.
