## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Língdào HE-4, as its name 'Spirit Path' implies, has the ability to calm the spirit and is indicated for restless zang disorder and sadness and fear. Restless zang disorder is said to arise due to overthinking, excessive worry and anxiety which injure the Heart, Spleen and Liver. It is characterised by a wide variety of symptoms including unpredictable emotional responses, melancholy, disturbed behaviour, restlessness, insomnia, loss of voice and even mania. In terms of modern medicine it corresponds to hysterical neurosis. The ability ofLíngdào HE-4 to treat sudden loss of voice (note combinations below) reflects its status as a jing-river point, since the Spiritual Pivot5 states that the jing-river points should be needled for changes manifesting in the patient's voice.

According to the Spiritual Pivot6 "when the disease is at the yin within yang (sinews and bones), needle the jing-river point of the yin". Língdào HE-4, the jing-river point of the Heart channel, is indicated for contraction of the elbow and arm and a freezing cold sensation deep within the marrow and bones.

Summary of clinical application
Sadness, fear, restless zang disorder (a pattern where overthinking, excessive worry and anxiety injure the Heart, Spleen and Liver giving rise to various symptoms including unpredictable emotional responses, melancholy, disturbed behaviour, restlessness, insomnia, loss of voice and even mania).
For contraction of the elbow and arm and a freezing cold sensation deep within the marrow and bones.
