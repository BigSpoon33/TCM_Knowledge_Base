## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Jīnggǔ BL-64 is the yuan-source point of the Bladder channel, and like most of the distal Bladder channel points treats fullness of the head. This fullness may be due to attack of exterior pathogenic wind or wind-heat, to stirring of interior wind, to upsurging of yang due to Kidney deficiency, or simply to disharmony of the upper and lower parts of the body. Excess above manifests as heat, pain and heaviness of the head, splitting headache, shaking of the head, rhinitis with ceaseless nosebleed etc., whilst deficiency below gives rise to cold feet.

The Bladder channel ascends to the inner canthus and Jīnggǔ BL-64 is indicated for various eye disorders such as visual dizziness, redness of the inner canthus and superficial visual obstruction.

The Bladder primary channel enters the brain whilst the Bladder divergent channel enters the Heart, and like several distal Bladder channel points, Jīnggǔ BL-64 is indicated for disorders such as palpitations, Heart pain, epilepsy and mania-depression.

Finally, Jīnggǔ BL-64 is indicated for stiffness, pain and contraction along the course of the Bladder channel from the neck to the feet.
