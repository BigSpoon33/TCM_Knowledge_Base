## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

P√≤h√π BL-42 is located on the outer portion of the Bladder channel on the back at the level of F√®ish≈´ BL-13, the back-shu point of the Lung. The name of this point (Door of the Corporeal Soul) suggests that it is effective in treating disorders of the corporeal soul (po) and emotional disorders related to Lung disharmony. In fact, with the exception of 'three corpse possession disorder', the classical indications of this point predominantly reflect its use in nourishing and tonifying the Lung. 'Three corpse possession disorder' is a Daoist concept that refers to some form of 'possession' and is divided into 'upper corpse' which attacks the eyes, 'middle corpse' which attacks the five zang, and 'lower corpse' which attacks human life itself.

The predominant clinical picture expressed by the classical indications for this point is one of severe exhaustion of the Lung. It is indicated for Lung atrophy, Lung consumption, deficiency-taxation, taxation cough with heat in the body etc. In its ability to strengthen the Lung at the deepest level it is similar to GƒÅohuƒÅngsh≈´ BL-43, although less renowned.

According to the Essential Questions60 the five outer Bladder points level with the five zang back-shu points (i.e. P√≤h√π BL-42, Sh√©nt√°ng BL-44, H√∫nm√©n BL-47, Y√¨sh√® BL-49 and Zh√¨sh√¨ BL-52) drain heat from the five zang, an action shared by the back-shu points of the five zang.

Summary of clinical application
Classically indicated for severe exhaustion of the Lung: Lung atrophy (a chronic deficiency disorder where the lungs are said to wither and shrivel, in the same way that the limbs are seen to wither in atrophy syndrome), Lung consumption (a chronic disease characterised by progressive emaciation, cough with blood-streaked sputum, low grade tidal fever, night sweats, lethargy etc.), deficiency-taxation (a general term that is used to describe a variety disorders associated with injury to and depletion of qi, blood and the zangfu), taxation cough with heat in the body. Not commonly used in modern clinical practice).
