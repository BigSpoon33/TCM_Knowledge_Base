## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Shānzhōng REN-17 is also known as Shangqihai (Upper Sea of Qi) and Danzhong (another name for the Pericardium). These alternative names reflect the status of Shānzhōng REN-17 as both the hui-meeting point of qi and the front-mu point of the Pericardium.
The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body.

According to the Spiritual Pivot 22 Shānzhōng REN-17 is the 'sea of qi' (linking with Dàzhuī DU-14, Yǎmén DU-15 and Rényíng ST-9). This passage states "When the sea of qi is in excess there is fullness in the chest, urgent breathing and a red complexion. When the sea of qi is deficient, there is scanty energy insufficient for speech". These indications reflect the ability of Shānzhōng REN-17 to regulate qi in the chest, as well as to treat breathlessness with inability to speak.

The Spiritual Pivot 23 says that the gathering qi accumulates in the 'upper sea', with its lower pathway flowing down to Qìchōng ST-30 and its upper pathway entering the respiratory passages. Located in the centre of the chest, Shānzhōng REN-17 has a strong effect on the gathering qi which in turn oversees both the Lung functions of dominating qi and controlling respiration and speech, and the Heart function of governing the blood and blood vessels. According to the Illustrated Supplement to The Classic of Categories 24 Shānzhōng REN-17 can treat "all types of uprising qi and dyspnoea". When the Lung fails to descend qi and control respiration, whether due to attack by exterior pathogens or to interior disharmony, there will be various manifestations of accumulation or rebellion of qi such as cough, dyspnoea, wheezing, asthma and fullness and oppression of the chest. Shānzhōng REN-17 is an important local point to relieve such accumulation of qi in the chest and to descend rebellion of Lung qi. When the gathering qi is deficient, then both Lung and Heart qi will be deficient. In the Lung there will be shortness of breath, whilst if the Heart qi fails to move the blood and the blood vessels in the chest, there will be chest painful obstruction and pain of the Heart and chest with fullness and oppression. Shānzhōng REN-17 is one of the primary points to regulate the gathering qi.

The action of Shānzhōng REN-17 on descending rebellion of qi extends to the middle jiao, and it is able to restore harmony to the Stomach in cases of difficult ingestion, acid regurgitation, oesophageal constriction and vomiting.

Located midway between the breasts, Shānzhōng REN-17 is a principal point in the treatment of insufficient lactation. According to Observations of Women by Zhang Jing-yue "Qi and blood in the Conception and Penetrating vessels in women transforms into menstrual blood when it descends, and into milk when it ascends; delayed or insufficient production of milk after delivery is due to deficiency of qi and blood", whilst the book Literati's Care of Parents states "Sobbing, crying, grief, anger or depression lead to obstruction of the milk passage". These two quotations illustrate the two main patterns underlying insufficient lactation, namely i. deficiency of qi, and ii. blood and qi stagnation. In either case, Shānzhōng REN-17 may be used in combination with other suitable points, and is frequently found in combination with Shàozé SI-1 in classical combinations. Similarly, Shānzhōng REN-17 is often used clinically in the treatment of distention and pain of the breast and breast abscess. Where any of these breast disorders is unilateral, the needle at Shānzhōng REN-17 may be directed towards the affected side to induce qi sensation into the breast, whilst if the disorder is bilateral, the needle may be directed first to one side and then to the other.

Summary of clinical application
Descends Lung qi, unbinds the chest and regulates the gathering (zong) qi: shortness of breath with rebellious qi, inability to speak, dyspnoea, wheezing, rattling sound in the throat, cough, asthma, fullness and oppression of the chest and diaphragm, obstruction of the chest, pain of the chest and Heart, chest painful obstruction.
For rebellion of Stomach qi: difficult ingestion, acid regurgitation, oesophageal constriction and vomiting.
Important local point for breast disorders: insufficient lactation, breast abscess, distention and pain of the breast.
