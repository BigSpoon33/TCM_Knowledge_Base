## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

D√†zh≈çng KID-4, the luo-connecting point of the Kidney channel, regulates the Kidney function in two main ways. Firstly it reinforces and regulates the relationship between the Kidneys and the Lung, and secondly it has a strong effect on stabilising the emotions.

According to the Complete Works of Jing-yue "The Lung is the master of qi, the Kidneys are the root of qi. The Lung dominates exhalation of qi, whilst the Kidneys dominate the reception of qi. Only when yin and yang are mutually communicating is respiration in harmony". In discussing dyspnoea, the Case Histories from the Guide to Clinical Patterns by Ye Tian-shi states "When it is in the Lung it is excess, when in the Kidneys it is deficient". This latter statement, although something of an over-simplification, nevertheless emphasises that when a respiratory disorder is acute and of excess type, it is the Lung that must be emphasised in treatment, and when it is chronic and deficient in nature, treatment of the Kidneys takes priority. In its action on harmonising the relationship between the Lung and the Kidneys, D√†zh≈çng KID-4 is indicated either when the Kidney qi is insufficient to receive and anchor the qi from the Lung resulting in coughing, wheezing, asthma, shortness of breath etc., or when Kidney yin is deficient and unable to moisten and cool the Lung, mouth and throat, resulting in wheezing, coughing of blood, dry and painful throat etc. Both these situations are referred to as "excess above and deficiency below". Compared to T√†ixƒ´ KID-3, D√†zh≈çng KID-4 has a relatively stronger effect on addressing the fullness above, and a lesser action on nourishing the Kidneys.

In common with many of the luo-connecting points D√†zh≈çng KID-4 has a strong action on the emotions. According to the Spiritual Pivot "Deficiency of qi in the Kidney Channel of foot shaoyin may give rise to susceptibility to fear." When the Kidney qi is not animated, the will is deficient and a person easily suffers from fear and lack of confidence, which may be so severe that they withdraw and are unwilling or unable to leave the safety of their home. When congenital essence is deficient, or essence is consumed in old age, there may be a susceptibility to fearfulness, poor mental function or development, and a decline of mental faculties. Susceptibility to fear may not only be due to deficiency of the Kidneys, especially Kidney essence, but also to feebleness and deficiency of qi and blood which fail to nourish and support the spirit, or to deficiency of the Liver and Gall Bladder. D√†zh≈çng KID-4, an essential point in the treatment of fear due to Kidney deficiency, also plays an important role in the treatment of any of these patterns because of the close relationship of the Kidneys to fear.

Severe excessive desire to sleep may result either from Spleen deficiency with accumulation of phlegm and dampness, or from Kidney yang or Kidney essence deficiency. D√†zh≈çng KID-4 is an important point for somnolence due to Kidney deficiency.

The Kidney luo-connecting channel rises from D√†zh≈çng KID-4 to the lumbar spine, accentuating the close relationship of the Kidneys to this region, and this point is therefore indicated for stiffness and pain of the lumbar region. Like T√†ixƒ´ KID-3, D√†zh≈çng KID-4 is also used for heel pain.

Finally the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion gives specific indications for excess and deficiency of the luo-connecting points. In the case of D√†zh≈çng KID-4, these are retention of urine (excess); lumbar pain (deficiency).
