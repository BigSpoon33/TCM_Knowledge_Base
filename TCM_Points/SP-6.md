## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 (Three Yin Intersection) is the meeting point of the three yin channels of the leg (Spleen, Liver and Kidney) and is one of the most important and widely used of the acupuncture points. Its actions and indications are extraordinarily broad, and it is a primary point in the treatment of many digestive, gynaecological, sexual, urinary and emotional disorders.

Located on the Spleen channel, its strongest action is on harmonising all the functions of the Spleen. The Spleen dominates transportation and transformation and is thus the primary zang responsible for the formation of qi and blood. When Spleen qi or yang is deficient there may be: i. impairment of the transportation and transformation function (undigested food in the stool, diarrhoea, abdominal distention and fullness, borborygmus etc.), ii. inadequate formation of blood (palpitations, blurred vision, amenorrhoea, post-partum dizziness, dizziness associated with uterine bleeding etc.), iii. failure of the Spleen to hold the blood (uterine bleeding, menorrhagia), and iv. sinking of central qi (uterine prolapse). Furthermore, deficiency of Spleen qi and incomplete transportation and transformation may lead to the formation of excess dampness. According to the Essential Questions11 "The lower is the first to suffer from dampness". Dampness, whether damp-heat or cold damp, may lead to heaviness of the body and limbs and oedema, or pour down to the lower jiao giving rise to such symptoms as diarrhoea or leucorrhoea. Sānyīnjiāo SP-6, exceptionally balanced in its action, is unique among points of the Spleen channel in being able to treat all these different manifestations of Spleen disharmony.

Although its primary action is on the Spleen, Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is also an important point to treat disorders of the Liver and Kidneys. It is able to soften and harmonise the Liver, by both spreading the Liver qi and nourishing Liver blood, and at the same time to benefit the Kidney qi. This threefold action of harmonising the Spleen, Liver and Kidneys finds expression in the forte of Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 in treating all disorders of the lower jiao.

The three leg yin channels dominate menstruation, conception, pregnancy, leucorrhoea and the external genitalia. Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is the single most important distal point in the treatment of any gynaecological, obstetrical or post-partum disorder whether characterised by deficiency of qi, blood, yin, yang or Kidney essence, failure of Spleen qi to hold the blood, or stagnation of qi, blood, dampness, damp-heat or phlegm. So wide is its range of action, and so universal its indications, that Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 appears in classical combinations for the treatment of virtually any disorder of the reproductive system. Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is also an essential point to induce labour, assist in transverse presentation and alleviate the pain of childbirth. Despite its indication for restless foetus syndrome, however, its ability to expedite delivery of the live or dead foetus, and the lochia, means that Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is generally contraindicated in pregnancy.

According to the Essential Questions12 "The genitals are the gathering place of the sinews". The Spleen sinew channel binds at the genitals and Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is an essential point in the treatment of sexual and genital disorders in both men and women, including pain and contraction, seminal emission, impotence, and excessive sexual drive in men. Although impotence is generally related to deficiency of Kidney fire, two classics help to explain its relationship to the Spleen. The Complete Works of Jing-yue says "Ming men [the fire of the gate of life stored in the Kidneys] is the sea of the essence and blood, the Spleen is the sea of water and grain; the two together form the foundation of the five zang and six fu", whilst the Essential Questions13 explains "The Kidneys dominate water; they receive essence from the five zang and six fu and store it, therefore only when the five zang are flourishing is ejaculation possible".

Disharmony of the Liver, Spleen or Kidneys is responsible for the majority of urinary disorders, and the principal patterns are accumulation of damp-heat or cold damp, Kidney deficiency, qi deficiency, stagnation of Liver qi or Liver fire. Due to its ability to treat all these pathologies, Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is an essential point for the treatment of urinary disorders, including difficult urination, retention of urine, enuresis, painful urinary dysfunction and cloudy urine.

The actions of Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 are not, however, confined to the middle and lower jiao. Its inclusion in many prescriptions for the treatment of any kind of insomnia (usually in combination with Shénmén HE-7) dramatically illustrates its wide-ranging actions. Insomnia is normally differentiated into five main patterns: i. deficiency of Heart and Spleen (qi and blood deficiency), ii. disharmony of Heart and Kidneys (yin deficiency), iii. disharmony of Heart and Liver (Liver blood and yin deficiency or Liver fire), iv. deficiency of Heart and Gall Bladder (qi deficiency), v. disharmony of Heart and Stomach (accumulation of food or retention of phlegm-heat). Since Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is able to fortify the Spleen, tonify qi and blood, nourish Liver and Kidney yin, spread the Liver qi and harmonise the digestion it may be used in any of these patterns.

The especial importance of treating the Spleen in cases of disharmony of the Heart and Kidneys is emphasised in a number of classics. The Standards of Patterns and Treatments says "In order to tonify the Kidneys it is best to tonify the Spleen; use the Spleen to connect with the Heart in the upper and with the Kidneys in the lower ..." and "The essence of the five zang is all transported from the Spleen; when the Spleen is flourishing then the Heart and Kidneys are in communication". The Helpful Questions in Medical Cases says "If you desire to establish communication between the Heart and the Kidneys it is necessary to use the Spleen earth as an intermediary".

Along with Géshū BL-17, Xuèhǎi SP-10 and Dìjī SP-8, Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is considered one of the most important acupuncture points to harmonise and cool blood and to promote and invigorate its circulation. This action finds its most important application in the treatment of gynaecological disorders, but extends to other disorders where blood disharmony plays an important role, for example skin diseases such as eczema and urticaria.

Finally Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 is cited in the Song of the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang, for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc.
