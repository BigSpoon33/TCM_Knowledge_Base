## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Gōngsūn SP-4 is the luo-connecting point of the Spleen channel and the confluent point of the Penetrating vessel. Its principal actions are to harmonise the middle jiao, fortify the Spleen, regulate stagnant qi and transform dampness. One explanation of the name 'Grandfather Grandson' refers to its status as the luo-connecting point, the Spleen channel being the grandfather and the Stomach channel the grandson. An alternative explanation is that it refers to the Yellow Emperor, whose family name was Gongsun and who ruled under the earth phase, emphasising the significant action of this point on both the Spleen and the Stomach.

The Stomach and Spleen (which together comprise the middle jiao) are intimately related and their functions and nature complement each other. The 'rotting and ripening' of food and drink in the Stomach, the first stage of the digestive process, is ultimately governed by the Spleen. The Spleen ascends whilst the Stomach descends; the Spleen abhors dampness whilst the Stomach abhors dryness. Gōngsūn SP-4 connects with the Stomach channel (via the luo-connecting channel) and with the Stomach and intestines themselves (via the primary and luo-connecting channels). It is ideally suited, therefore, to harmonise the relationship between this paired zang and fu, and is indicated on the one hand for vomiting, cold in the Stomach, no pleasure in eating and oesophageal constriction, and on the other hand for borborygmus, diarrhoea, dysenteric disorder, tenesmus etc. It is also indicated for sudden turmoil disorder - the sudden and acute onset of simultaneous diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort or pain. This disease is associated with eating unclean food, or with attack of cold, summer-heat, dampness or epidemic qi.

The Spleen channel meets with the Conception vessel on the abdomen both below and above the umbilicus (Zhōngjí REN-3, Guānyuán REN-4 and Xiàwǎn REN-10), whilst the Penetrating vessel passes through all the Kidney channel points of the lower and upper abdomen. In clinical practice, Gōngsūn SP-4 is an important point to treat upper and lower abdominal distention or pain due to qi stagnation, blood stasis or obstruction by dampness. According to the discussion of the 'eight therapeutic methods' in the Ode of the Obstructed River, Gōngsūn SP-4 is particularly indicated for abdominal pain below the umbilicus. Other sources emphasise its effectiveness for both epigastric pain and periumbilical pain. Whilst all sources therefore agree on its ability to treat abdominal pain, the variance in opinion on its precise sphere of action reflects both its effect on the Stomach in the upper abdomen and the intestines (via the Spleen) in the lower abdomen, and the pathways of the channels which it influences.

In common with the other luo-connecting points of the yin channels (Lièquē LU-7, Tōnglǐ HE-5, Dàzhōng KID-4, Nèiguān P-6 and Lǐgōu LIV-5) Gōngsūn SP-4 has a pronounced effect on emotional disorders. The Spleen channel connects with the Heart, and when phlegm and dampness accumulate and transform into phlegm-heat, this may be carried upwards to obstruct the Heart and agitate the spirit giving rise to mania-depression, manic raving, insomnia, restlessness and epilepsy. Alternatively, if Spleen qi is deficient, the source of blood will be weak and the Heart and spirit will lack nourishment resulting in insomnia and restlessness. Unusually for a Spleen channel point, Gōngsūn SP-4 is also indicated for Gall Bladder deficiency and much sighing. For a fuller discussion of this pattern, see Dǎnshū BL-19.

The Penetrating vessel disperses in the chest, whilst the Spleen channel connects with the Heart, chest and lateral costal region. The Complete Collection of Acupuncture and Moxibustion recommends Gōngsūn SP-4 for the 'nine types of Heart pain' as well as for low-grade pain of the chest. Nèiguān P-6, the confluent point of the Yin Linking vessel is frequently combined with Gōngsūn SP-4, the confluent point of the Penetrating vessel, to enhance the latter's ability to treat Heart and chest pain, as well as to calm the spirit and regulate qi in the middle jiao and hence treat pain, distention and nausea.

The Penetrating vessel (known as the sea of blood) originates in the lower abdomen and has a specific effect on the uterus. The Classic of the Jade Dragon states that Gōngsūn SP-4 may be used for 'all gynaecological disorders'. Despite this recommendation, however, it is notable that other gynaecological indications in both classical and modern texts are relatively few.

One pathway of the Penetrating vessel ascends to the face, and Gōngsūn SP-4 is indicated (and included in various classical combinations) for oedema, especially swelling of the face. Finally the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion gives specific indications for excess and deficiency of the luo-connecting points. In the case of Gōngsūn SP-4, these are cutting pain of the intestines (excess); drum distention (deficiency).
