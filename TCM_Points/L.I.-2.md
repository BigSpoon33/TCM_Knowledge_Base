## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the Classic of Difficulties3 ying-spring points are indicated for "heat in the body". Èrjiān L.I.-2, the ying-spring point of the Large Intestine channel, clears heat and expels wind from the upper reaches of the channel in the teeth, nose, face, throat and eyes.

It is useful to view the Large Intestine channel in relationship both to the Lung channel, with which it is interiorly-exteriorly coupled, and to the Stomach channel with which it is paired according to six channel theory (yangming). The Large Intestine channel may be seen as the exterior reflection of the Lung, and its distal points such as Èrjiān L.I.-2 are used to expel wind-heat from the exterior portion of the Lung, especially the throat and nose, being indicated for sore throat, rhinitis and nosebleed accompanied by fever and shivering. As far as the Stomach is concerned, accumulated heat in the Stomach and Large Intestine may be transmitted along the hand yangming channel and give rise to inflammation of the throat, dry mouth and toothache. Various classical sources have emphasised the use of Èrjiān L.I.-2 for toothache, rather than the more commonly-used Hégǔ L.I.-4, which may be seen as a reflection of the dynamic and urgent quality of the more distal point. Although the Large Intestine channel does not reach the eye, its coupled yangming Stomach channel originates at the eye and this explains the ability of Èrjiān L.I.-2 to treat eye diseases.

The indications for Èrjiān L.I.-2 include propensity to fright and somnolence. It also appears in combination for toothache with lumbar pain, and, with several points of the Kidney channel, for somnolence. These indications hint at Kidney disharmony, and it may be that as the water point of the Large Intestine metal channel, Èrjiān L.I.-2 was considered effective in the treatment of deficiency patterns of the Kidneys.

Finally the Large Intestine muscle and divergent channels both connect with the spine, and Èrjiān L.I.-2 is indicated for pain and stiffness of the shoulder and back.

Summary of clinical application:
Clears heat and expels wind from the upper reaches of the channel in the teeth, nose, face and throat: toothache, pain and swelling of the lower cheek, deviation of the mouth and eye, nosebleed, rhinitis, throat painful obstruction, acute weeping eczema of the face, eye diseases.
