## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Ch«êz√© LU-5 is the water and he-sea point of the Lung channel. Its principal action is to clear all forms of heat (whether excess or deficient) from the Lung, and to descend Lung qi.

Excess heat in the Lung may be due to interior or exterior factors. Interior factors include smoking, over-consumption of rich, greasy, spicy food and alcohol, transformation of long-standing retention of phlegm-damp into phlegm-heat, and invasion by Liver fire. Exterior factors include pathogenic wind-cold or wind-heat which penetrate the Lung zang and transform into heat. Deficiency heat in the Lung may be due either to depletion and exhaustion of Lung and Kidney yin, or to damage to Lung yin by long-standing or repeated attacks of excess heat. The presence of any form of heat in the Lung will disturb its function of descending qi and lead to such symptoms of rebellion of Lung qi as coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing and asthma. In the case of excess heat there may be coughing of phlegm and agitation and fullness of the chest, whilst in cases of deficiency heat there may be tidal fever or taxation fever and dry mouth and tongue.

Whilst equally applicable to cases of both excess and deficiency heat, the appropriate combination of Ch«êz√© LU-5 with other points will determine the different approach required in the treatment of these two conditions. In the case of excess heat, characterised by fullness in the chest and expectoration of yellow, green or brown phlegm, it may be combined with points to transform phlegm and clear heat such as Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40 and Zh≈çngf«î LU-1. In the case of deficiency heat, characterised by dry mouth and tongue and tidal fever or taxation fever, it may be combined with points to nourish yin and moisten the Lung such as T√†iyuƒÅn LU-9, GƒÅohuƒÅngsh≈´ BL-43 and T√†ixƒ´ KID-3.

According to the Classic of Difficulties12 he-sea points are indicated for "counterflow qi and diarrhoea", whilst the Spiritual Pivot says "in disorders of the Stomach and in disorders resulting from irregular eating and drinking, select the he-sea point"13. The Lung and Stomach both dominate descending whilst the Lung channel arises in the middle jiao, in the region of the Stomach. In addition to descending rebellious Lung qi, Ch«êz√© LU-5 also treats vomiting due to rebellious Stomach qi, as well as diarrhoea and abdominal distention.

The Discourse Into the Origins and Development of Medicine says "The Lung is the delicate zang, neither heat nor cold is appropriate ... too hot and the fire will melt the metal and the blood will stir". Heat in the Lung, whether of deficient or excess type, may injure the blood vessels and give rise to reckless bleeding, characterised by coughing or spitting of blood or nosebleed. As well as being indicated for heat-induced bleeding from the Lung, due to its secondary action of descending Stomach qi Ch«êz√© LU-5 may also be used for vomiting blood. The Song of Points for Miscellaneous Diseases states uncompromisingly "In cases of vomiting blood the action of Ch«êz√© LU-5 is without comparison"14.

The close relationship of the Lung to body fluids is emphasised in two sayings of Chinese medicine "The Lung is the upper source of water" and "The Lung dominates the movement of water". If exterior pathogenic wind obstructs the Lung's function of regulating the water passages and descending body fluid, there may be urinary retention as well as swelling of the four limbs. If the Lung is deficient, there may be enuresis or frequent urination. Ch«êz√© LU-5 is indicated in both these patterns.

The Lung and Heart dominate the upper jiao and share an intimate relationship. The Warp and Woof of Warm Febrile Disease says "The Lung and Heart are mutually connected; when there is Lung heat it most easily enters the Heart". When Lung heat transmits to the Heart there will be agitation, whilst if heat condenses the blood and gives rise to blood stasis, there will be Heart pain. In both these situations Ch«êz√© LU-5 is indicated.

Occupying a central position along the Lung channel, Ch«êz√© LU-5 has an important effect on the whole upper limb, and is indicated for disorders of the channel in the shoulder, upper arm, elbow and hand characterised by pain and restricted motion. Migratory pain due to attack of pathogenic wind-damp is known as wandering painful obstruction or wind painful obstruction, and as well as being indicated for wandering painful obstruction of the upper arm and elbow, Ch«êz√© LU-5 appears in classical combinations for wind painful obstruction of the whole body. Many classical sources particularly mention the ability of Ch«êz√© LU-5 to relax contraction of the sinews, for example the Song of the Jade Dragon says "In contraction of the sinews with difficulty in opening and extending the hand, the use of Ch«êz√© LU-5 should always be emphasised". Its use in the treatment of pain and contraction of the elbow is self-evident, and it is especially useful in the treatment of tennis elbow in preference to Q≈´ch√≠ L.I.-11, as a needle inserted at Ch«êz√© LU-5 can be more easily directed towards the area of acute focalised tenderness. Ch«êz√© LU-5 is also indicated for swelling and pain of the knee (crane's knee wind) reflecting the commonly used 'cross-connection' method of needling the equivalently positioned joint in the upper limb to treat disorders of the lower limb and vice-versa.

Interestingly, Ch«êz√© LU-5 also treats 'the five types of lumbar pain'. In a sense this point, located in the flexure of the elbow joint, can be viewed as the equivalent on the upper limb of Wƒõizh≈çng BL-40 which is located in the flexure of the knee joint and is much used for lumbar pain.

Summary of clinical application
Important point to clear excess or deficiency heat from the Lung: coughing, coughing phlegm, shortness of breath, fullness of the chest, wheezing, asthma.
For heat-induced bleeding from the Lung or Stomach: vomiting or coughing of blood, nosebleed.
Regulates urination: swelling of the four limbs, enuresis, frequent urination.
Regulates the Lung and Heart: pain and agitation of the Heart.
Occupies a central position on the arm and treats pain and restricted movement of the shoulder, upper arm, elbow and hand, especially wandering pain. Also lumbar and knee pain.
