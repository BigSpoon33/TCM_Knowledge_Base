## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Zhìbiān BL-54 is an indispensable point in the treatment of pain of the lumbar region, sacrum and buttocks and of sciatica. Along with Bāohuāng BL-53 and Huántiào GB-30, Zhìbiān BL-54 is one of the points that should be palpated, and needled if tender, in all cases where pain radiates to the buttock and down the leg.

According to Investigation Into Points Along the Channels by Yan Zhen-shi of the Ming dynasty, Zhìbiān BL-54 is indicated for "Kidney deficiency lumbar pain, seminal emission and turbid leucorrhoea". This quotation emphasises that the use of Zhìbiān BL-54 in the treatment of lumbar pain is not confined to cases of stagnation (such as painful obstruction), but extends also to aching of the lumbar region due to weakness of the Kidneys.

In common with many points of the sacral region which lies over the Bladder and intestines, Zhìbiān BL-54 is able to regulate obstructed and difficult urination and defecation. Zhìbiān BL-54 is also mentioned in a number of classics for the treatment of "the five types of haemorrhoids with swelling".
