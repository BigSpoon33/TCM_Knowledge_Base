## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The Sanjiao channel both encircles and enters the ear, and Zhōngzhǔ SJ-3 is one of the most important distal points for treating ear disorders due to any pathology. Tinnitus and deafness may be differentiated into six main patterns i. attack by exterior pathogenic wind, ii. uprising of Liver fire or Liver yang, iii. obstruction of the ear by phlegm-damp or phlegm-heat, iv. Kidney deficiency, v. Spleen and Stomach deficiency, and vi. traumatic injury or exposure to sudden or persistent loud noise. Zhōngzhǔ SJ-3 is particularly suited to treating the first two patterns (exterior wind and Liver disharmony). This is because, like most distal points of the Sanjiao channel, it is able to expel exterior pathogens, and also as the wood point of the Sanjiao channel it can assist in descending Liver fire or Liver yang which have transmitted to the shaoyang channel. Due to the intimate relationship of the Sanjiao channel with the ear, however, the application of Zhōngzhǔ SJ-3 extends to the treatment of any pattern of tinnitus and deafness, especially when due to excess. Zhōngzhǔ SJ-3 is equally important as a distal point in the treatment of disorders such as earache, otitis media and blockage of the ears following a head cold. In blockage of the ears during or following flying, Zhōngzhǔ SJ-3 may be massaged or needled whilst the patient pinches their nose shut and attempts to blow through it.

When heat or fire, whether of internal or external origin, harass the Sanjiao channel in the upper body, there may be one-sided headache, pain of the temples, dizziness, redness, swelling and pain of the eyes, throat painful obstruction and red face. In all these situations Zhōngzhǔ SJ-3 will help lower and clear the excess heat.

According to the Spiritual Pivot "Taiyang is the opening, yangming is the closing and shaoyang is the pivot". In the six channel differentiation of fevers expounded in the Treatise on Injury by Cold, the shaoyang level is the pivot between the interior and the exterior, and shaoyang pattern occurs when the pathogenic factor is trapped between these two levels. The characteristic symptoms of this 'half-interior, half-exterior' pattern are distinct phases of fever alternating with chills (typified by malaria). The Sanjiao shaoyang channel belongs to fire, and many of its points are effective in reducing fever. Zhōngzhǔ SJ-3 is indicated for chills and fever, fever accompanied by headache, and especially for chronic malarial fever.

According to the Classic of Difficulties5 shu-stream points are indicated for heaviness of the body and pain of the joints. Zhōngzhǔ SJ-3 is an important point to circulate the qi of the channel and is indicated in the treatment of pain of the shoulder and elbow, pain of the spine (at the level of the Heart), numbness of the four limbs and inability to flex and extend the fingers.

Summary of clinical application

For pain of the shoulder and elbow, pain of the spine (at the level of the Heart), numbness of the four limbs and inability to flex and extend the fingers.
