## 📍 Location

On the upper arm, where the line drawn between Tiānjǐng SJ-10 and Jiānliáo SJ-14 meets the posterior border of the deltoid muscle, approximately two thirds of the distance between these two points.

**Location Notes:**
i. Locate in the depression within the triceps muscle, posterior to the shaft of the humerus (between the muscle bellies of the long and lateral heads of the triceps); ii. Although most sources specify both a distance of 3 cun from Jiānliáo SJ-14 and a location at the posterior border of the deltoid muscle, these do not usually correspond. In practice, palpate the region of this point to find the most tender location.

## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Like several of its neighbouring points (e.g. Tiānfǔ LU-3, Shǒuwǔlǐ L.I.-13, Bìnào L.I.-14, Jiānyú L.I.-15 and Tiānjǐng SJ-10), Nāohuì SJ-13 is indicated for scrofula and goitre. These two disorders, although different in aetiology, always involve phlegm combined either with stagnant qi or with heat. In the case of Nāohuì SJ-13, its ability to treat these disorders derives partly from the pathways of the Sanjiao channel and the Yang Linking vessel, which pass through the neck, and partly from the inherent relationship of the Sanjiao to the transformation of fluids and the circulation of qi. Ultimately, however, there is no clear theoretical explanation why points of the upper arm, rather than more distal points, have a special action on these disorders, and this is primarily the fruit of empirical observation and clinical practice. Like Bìnào L.I.-14, Nāohuì SJ-13 is also indicated for eye disorders.

The more common clinical application of Nāohuì SJ-13 is for pain of the upper arm, or for shoulder pain which radiates down the upper arm.

Summary of clinical application
Treats goitre and scrofula (neck or axillary nodules) due to phlegm combined either with stagnant qi or with heat.
For pain of the upper arm, or for shoulder pain which radiates down the upper arm.
