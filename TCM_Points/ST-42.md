## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

In terms of its actions and indications Chōngyáng ST-42, the yuan-source point of the Stomach channel, is similar to Jiěxī ST-41, although less commonly used in current-day clinical practice.

Chōngyáng ST-42 is located over the pulsation of the dorsalis pedis artery, and the Essential Questions suggests that the knee be raised in order to allow the artery to pulsate more clearly and thus assist in locating this point. This advice is echoed by the traditional observation that if the point Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is obstructed, the beating of the artery will be diminished, and in fact if the point Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is pressed firmly, the pulsation will disappear entirely.

Summary of clinical application
Similar to Jiěxī ST-41, but less commonly used.
The Essential Questions advises that the knee should be raised to allow the dorsalis pedis artery to pulsate more clearly and thus assist in locating this point. In fact if Zúsānlǐ ST-36 (located near the knee) is pressed firmly, the pulsation will disappear entirely.
