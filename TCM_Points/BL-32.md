## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

The points Sh√†ngli√°o BL-31, C√¨li√°o BL-32, Zh≈çngli√°o BL-33 and Xi√†li√°o BL-34 are often considered as a group and are known as Baliao (Eight Crevices). In terms of their actions and indications they are very similar, sharing the common characteristics of regulating various disorders of the lower jiao, specifically: i. The urinary system. C√¨li√°o BL-32 and to a lesser extent Zh≈çngli√°o BL-33 are the strongest in their action on the urinary system, being indicated for such disorders as painful urinary dysfunction, retention of urine, difficult urination, enuresis etc. ii. The intestines. All four points treat difficult defecation, whilst Xi√†li√°o BL-34 has the widest action on the intestines, being indicated in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion for "borborygmus and diarrhoea, internal injury by damp and cold, blood in the stool", iii. Gynaecological disorders such as dysmenorrhoea, infertility, irregular menstruation and leucorrhoea as well as disorders of the genitals for which Xi√†li√°o BL-34 is the strongest (swelling and pain, incessant green leucorrhoea with vaginal pain, pain of the testicles); iv. Invigorating the flow of qi and blood in the channels and collaterals of the local area and lower limbs, with C√¨li√°o BL-32 and Zh≈çngli√°o BL-33 having the strongest action in their ability to treat disorders such as lumbar pain, sacral pain, atrophy disorder and painful obstruction of the lower limbs etc.

Zh≈çngli√°o BL-33 is indicated for "the five taxations, the seven injuries and the six extremes", all forms of extreme exhaustion. This underlines a further aspect of the actions of the eight liao as a whole, which is to benefit, warm, firm and supplement the Kidneys, having amongst their indications impotence, infertility, seminal emission and incessant white leucorrhoea. All eight liao are specifically indicated for difficulty in urination and/or defecation. Kidney deficiency is an important underlying pattern for this disorder, which is frequently seen in elderly and weak patients. Sun Si-miao, for example, in the Thousand Ducat Formulas prescribed moxibustion at all eight liao for difficult urination and defecation.

In clinical practice, C√¨li√°o BL-32 is the most commonly used of the four points, having the most wide-ranging indications. It is frequently used in the treatment of dysmenorrhoea which radiates to the sacral area, as well as for back pain during labour. To relieve labour pain, needling C√¨li√°o BL-32 is often combined with electro-acupuncture. For this purpose the handle of the needle may be bent to 90 degrees and taped to the skin, allowing the woman to lie on her back.
