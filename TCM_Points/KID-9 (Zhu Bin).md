## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Zhúbīn KID-9 is the xi-cleft point of the Yin Linking vessel which connects the yin channels of both hand and foot and the Conception vessel. The Yin Linking vessel has a special action on the Heart, thus the Classic of Difficulties24 says "When the Yin Linking vessel is diseased, Heart pain will result”. The traditional indications of this point do not include Heart pain, but they do clearly reveal a pattern of phlegm or phlegm-fire obstructing the Heart giving rise to madness, mania, mania depression disorder, raving, fury and cursing and vomiting of foamy (watery) saliva. Phlegm and qi coagulating in the neck region give rise to goitre, whilst tongue thrusting (where the tongue is repeatedly thrust out of the mouth like a snake's tongue) may be due to accumulated heat of the Heart and Spleen.

Summary of clinical application
Clears the Heart and resolves phlegm: madness, mania, mania depression disorder, raving, fury and cursing, vomiting of foamy (watery) saliva, goitre.
Also indicated for shan disorder, umbilical shan disorder in infants, pain of the medial aspect of the leg, contraction of the calf muscle, weakness of the legs.
