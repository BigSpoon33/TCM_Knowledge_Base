## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the Essential Questions10 "the knees are the residence of the sinews; when the knees are unable to flex and extend and walking is achieved with a hunched back and the help of a cane, then the sinews are exhausted". Yánglíngquán GB-34, located just inferior to the knee joint, is the hui-meeting point of the sinews and has long been considered the main point to influence these tissues throughout the body, for example the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion simply stated "for diseases of the sinews select Yánglíngquán GB-34".

The Gall Bladder is interiorly-exteriorly related with the Liver which dominates and nourishes the sinews, and Yánglíngquán GB-34, the he-sea point of the Gall Bladder channel, is an essential point for contraction of the sinews and stiffness and tightness of the muscles and joints, and most especially for disorders of the leg such as knee pain, hip pain, sciatica, hemiplegia, atrophy disorder and painful obstruction. The importance of Yánglíngquán GB-34 in disorders of the lower leg as a whole is further emphasised by its inclusion in Ma Dan-yang's 'eleven heavenly star points'9, his grouping of the most vital acupuncture points. According to this great physician of the Jin dynasty, Yánglíngquán GB-34 was indicated for swelling and numbness of the knee, cold painful obstruction, hemiplegia and inability to raise the leg. The action of Yánglíngquán GB-34 is not confined to the lower limb, however, and it may be used in the treatment of stiffness of the neck and shoulders and pain of the sinews in the elbow, for example tennis elbow. In summary, Yánglíngquán GB-34 may be used for pain, cramping, contraction, stiffness and sprain of the sinews and muscles in any part of the body.

It is a characteristic of the channels, especially the yang channels, that points located at the extremities tend to influence most strongly the extreme opposite end of the channel (i.e. the head region), whilst points located towards the elbow or knee tend to have their strongest influence on the middle region of the body. Yánglíngquán GB-34 clearly demonstrates this principle and is an essential point to treat all disorders of the lateral costal region whether due to stagnation of qi, stasis of blood, accumulation of damp-heat, or deficiency of blood or yin. This is reflected in the unequivocal statements in the Song of Points for Miscellaneous Diseases which says "Pain of the lateral costal region, you only need Yánglíngquán GB-34", and the Ode of Essentials of Understanding which says "when there is pain of the lateral costal region and of the ribs, needling Yánglíngquán GB-34 will alleviate the pain promptly". The special affinity of Yánglíngquán GB-34 for the lateral costal region reflects both the course of the Gall Bladder channel which traverses this area, and its actions of spreading Liver qi and clearing Liver and Gall Bladder damp-heat, and thus treating two of the main patterns in distention and pain of this region.

Yánglíngquán GB-34 is the he-sea point of the Gall Bladder channel. According to the Spiritual Pivot11 "He-sea points treat the internal fu". The primary disharmony of the Gall Bladder is accumulation of damp-heat which may arise from i. failure of the Spleen transportation and transformation function leading to accumulation of either dampness or damp-heat which obstruct the function of the Liver and Gall Bladder, ii. over-consumption of rich greasy food or alcohol, iii. attack of external pathogenic damp-heat, or iv. stagnation of Liver qi which both obstructs the movement of fluids and transforms into heat, giving rise to damp-heat. Whatever the aetiology, Yánglíngquán GB-34 can be used to clear damp-heat from the Gall Bladder, manifesting with symptoms such as bitter taste in the mouth, nausea and vomiting, jaundice, cholecystitis etc. Another reflection of the influence of Yánglíngquán GB-34 on the fu is its application in the treatment of constipation, particularly when due to qi stagnation or heat.

According to both the Spiritual Pivot12 and the Essential Questions13 "Taiyang is the opening, yangming is the closing and shaoyang is the pivot". In the differentiation of fevers expounded in the Treatise on Injury by Cold, the shaoyang level is the pivot between the interior and the exterior, and shaoyang pattern occurs when the pathogenic factor is trapped between these two levels. The characteristic symptoms of this 'half-interior, half-exterior' pattern are distinct phases of fever alternating with chills, bitter taste in the mouth, pain of the lateral costal region, dryness of the mouth and throat, and nausea and vomiting. Yánglíngquán GB-34, the he-sea point of the foot shaoyang channel, is one of the main points to treat this pattern and is therefore indicated for any disorder with this presentation including malaria.

According to Achieving Longevity by Guarding the Source, the 17th Century classic by Gong Ting-xin, "Susceptibility to fright ... timidity in which the patient fears being apprehended, all result from deficiency of the qi of Heart and Gall Bladder ". Yánglíngquán GB-34 is indicated for "fear of people as if about to be apprehended" and frequent sighing, reflecting a pattern of Gall Bladder qi deficiency.

Finally, the Spiritual Pivot14 says "in disorders of the Stomach and in disorders resulting from irregular eating and drinking, select the he-sea point". Yánglíngquán GB-34 is indicated in cases where qi stagnation generates phlegm and heat which obstruct the Stomach and impair its descending function. This combined pattern of Gall Bladder and Stomach disharmony manifests with such symptoms as bitter taste in the mouth, nausea and vomiting.

Summary of clinical application
Main point for disorders of the sinews in any region of the body: contraction of the sinews, stiffness and tightness of the muscles and joints, numbness, stiffness of the neck and shoulders, pain of the elbow.
Major point for all disorders of the lower limb: knee pain, hip pain, sciatica, hemiplegia, atrophy disorder, painful obstruction.
Treats all disorders of the lateral costal region.
Dispels damp-heat from the Gall Bladder, phlegm-heat from the Stomach and pathogens from shaoyang: alternating fever and chills, pain of the lateral costal region, bitter taste in the mouth, dryness of the mouth and throat, nausea and vomiting, jaundice, cholecystitis.
Tonifies Gall Bladder qi: fearfulness, frequent sighing.
