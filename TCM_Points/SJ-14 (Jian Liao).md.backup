## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Jiānliáo SJ-14 is an important point for treating all disorders of the shoulder joint, especially the posterior aspect. Stiffness, pain, immobility and weakness of the shoulder or frozen shoulder may derive from: i. injury by exterior pathogenic wind, cold, damp or heat, ii. stagnation of qi and blood from traumatic injury or overuse, or iii. deficiency of qi and blood from overuse, old age or prolonged obstruction of the channel. In all these cases Jiānliáo SJ-14 may be used, and in clinical practice is commonly combined with Jiānyú L.I.-15.

Summary of clinical application
Important point for treating all disorders of the shoulder joint, especially the posterior aspect, including stiffness, pain, weakness, immobility, and frozen shoulder.
Commonly combined with Jiānyú L.I.-15 for shoulder and arm disorders.
