## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Juéyīnshū BL-14 is an exception among the back-shu points in that all the others are named after their respective zang or fu. The fact that Juéyīnshū BL-14 is named after the jueyin (Pericardium and Liver) channel emphasises its ability to unbind the chest by invigorating the circulation of qi. When Liver qi stagnates, usually as a result of emotional factors, it frequently binds the qi of the upper jiao giving rise to symptoms such as pain and oppression of the Heart, chest and diaphragm, restlessness, agitation and oppression.

As the back-shu point of the Pericardium, Juéyīnshū BL-14 is not exclusively reserved for chest and Heart disorders due to qi stagnation, but in combination with Xīnshū BL-15 is widely used to regulate the Heart in many kinds of dysfunction.

The descending function of both the Stomach and Lung is assisted by the smooth and unobstructed movement of Liver qi. When Liver qi stagnates and impairs their descent, there may be cough and vomiting respectively.

Summary of clinical application
Back-shu point of the Pericardium (jueyin) which is intimately linked to the Liver (jueyin).
Regulates qi in the chest, Heart and Lung: pain or oppression of the Heart, chest and diaphragm due to accumulation of qi, palpitations, cough, shortness of breath, rebellious qi vomiting.
