## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

As its name implies, Shu«êfƒìn REN-9 (Water Separation) has a strong action on fluid transformation and distribution and is particularly indicated for oedema. According to the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Shu«êfƒìn REN-9 is located over the Small Intestine which has the function of 'separating the clear from the turbid' and sending fluids to the Bladder and solid dregs to the Large Intestine for excretion. This Small Intestine function is dominated by the Spleen and Kidneys, and Shu«êfƒìn REN-9 is particularly indicated for yin oedema due to deficiency of the Spleen and/or Kidneys, especially oedema of the abdominal region. Many early texts specify that in the treatment of oedema this point should be treated by moxibustion rather than needling.

Impairment of the function of the intestines may give rise to severe stagnation and, by blocking its descent, cause rebellion of Stomach qi. Shu«êfƒìn REN-9 is indicated for distention and pain of the abdomen, drum-like swelling and hardness of the abdomen, periumbilical pain rushing up to the chest and Heart causing difficulty in breathing, loss of appetite, acid regurgitation and vomiting.

The action of Shu«êfƒìn REN-9 in treating these kinds of accumulation of water, qi and food reflects its ability to harmonise the intestinal region and promote smooth circulation rather than to directly tonify the Spleen or Kidneys.

Summary of clinical application
Important point for oedema, especially oedema due to deficiency of the Spleen and/or Kidneys and oedema of the abdominal region.
Treats intestinal stagnation: distention and pain of the abdomen, drum-like swelling and hardness of the abdomen, periumbilical pain rushing up to the chest and Heart causing difficulty in breathing, loss of appetite, acid regurgitation, vomiting.
