## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Bǐngfēng SI-12 is a meeting point of the Small Intestine channel with the Large Intestine, Sanjiao and Gall Bladder channels, all of which traverse the scapular and shoulder regions and the neck. As its name 'Grasping Wind' (and by implication controlling wind) implies, Bǐngfēng SI-12 is a useful local point to invigorate these channels and expel pathogenic wind which has lodged in the muscles of the shoulder and scapula. Although most classical and contemporary sources recommend this point for local disorders only, the Ming dynasty classic Investigation Into Points Along the Channels suggests a broader action of expelling wind and recommends the use of Bǐngfēng SI-12 "when the interstices and pores do not close properly, wind pathogen easily enters [resulting in] cough with stubborn phlegm".

Summary of clinical application
Local point for disorders of the shoulder, scapula and neck, especially when due to wind invasion.
