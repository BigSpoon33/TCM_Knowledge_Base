## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Yongquan KID-1, the only channel point on the sole of the foot and therefore the lowest point on the body, is the wood point of the Kidney water channel. According to the Classic of Difficulties2 ‚Äúin cases of deficiency reinforce the mother, in cases of excess reduce the child‚Äù. As the ‚Äòchild‚Äô point of the Kidney channel, Yongquan KID-1 therefore has a powerful effect on reducing excess above by 'returning the unrooted back to its source', reflected both in the statement in the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries that ‚ÄúYongquan KID-1 echoes the earth‚Äù3 , and in alternative names for this point such as ‚ÄòEarth Surge‚Äô (Dichong) and ‚ÄòEarth Thoroughfare‚Äô (Dichong).

When the Kidneys are deficient below, pathologically ascending qi, yang, deficiency heat or wind may rush upwards to harass the head. The powerful effect of Yongquan KID-1 on descending and clearing such excess is recorded in a story about the famous 2nd century physician Hua Tuo who treated General Wei Tai-cu (the posthumously consecrated emperor of the Wei dynasty) for ‚Äòhead wind, confused mind and visual dizziness‚Äô. Following the principle of selecting points below to treat disorders above, Hua Tuo needled Yongquan KID-1 and ‚Äúthe general was immediately cured‚Äù4 .

In clinical practice, Yongquan KID-1 is principally used to treat: i. uprising of Liver yang, Liver fire or Liver wind, ii. disharmony of the Heart and Kidneys, and iii. disorders of the throat.

The Kidneys are the root of the yin of all the zangfu. This has especial relevance to the Liver, Heart and Lung, all of which are reached by the Kidney channel. According to a saying of Chinese medicine ‚Äúthe Kidneys and the Liver share the same origin‚Äù. Kidney water is the mother of Liver wood, and the Kidney yin is the origin and source of Liver yin. When Kidney water fails to nourish Liver wood, the fierce and unrestrained yang of the Liver rushes up to the head giving rise to such symptoms as headache at the vertex, dizziness, visual dizziness, cloudy vision, hypertension and nosebleed. If excess Liver yang generates wind there may be windstroke or epilepsy. Yongquan KID-1 is able both to regulate the Kidneys, the root of these symptoms, and to treat the manifestations by strongly descending the pathological excess.

The Kidneys belong to water and the Heart to fire, and the Kidneys and Heart are said to ‚Äòmutually support‚Äô each other, the Kidney yin nourishing and moistening Heart yin and restraining Heart fire, and Heart yang descending to warm the Kidneys. Harmony between the Kidneys and Heart is one of the prerequisites for a stable and peaceful spirit. When Kidney yin is deficient and deficiency fire of the Heart blazes, or when the connection is broken and the Kidneys and Heart do not communicate, the spirit becomes agitated, leading to a wide variety of emotional disorders ranging from the relatively mild, (agitation, insomnia, poor memory, propensity to fear) to the severe (madness, rage with desire to kill people). It is recommended (and widely applied in China) for patients suffering from insomnia to massage bilateral Yongquan KID-1 before bedtime, or to steep the feet in a bowl of hot water to draw down the excess yang.

The ability of Yongquan KID-1 to restrain uprising of deficiency heat and Liver yang, and to pacify the spirit, renders it especially suitable to treat menopausal disorder characterised by hot flushes, night sweating, insomnia, agitation, anxiety and headache.

The Kidney channel ascends to the throat and the root of the tongue. When fierce heat from Kidney deficiency rises along the Kidney channel, it scorches the fluids and gives rise to swelling and congestion of the throat, throat pain with inability to swallow and dry tongue. Because of its ability to reduce heat and fire in the throat region, Yongquan KID-1 may also be used in swelling and pain of the throat due to other aetiologies. According to the Spiritual Pivot5 the Kidney channel terminates at Lianquan REN-23, an important point in the treatment of disorders of the tongue, and Yongquan KID-1 is also indicated for loss of voice, whether due to exterior pathogens or to windstroke.

Yongquan KID-1 is secondarily used for: i. disorders of the Lung, ii. running piglet qi, iii. loss of consciousness, and iv. disorders of the two lower yin.

According to a saying of Chinese medicine ‚ÄúThe Lung is the canopy and the Kidneys are the root‚Äù. As the uppermost zang, the Lung receives via respiration the clear qi of heaven (qing qi) in the same way that the canopy of a forest receives the light and air essential for life. Through the grasping and holding function of the Kidneys, the qi is drawn down via inhalation to the root below. If the Kidneys are deficient and fail to grasp the qi, there may be dyspnoea and coughing, both indications for this point.

Running piglet qi primarily arises when stagnant Liver qi transforms to heat, or when Kidney yang deficiency leads to accumulation of cold in the lower jiao. In both cases, qi is violently discharged and rushes upwards along the Penetrating vessel. The action of Yongquan KID-1 in harmonising the Kidneys and Liver and redirecting pathologically ascending qi downwards is reflected in its use in the treatment of this disorder.

Yongquan KID-1 is the jing-well point of the Kidney channel, and like many of the other jing-well points has a powerful action on opening the portals and reviving collapse, whether in windstroke or loss of consciousness. It is cited in the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc.

The Kidneys rule the two lower yin, the anus and urethra. Yongquan KID-1 may be used in the treatment of constipation, especially when due to yin deficiency and consequent dryness, as well as for difficult urination.

Yongquan KID-1 is an important point in qigong practice. Directing the mind to Yongquan KID-1, or inhaling and exhaling through this point, roots and descends the qi in the lower dantian (cinnabar field) and helps the body absorb the yin energy of the earth. In common with its application in acupuncture, this practice is particularly recommended whenever excessive yang rebels upwards to the Heart, Lung or head.

Finally, Yongquan KID-1 has been the subject of many modern studies into the application of herbal plasters to acupuncture points. A variety of herbal substances are ground, made into a paste and applied to this point for disorders such as mouth ulcers and hypertension.
