## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Although not a major point, Bìnào L.I.-14 is frequently employed for channel disorders in the upper arm, especially when pain radiates either downwards from the shoulder towards the elbow, or upwards from the elbow towards the shoulder. Like several points of the Large Intestine and Sanjiao channels located between the elbow and the shoulder, Bìnào L.I.-14 is also indicated for scrofula and goitre. Scrofula and goitre, although different in aetiology, always involve phlegm, combined either with stagnant qi or with heat. In the case of Bìnào L.I.-14, its ability to treat these disorders derives mainly from the course of the Large Intestine channel through the lateral side of the neck, rather than a special ability to transform phlegm, and the action of 'regulating qi and transforming phlegm' in this context therefore only applies to scrofula and goitre. The explanation of why several points of the upper arm have this special action whilst the more distal shu-points do not, is unclear (see also Tiānfǔ LU-3, Jiānyú L.I.-15, Shǒuwǔlǐ L.I.-13, Tiānjǐng SJ-10 and Nāohuì SJ-13). Finally, Bìnào L.I.-14 also shares with several points of the upper arm the ability to treat disorders of the eyes, in this case redness, swelling and heat. Summary of clinical application: For local disorders, especially pain of the upper arm which radiates between the elbow and shoulder. For scrofula and goitre, and redness, swelling and pain of the eyes.
