## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Yǎmén DU-15, on the back of the neck just above the hairline, lies directly opposite the root of the tongue, and according the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion a channel from Yǎmén DU-15 (Gate of Muteness) binds at the root of the tongue. The Spiritual Pivot36 lists Yǎmén DU-15 as a point of the 'sea of qi' and states "When the sea of qi is deficient, there is scanty energy insufficient for speech". As early as the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, and reasserted in later texts, it was said that moxibustion at this point could cause a person to become mute, whilst needling it could cure muteness. These classical references provided the basis for the claims made during the turbulent years of the Cultural Revolution that deep needling of Yǎmén DU-15 could have almost miraculous effects in the treatment of deaf-mute children. Photographs were published of whole classrooms of previously deaf-mute children singing 'The East is Red'. Like many of the extreme claims made during this period, this was later discredited, indeed it was confirmed that many patients suffered injury to the spinal cord from excessively deep needling. Notwithstanding this reservation, Yǎmén DU-15 is one of the few acupuncture points classically indicated for loss of voice and muteness, as well as for stiffness and flaccidity of the tongue, and the condition known as lotus flower tongue (distention and prominence of the blood vessels beneath the tongue), all of which may prevent normal speech. The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion advises the use of Yǎmén DU-15 for "all kinds of yang heat and qi exuberance", whilst the Secrets of A Border Official says that it "drains all yang qi and heat". In this context, it is interesting to note that many of the tongue disorders referred to arise due to excess heat and yang exuberance.

The second principal action of Yǎmén DU-15 is to eliminate either exterior or interior wind giving rise to such symptoms as head wind, stiff neck, loss of consciousness, epilepsy, clonic spasm and chills and fever with absence of sweating. Moreover the location of this point on the neck, and the pathway of the Governing vessel through the spine, renders it suitable for the treatment of stiff neck and spine due to any aetiology. Like Dàzhuī DU-14, Yǎmén DU-15 is also indicated for nosebleed that does not stop.

Finally Yǎmén DU-15 is cited in the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc.
