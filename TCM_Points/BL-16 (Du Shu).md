## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Although conventionally categorised as the back-shu point of the Governing vessel, it is interesting to note that Dūshū BL-16 was not discussed at all in such texts as the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, the Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man or Elucidation of the Fourteen Channels. This downplaying of Dūshū BL-16 is reflected in other classics by the absence of any clear indications of disorders of the Governing vessel, and the general paucity of indications and classical combination for this point as a whole. Its modern use is in the treatment of various skin disorders including psoriasis, alopecia and generalised pruritis.

Summary of clinical application
Despite its status as the back-shu point of the Governing vessel, Dushu BL-16 has few indications of disorders of the Governing vessel.
Modern application in the treatment of various skin disorders including psoriasis, alopecia and generalised pruritis.
