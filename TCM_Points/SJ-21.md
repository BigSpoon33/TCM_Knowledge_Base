## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Ěrmén SJ-21 is the uppermost of three points anterior to the ear, the others being Tīnggōng SI-19 and Tīnghuì GB-2. All are frequently employed for the treatment of a wide variety of ear disorders including tinnitus, deafness, pain, itching and discharge. Due to the close proximity of these points and the similar indications for each, it is difficult to distinguish between them clinically. If it is necessary to needle points around the ear regularly, then these three points should be alternated.

Like Jiǎosūn SJ-20, Ěrmén SJ-21 is also indicated for toothache, tooth decay and stiffness of the lips.

Finally it is interesting to note that according to the arrangement of the Sanjiao channel points in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Ěrmén SJ-21 is the last point of the channel.

Summary of clinical application
Important point in the treatment of a wide variety of ear disorders, including tinnitus, deafness, impaired hearing, swelling of the ear, ear sores, ear pain or itching, discharge from the ear.
Also indicated for toothache, tooth decay and stiffness of the lips.
