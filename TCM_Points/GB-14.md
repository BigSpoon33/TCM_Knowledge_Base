## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

In theory, the forehead is most closely associated with the yangming channel. In clinical practice pain of the forehead region may be due to involvement either of yangming channel, in which case it is often accompanied by pain of the infraorbital region (often seen in sinusitis), or of shaoyang channel, in which case it is frequently accompanied by pain of the temporal or parietal regions and eye (often seen in migrainous headaches). Y√°ngb√°i GB-14 is a meeting point of the Gall Bladder shaoyang channel with the Stomach and Large Intestine yangming channels, and is therefore the pre-eminent local point in the treatment of pain of the forehead, whether due to interior disharmony or invasion of exterior pathogenic factors. Some classical sources, for example the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, also imply that Y√°ngb√°i GB-14 can dispel wind-cold from the body as a whole and recommend it for inability to get warm despite wearing much clothing, and shivering and aversion to cold on the back.

Y√°ngb√°i GB-14 is also an important local point for the treatment of various diseases of the eyes and eyelids due to a wide range of aetiologies, especially exterior or interior wind, manifesting as lacrimation, deviation of the eye, drooping, twitching or itching of the eyelids, pain and itching of the pupils and night-blindness.

Summary of clinical application
Meeting point of the Gall Bladder, Stomach and Large Intestine channels: important point for pain of the forehead whether extending to the eye, the infraorbital region (e.g. sinusitis) or the temporal or parietal regions.
Important local point for various diseases of the eyes and eyelids: lacrimation, deviation of the eye, drooping, twitching or itching of the eyelids, pain and itching of the pupils, nightblindness.
