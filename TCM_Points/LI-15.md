## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Jiānyú L.I.-15, a meeting point of the Large Intestine channel with the Yang Motility vessel, is also reached by the Lung and Bladder sinew channels, the Large Intestine divergent channel and the Small Intestine luo-connecting channel. Jiānyú L.I.-15 is considered the pre-eminent point for treating the shoulder, and clinically the majority of shoulder disorders affect this region.

Stiffness, pain, immobility or weakness of the shoulder or frozen shoulder may derive from: i. injury by exterior pathogenic wind, cold, damp or heat, i.e. painful obstruction, ii. stagnation of qi and blood from traumatic injury, misuse or overuse, or iii. deficiency of qi and blood from overuse, old age or prolonged obstruction of the channel. In all these cases Jiānyú L.I.-15 may be used, and in clinical practice is commonly combined with Jiānliáo SJ-14. As far as needling is concerned, there are two principal methods. For pain and immobility of the shoulder joint, the arm should be abducted as far as is comfortable and supported on a rolled pillow, whilst the needle is directed into the shoulder joint towards the centre of the axilla. For pain extending down the arm, however, Jiānyú L.I.-15 is usually needled with a transverse-oblique insertion towards the elbow joint.

The shoulder joint is the pivot of the arm. As Jiānyú L.I.-15 is the foremost point affecting the shoulder, lies on yangming channel which is "abundant in qi and blood", and is a meeting point with the Lung sinew and Small Intestine luo-connecting channels, it is a vital point to promote circulation of qi and blood in the upper limb as a whole, and is indicated for all kinds of atrophy disorder and painful obstruction and hemiplegia. For this purpose it is commonly combined in the 'chain and lock' method with points Qūchí L.I.-11 and Hégǔ L.I.-4.

Jiānyú L.I.-15 is also indicated in the treatment of urticaria due to attack of exterior wind-heat. This highlights the action of Jiānyú L.I.-15 in eliminating wind, which is emphasised in a variety of classical references to wind paralysis, windstroke, wind atrophy disorder and more generally simply 'wind disease'. Like Bìnào L.I.-14, Jiānyú L.I.-15 is also indicated for scrofula and goitre.

Finally, according to the Essential Questions16 Jiānyú L.I.-15 is one of the 'eight points for draining heat from the extremities' (although in fact only seven are listed) namely bilateral Yúnmén LU-2, bilateral Jiānyú L.I.-15, bilateral Wěizhōng BL-40 and Yāoshū DU-2.

Summary of clinical application
Primary point for all shoulder disorders: pain, weakness, winddamp painful obstruction, heat sensation, redness and swelling, inability to raise the arm to the head.
Important point for all disorders of the arm, especially hemiplegia, atrophy disorder and painful obstruction. Often combined with Quchi L.I.-11 and Hegu L.I.-4 in the ‘chain and lock’ point association method.
Eliminates wind in the form of urticaria, wind paralysis, windstroke, wind atrophy disorder etc.
