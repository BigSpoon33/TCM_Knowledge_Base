## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The name of this point (Siman) is translated as 'Four Fullnesses'. Although there are different interpretations of its meaning, one opinion is that it refers to the four kinds of stagnation and accumulation: qi, water, food and blood. There are clear indications that reflect each of these conditions, for example abdominal distention for qi, abdominal oedema for water, and diarrhoea or constipation for food, but overwhelmingly the indications reflect the presence of blood stasis, for example cutting pain below the umbilicus, retention of lochia, and malign blood with acute pain. The term 'malign blood' refers to blood that has left the vessels and which, bereft of the moving force of qi, pools and stagnates.

Summary of clinical application
Dispels the ‘four fullnesses’ i.e. accumulation and stagnation of qi (abdominal distention), water (abdominal oedema), food (diarrhoea or constipation), and especially blood (cutting pain below the umbilicus, retention of lochia, malign blood with acute pain).
