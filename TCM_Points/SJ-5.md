## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Wàiguān SJ-5, the confluent point of the Yang Linking vessel, is the most important and frequently used distal point of the Sanjiao channel with wide clinical application. The Yang Linking vessel, which has no points of its own, links the six yang channels and the Governing vessel. Yang corresponds to the exterior while yin corresponds to the interior, and the yang channels as a whole therefore relate more to the exterior portion of the body. According to the Classic of Difficulties 7 "when the Yang Linking vessel is diseased, there will be severe chills and fever", whilst the Song of Points for Miscellaneous Diseases says "use Wàiguān SJ-5 for all wind, cold, summer-heat and damp pathogens, headaches and fever". In the Ode of the Obstructed River the use of Wàiguān SJ-5 is referred to as one of the 'eight therapeutic methods'. In this description of the application of the eight confluent points of the extraordinary vessels to affect specific symptoms and areas of the body, Wàiguān SJ-5 is indicated for injury by cold to the exterior accompanied by headache. These classical references emphasise two of the principle applications of Wàiguān SJ-5 namely: i. dispelling exterior pathogenic factors, and ii. treating headache.

Exterior pathogenic factors attack the superficial portion of the body first, giving rise to the typical symptoms of chills and fever, and at this stage of progression the treatment principle is to release the exterior. In current clinical practice some authorities emphasise the special ability of Wàiguān SJ-5 to resolve wind-heat and Hégǔ L.I.-4 to resolve wind-cold, whilst others take the opposite view. This inevitably raises the question of when to use Wàiguān SJ-5 and when to use Hégǔ L.I.-4. Although there is no clear-cut answer, it is worth noting that whilst Hégǔ L.I.-4 is classically indicated for chills and fever accompanied by absence of sweating (characteristic of wind-cold), the only reference to sweating and Wàiguān SJ-5 in classical sources is 'sweating with heat on the exterior' (characteristic of wind-heat). Hégǔ L.I.-4 belongs to yangming channel which dominates the central portion of the face and is strongly indicated for pathogenic factors giving rise to sneezing and nasal discharge, whilst Wàiguān SJ-5 belongs to the Sanjiao channel which traverses the lateral portion of the neck and is indicated for swelling of the glands (including scrofula and mumps).

When wind-dampness attacks the body, in addition to chills and fever there is typically pain of the joints, and the Classic of the Jade Dragon recommends Wàiguān SJ-5 for 'chills and fever and pain of the hundred joints'. In terms of the four levels theory of febrile diseases, Wàiguān SJ-5 predominantly treats pathogens at the defensive and qi levels. In terms of the Sanjiao theory of differentiating fevers, it focuses on the more exterior upper jiao Lung pattern, rather than the Pericardium pattern. This is in contrast to points of its coupled Pericardium channel, which predominantly treat pathogens at the nutritive and blood levels according to four level theory, and the Pericardium pattern according to the Sanjiao theory.

As well as chills and fever, Wàiguān SJ-5 is indicated for either wind-cold or wind-heat attacking the eyes and ears and giving rise to symptoms such as redness, pain and swelling, lacrimation, deafness and tinnitus etc.

Wàiguān SJ-5 is classically indicated for many different kinds of headache, including temporal, vertex, frontal and occipital headaches as well as headache due to Kidney deficiency, head wind and 'thunder head wind' (severe headache with a thundering sound in the head). The widespread action of Wàiguān SJ-5 on such varied kinds of headache may be explained by a number of different factors: i. as stated above, Wàiguān SJ-5 is an important point to expel pathogenic factors and may be used in the treatment of headache due to penetration by wind-cold, wind-heat or wind-damp; ii. the Yang Linking vessel links all the yang channels (the occipital region is governed by the Governing vessel and taiyang channel, the temporal region by the Yang Linking vessel and shaoyang channel, and the frontal region by yangming channel); iii. the Sanjiao channel specifically connects with such important points for headaches as Běnshén GB-13 through to Fēngchí GB-20, Tóuwéi ST-8 and Fēngfǔ DU-16; iv. the Sanjiao and Gall Bladder shaoyang channels are linked according to six channel theory, and the Sanjiao channel intersects the Gall Bladder channel at points Tóngzǐliáo GB-1, Shàngguān GB-3, Hànyàn GB-4, Xuánlí GB-6 and Jiānjǐng GB-21, whilst the Gall Bladder and Liver channels are interiorly-exteriorly coupled. Wàiguān SJ-5 is therefore an especially important point in the treatment of headaches due to Liver disharmony, especially when this gives rise to one-sided temporal headache (shaoyang region). For this purpose Wàiguān SJ-5 is often combined with Gall Bladder channel points such as Zúlínqì GB-41 (predominantly for headaches due to Liver qi stagnation, including premenstrual headaches), and Yángfǔ GB-38 and Xiáxī GB-43 (predominantly for headaches due to Liver fire or Liver yang rising).

The Yang Linking vessel passes behind the ear whilst the Sanjiao channel both encircles and enters the ear. Wàiguān SJ-5 is therefore an important point in the treatment of various ear disorders including tinnitus, deafness, earache and itching of the ear, and along with Zhōngzhǔ SJ-3 is one of the principal distal points in the treatment of disorders of this region.

The Sanjiao channel belongs to fire and its internal pathway passes through all the three jiao. According to Methods of Acupuncture and Moxibustion from the Golden Mirror of Medicine Wàiguān SJ-5 resolves knotting of heat in the five zang and six fu. Its action on clearing heat from the middle and lower jiao is reflected in its ability to treat constipation, abdominal pain, pain of the lateral costal region and vomiting, but it is especially effective in treating heat disorders of the head (swelling and pain of the cheek, nosebleed, toothache, ulceration of the mouth, cracked lips etc.) and clearing heat and fire poison from the Sanjiao channel in the neck (scrofula and mumps).

Wàiguān SJ-5 is also a vital point in the treatment of a wide variety of channel disorders affecting the shoulder, arm, elbow, wrist, hand and fingers. In this respect it acts almost like a point of the hand yangming Large Intestine channel, and is often incorporated with Jiānyú L.I.-15, Qūchí L.I.-11 and Hégǔ L.I.-4 in the treatment of painful obstruction, atrophy disorder and hemiplegia of the upper limb. The action of Wàiguān SJ-5 on the elbow region is emphasised in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion which gives specific indications for excess and deficiency of the luo-connecting points. In the case of Wàiguān SJ-5 these are contraction of the elbow (excess) and flaccidity of the elbow (deficiency).

Finally, Wàiguān SJ-5 is the luo-connecting point of the Sanjiao channel from where the luo-connecting channel rises to converge with the Pericardium channel in the chest. Although this strengthens the Sanjiao-Pericardium relationship, with the exception of oppression and tightness of the chest there are no specific indications of this linkage. In clinical practice, however, the points Nèiguān P-6 and Wàiguān SJ-5 are often joined by through-needling for pain of the chest which radiates to the back.
