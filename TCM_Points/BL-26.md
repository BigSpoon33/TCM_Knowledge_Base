## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Guānyuánshú BL-26, due to its proximity to the fifth lumbar vertebra, is much used in the treatment of lumbar pain. Various classics of Chinese medicine have specified the use of this point in the treatment of 'wind-taxation' lumbar pain i.e. lumbar pain due to attack and injury by exterior pathogenic factors which lodge in the back and over time lead to deficiency. This is a common development of back pain due to painful obstruction and reflects the fact that not only can Kidney deficiency lead to weakness of the back and hence invasion of exterior pathogens, but also that prolonged retention of pathogenic factors, especially when the bones are injured, can weaken the Kidneys. Thus Standards of Patterns and Treatment47 said "[In back ache] wind, damp, cold, heat, sprain, blood stasis, stagnation of qi, accumulations are all the manifestation; the root is always Kidney deficiency", whilst the Essential Questions48 stated "In chronic bone painful obstruction where the pathogenic factor repeatedly attacks, it will reach and reside in the Kidneys". The action of Guānyuánshú BL-26 on lumbar pain however, is so valuable that in clinical practice it may be used for any pattern, not solely deficiency, and it is one of the points that should be palpated, and needled if tender, in all cases of backache.

The tonifying action of Guānyuánshú BL-26 is implied in its name 'Gate of Origin Shu'. It is further indicated for such deficiency disorders as wasting and thirsting disorder, deficiency distention, diarrhoea and various urinary disorders, all characterised by deficiency of the Kidneys.

Summary of clinical application
Commonly used for lumbar pain, and should be palpated, and needled if tender, in any case of lumbar pain. Especially indicated for ‘wind-taxation’ lumbar pain i.e. lumbar pain due to attack and injury by exterior pathogenic factors which lodge in the back and over time lead to deficiency.
Tonifies deficiency: deficiency distention, enuresis, frequent urination, wasting and thirsting disorder.
