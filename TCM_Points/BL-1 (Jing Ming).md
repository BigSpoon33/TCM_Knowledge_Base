## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Jīngmíng BL-1 (Bright Eyes) is the meeting point of all the yang channels (except the Large Intestine) and the Governing, Yang Motility and Yin Motility vessels. Although the pathology of eye diseases is complex and varied, they may be summarised as due to i. exterior pathogenic factors (mostly wind and heat), or ii. to deficiency or excess patterns of interior disharmony. Yang governs the exterior, and due both to its location and the fact that most of the yang channels meet at this point, Jīngmíng BL-1 is the primary local point for the treatment of virtually any eye disease of exterior origin. It was traditionally indicated for redness, swelling, pain, lacrimation, itching and blurred vision. Equally, Jīngmíng BL-1 is an essential local point for the treatment of eye diseases due to interior disharmony, whatever the pathology, and was traditionally indicated for night blindness, photophobia, blurred vision, visual dizziness etc., and in modern times for glaucoma, optic nerve atrophy, pterygium, astigmatism, optic neuritis, retinal haemorrhage and early cataract.

Summary of clinical application
Important local point for many different eye disorders including redness, swelling and pain of the eyes, lacrimation on exposure to wind, blurred vision, dimness of vision, night blindness, photophobia, colour blindness, near sightedness, glaucoma, optic nerve atrophy, pterygium, astigmatism, optic neuritis, retinal haemorrhage, early cataract.
