## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Shàozé SI-1 is the jing-well point of the Small Intestine channel. In common with all the jing-well points of the yang channels, it has a strong action on clearing heat from the opposite end of the channel in the head. Branches of the Small Intestine channel ascend to the ear, the inner and outer canthus, and alongside the nose, whilst its paired Heart channel opens into the tongue. Shàozé SI-1, therefore, has a strong effect on clearing heat or pathologically ascending yang from the eyes, ears, nose and tongue, as well as the mouth and throat, and is indicated for such excess disorders as red eyes, tinnitus and deafness, erosion and ulceration of the tongue, painful obstruction of the throat, mouth ulcers, drooling and nosebleed.

According to the Classic of Difficulties2 the jing-well points are indicated for fullness below the Heart. Whilst the region 'below the Heart' specifically refers to the upper epigastrium, like many of the jing-well points, Shàozé SI-1 treats fullness in the chest region as a whole and is indicated for oppression and pain of the chest and Heart, cold sensation below the Heart and pain of the lateral costal region.

In clinical practice however, Shàozé SI-1 is principally used for swelling and abscess of the breasts and disorders of lactation. Absence of lactation is primarily differentiated into two types, insufficiency of qi and blood resulting in inadequate production of milk, or stagnation of Liver qi which leads to obstruction and coagulation of milk in the breasts. The Small Intestine primary channel descends to the centre of the chest at Shānzhōng REN-17, and these two points are frequently combined to treat insufficiency or total absence of lactation. Breast abscess is usually due to Liver or Stomach fire or transformation of exterior pathogens to heat. In combination with suitable points, Shàozé SI-1 may be used in any of these two patterns.

Finally, in common with the other jing-well points, Shàozé SI-1 is used to revive consciousness and is indicated for loss of consciousness from windstroke.

Summary of clinical application
Clears heat from the upper portion of the channel: headache, dizziness, superficial visual obstruction, red eyes, nosebleed, deafness, tinnitus, throat painful obstruction, curled tongue, stiff tongue, heat in the mouth, erosion of the mouth, mouth ulcers, drooling.
As the jing-well point restores consciousness and treats disorders of the chest: loss of consciousness from windstroke, cold sensation below the Heart, Heart pain, oppression and pain of the chest, pain of the lateral costal region, cough.
Most commonly used clinically for swelling of the breast, breast abscess and absence of lactation (often with Shanzhong REN-17).
