## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

G√©sh≈´ BL-17 is the hui-meeting point of blood and, as its name 'Diaphragm Shu' implies, is a kind of honorary back-shu point of the diaphragm, although it is not generally listed as such. These two properties inform its principal actions.

G√©sh≈´ BL-17 has long been considered a vital point in the treatment of the widest range of blood disorders, indeed many classics simply state that this point can be used for "all blood diseases". Although varied and complex in presentation, disorders of blood may be generalised as being of three main types: blood stasis, blood heat and blood deficiency.

Impairment of blood circulation and consequent blood stasis may be due to stagnation or deficiency of qi, traumatic injury, haemorrhage, penetration of cold, blood deficiency, heat, chronic disease or emotional factors. The variety of symptoms which blood stasis can give rise to is extensive, but of these the principal one is pain. Pain of excess type may be due either to stagnation of qi or stasis of blood, as reflected in the famous adage "without movement there is pain, with movement there is no pain". Pain due to qi stagnation is characterised by a tendency to move and fluctuate, whilst pain due to blood stasis is fixed and stabbing. According to Wang Qing-ren, the Qing dynasty author of Correcting Errors in Medicine "whenever there is pain in the abdomen that does not move, it is blood stasis". Tang Rong-chuan in the Treatise on Disorders of Blood said "... When blood stasis is between the jingluo and the zangfu the whole body is in pain ... when it is in the upper jiao ... there is stabbing obstinate pain of the arm, chest and diaphragm ... when it is in the middle jiao there is pain of the abdomen and lateral costal region". As is clear from its indications, G√©sh≈´ BL-17 is applicable in all these cases. It should be noted, however, that due to its location and its special action on the diaphragm which intersects the upper and middle jiao, its main sphere of action is on these two areas and it is less used for blood stasis in the lower jiao. G√©sh≈´ BL-17 is also an important point to treat various kinds of fever due to blood stasis. The Treatise on Disorders of Blood states "when blood stasis is at the level of the pores, the nutritive qi and defensive qi are not harmonised, there is fever accompanied by chills ... when it is half-interior half-exterior ... there is alternating chills and fever ... when it is at the level of the muscles and flesh there will be a burning fever ... when it is in the jingluo and zangfu ... there is necessarily steaming bone consumption fever". Finally, according to Wang Qing-ren in Correcting Errors in Medicine "In the pattern of mania-depression, where there is continual crying and laughing, swearing and singing ... then the qi and blood will coagulate in the brain, the qi of the zangfu are disconnected, [the patient] will be as if in a dream". This quotation emphasises the relationship of blood stasis to severe psycho-emotional disorders. Although Wang Qing-ren ascribes the site of the disease to the brain, as discussed elsewhere (see the introductory discussion preceding the Governing vessel points) there is an overlap between the Heart and brain in the various traditions of Chinese medicine. Whatever the location of the disorder, however, the pathology is similar. Blood stasis may directly disturb the spirit, or alternatively blood stasis may both obstruct the blood vessels and transform to heat. The heat agitates the spirit whilst the blood stasis prevents nourishment by fresh blood from reaching the Heart and brain. The combination of heat and Heart blood deficiency leads to a malnourished and restless spirit.

G√©sh≈´ BL-17 is an important point for many kinds of bleeding disorders, primarily due to blood heat or blood stasis, including coughing blood, vomiting blood, spitting blood, nosebleed and blood in the stool. Heat entering the blood level may be due to a number of causes including constitutional heat, exterior pathogenic heat, overconsumption of excessively heating food or drink, or heat of excess or deficiency type generated by disharmony of the zangfu. When heat agitates the blood it causes it to move recklessly and burst out of the vessels giving rise to haemorrhage that is usually acute and profuse. G√©sh≈´ BL-17 is able to cool the blood and stop bleeding, primarily from the upper and middle jiao (Lung and Stomach). Another important cause of haemorrhage is blood stasis. When blood is stagnant and does not move, it accumulates and may be forced out of the vessels, giving rise to haemorrhage characterised by its intermittent nature, dark purplish colour and presence of clots. At the same time, haemorrhage due to any aetiology is itself an important cause of blood stasis, as blood that is forced out of the vessels easily pools and stagnates. This is reflected in the saying "where there is haemorrhage there is stasis". The close inter-relationship of blood heat, blood stasis and haemorrhage is further illustrated by the fact that blood heat may condense and dry the blood giving rise to stasis, as stated in the Treatise on Epidemic Warm Febrile Disease19 "Because latent stagnant fire evaporates the blood's fluid, the blood simmers and forms stasis".

The ability of G√©sh≈´ BL-17 to nourish blood (and yin) is clearly overshadowed in the classical indications by its ability to resolve blood stasis and heat. There are three areas, however, that reflect its nourishing and tonifying properties. The first is its ability to treat disorders such as night sweating and steaming bone disorder due to severe blood and yin deficiency. The second is the combination of G√©sh≈´ BL-17 with D«énsh≈´ BL-19 known as the 'four flowers'. The four flowers were first mentioned in Secrets of a Frontier Official by Wang Tao in 752 CE, who did not specify the points but described rather a complex location method. He advised tying a piece of string around the neck, with a knot made at the level of Ji≈´w√©i REN-15. When the string is allowed to fall down the back, the knot will then lie on the vertebral column at the crossing point of two diagonal lines the end of each of which leads to one of the four points.

The Classic of Supplementing Life with Acupuncture and Moxibustion in the 13th century first defined the four flowers by name as G√©sh≈´ BL-17 and D«énsh≈´ BL-19 and said that they dominated blood, being indicated (for treatment by moxibustion) for taxation consumption disorder. The third application of the blood nourishing property of G√©sh≈´ BL-17 is its special ability to treat blood deficiency allied to blood stasis. It has long been understood that following haemorrhage, the consequent blood stasis prevents the formation of new blood. This is reflected in the saying "if blood stasis is not transformed, new blood cannot be generated", and the statement by Tang Rong-chuan in the Treatise on Disorders of Blood "In vomiting blood, nosebleeds and blood in the stool, the blood leaves the channels; any blood that has left the channels is separated and no longer connected with the blood that nourishes the entire body ... this blood is unable to augment with good blood, thus the transformation of new blood is hindered". Thus, by pooling outside the channels, blood stasis may lead directly to blood deficiency as sufficient blood is no longer available to nourish the body.

The action of G√©sh≈´ BL-17 on painful obstruction (commonly referred to as wind-damp in Chinese medicine) which affects the whole body, reflects its action of regulating blood. Prolonged painful obstruction may give rise either to blood stasis or blood deficiency, whilst blood deficiency may render a person prone to invasion by wind-damp. The importance of treating the blood in such cases is reflected in the saying "to treat wind first treat the blood; once blood moves wind will be dispelled".

As its name 'Diaphragm Shu' implies, G√©sh≈´ BL-17 has an important action on the diaphragm which lies between the upper and middle jiao. By harmonising the diaphragm, G√©sh≈´ BL-17 is able to descend rebellious qi of both the Lung in the upper jiao (cough and dyspnoea) and the Stomach in the middle jiao (vomiting, Stomach reflux, hiccup and difficult ingestion). G√©sh≈´ BL-17 is specifically indicated for oesophageal constriction characterised by difficulty in swallowing and, in the latter stages, by vomiting in the evening what was ingested in the morning, and vomiting in the morning what was ingested the evening before.

Finally, due to its action on the diaphragm and Stomach, and by extension the Spleen, G√©sh≈´ BL-17 is indicated for various kinds of retained fluid giving rise to symptoms such as heaviness, swelling, distention and pain of the body, weariness of the four limbs, somnolence and cold phlegm of the diaphragm and Stomach.

Summary of clinical application
Important point for blood stasis and bleeding anywhere in the body: oppression of the chest, stabbing pain of the Heart, coughing blood, vomiting blood, spitting blood, nosebleed, blood in the stool, "all blood diseases", urticaria, painful obstruction of the whole body, pain of the whole body, pain of the skin, flesh and bones, mania-depression.
Regulates the middle jiao: epigastric pain, fullness of the abdomen and lateral costal region, vomiting, hiccup, oesophageal constriction, difficult ingestion, Stomach reflux, inability to eat.
Comprises the ‚Äòfour flowers‚Äô with D«énsh≈´ BL-19 to tonify deficiency and treat fevers: dizziness, weariness of the four limbs, lethargy with no desire to move, somnolence, tidal fever, night sweating, steaming bone disorder, spontaneous sweating, fever without sweating, aversion to cold.
