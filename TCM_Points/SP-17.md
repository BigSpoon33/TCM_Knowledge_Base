## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Shídòu SP-17 is also known by the alternative name of Mingguan (Gate of Life). According to the Book of Bian Que's Secrets Shídòu SP-17 "connects the real Spleen qi and cures thirty-six kinds of Spleen disease. In severe disease, when life is hanging by a thread, moxibustion at this point with 200-300 moxa cones will assure the patient's survival. Use this point in any major Spleen disease"20. Despite this inspiring quotation, there are few references to this kind of application or combinations which include the point, in other classical texts, and Shídòu SP-17 is mainly indicated for pain of the lateral costal region, distention and pain of the abdomen and diaphragm with belching, vomiting and indigested food in the stool, all clear indications of food stagnation.
