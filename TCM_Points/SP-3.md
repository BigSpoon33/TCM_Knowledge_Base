## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

T√†ib√°i SP-3 is the shu-stream, yuan-source and earth point of the Spleen earth channel, and has a powerful action on strengthening and regulating the qi of the Spleen and Stomach. The Spiritual Pivot in Chapter 6 recommends the use of the shu-stream points in the treatment of disorders of the zang, whilst in Chapter 1 it says "When the five zang are diseased, select [from] the twelve yuan-source [points]". The Classic of the Jade Dragon clearly states that T√†ib√°i SP-3 is indicated for "deficiency and feebleness of the Spleen and Stomach". Since deficiency of these zangfu easily leads to excess dampness and consequent obstruction of qi, T√†ib√°i SP-3 is an important point for treating both the primary deficiency and the subsequent excess that is often generated.

The Essential Questions4 states "Damp, swelling and fullness all pertain to the Spleen" and "When the Spleen is diseased, damp is generated". The Stomach and Spleen together dominate the transformation of both the solid and liquid parts of food and drink, and the transportation throughout the body of the qi and body fluids transformed from them. When the Stomach and Spleen are deficient these functions of transportation and transformation are impaired, leading to the accumulation of dampness. T√†ib√°i SP-3 is indicated for a range of symptoms reflecting this combination of deficiency and excess such as borborygmus and diarrhoea, undigested food in the stool, heaviness of the body, oppressive sensation of the four limbs etc. Although Spleen deficiency most commonly gives rise to diarrhoea and loose stools, T√†ib√°i SP-3 is included in several classical combinations for constipation and difficult defecation. This kind of constipation may arise when there is insufficient qi to move and activate the bowels.

Exterior dampness or damp-heat, which most easily penetrate when there is underlying Spleen deficiency or interior dampness, may injure the body in three main ways, for all of which T√†ib√°i SP-3 is indicated. Firstly they may combine with wind-cold or wind-heat, giving rise to symptoms such as febrile disease with fullness and oppression and inability to lie down, and febrile disease that begins with heaviness of the head. Secondly, they may directly attack the Spleen and Stomach giving rise to symptoms such as dysenteric disorder, diarrhoea containing pus and blood, vomiting, and heat in the body with agitation and fullness. Thirdly, in the form of wind-damp, they may enter the channels and give rise to painful obstruction manifesting as heaviness of the body with pain of the bones, joint pains, pain of the knee and thigh or lumbar pain. The use of T√†ib√°i SP-3 in this latter pattern reflects the statement in the Classic of Difficulties5 that shu-stream points are indicated for "heaviness of the body and pain of the joints". In addition to treating these patterns of exterior dampness, T√†ib√°i SP-3 may also be used for leg qi due to damp-heat pouring downwards, and atrophy disorder due either to dampness or to Spleen deficiency. This pattern is discussed in the Essential Questions which says "With exposure to dampness over a period of time, the muscles and flesh will be invaded; this will lead to insensitivity and flesh atrophy"6 and "When there is illness in the Spleen it fails to transport body fluids for the Stomach. The four limbs do not receive the nourishment of water and grain and therefore become weak. There is no free flow through the vessel-pathways and there is no qi to engender the sinews, bones and muscles which therefore cannot function"7.

It should be noted that T√†ib√°i SP-3 is also strongly indicated for various symptoms characterised by distention and pain in the abdomen, epigastrium, chest, Heart and lateral costal region. These are due to stagnation of qi which may arise either due to qi deficiency, in other words when there is insufficient qi to maintain smooth circulation, or when accumulation of turbid dampness obstructs the smooth movement of qi. In the former case the pulse and tongue will reflect deficiency only and the treatment principle is to reinforce T√†ib√°i SP-3, according to the theory of 'treating by opposition', in this case 'to treat fullness by filling'. In the latter case the pulse and tongue will show signs of excess and the treatment principle is to reduce T√†ib√°i SP-3.

Finally, T√†ib√°i SP-3 is frequently used for disorders of the joints of the big toe and the head of the first metatarsal bone.
