## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Dúbí ST-35, located in the lateral visible hollow below the patella, is an essential point in the treatment of all knee disorders, whether due to deficiency or excess, heat or cold. In clinical practice it is frequently combined with the extra point medial Xiyan (located in the medial visible hollow below the patella), and is therefore most often known as lateral Xiyan.

Summary of clinical application
Important local point (often in combination with medial Xiyan) for the treatment of knee disorders: swelling and pain, difficulty in flexing and extending, weakness, numbness etc.
