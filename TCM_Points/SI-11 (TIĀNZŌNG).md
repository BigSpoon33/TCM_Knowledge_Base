## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The indications of Tiānzōng SI-11 reflect both its location and its ability to move qi and unbind the chest. It is an important point for pain of the scapular region whether due to sprain, painful obstruction, overuse, poor posture, Liver qi stagnation or referred pain from Gall Bladder disease, in which cases it is usually found to be acutely tender on palpation. Lying behind the breast, it is also used in combination with points such as Shàozé SI-1 and Shānzhōng REN-17 for a wide variety of disorders of the breast including pain, lumps and insufficient lactation.

Summary of clinical application
Commonly used local point for any pain of the scapular region (whether due to sprain, painful obstruction, overuse, poor posture, Liver qi stagnation or referred pain from Gall Bladder disease).
For breast disorders including pain, lumps and insufficient lactation.
