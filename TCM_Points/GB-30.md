  location_description: On the postero-lateral aspect of the hip joint, one third
    of the distance between the prominence of the greater trochanter and the sacro-coccygeal
    hiatus (Yāoshū DU-2).
  location_notes: i. This point may most readily be located (and needled) with the
    patient lying on their side; ii. To accurately palpate the prominence of the greater
    trochanter place one hand over the lateral aspect of the hip joint at the level
    of the perineum, and with the other hand rotate the foot in order to feel the
    movement of the prominence of the greater trochanter; iii. The sacro-coccygeal
    hiatus is located in-between the cornua of the sacrum and coccyx, in the depression
    inferior to the fourth sacral spinous process if this is palpable. Note, however,
    that the sacro-coccygeal hiatus may sometimes extend as high as the level of the
    third sacral foramina.

## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Huántiào GB-30 was included by Ma Dan-yang, the great physician of the Jin dynasty, among the 'eleven heavenly star points'9, his grouping of the most vital acupuncture points, and was indicated by him for " ... cold wind and damp painful obstruction, pain radiating from the hip to the calf, sighing with pain when turning over". Huántiào GB-30 is unrivalled in importance for the treatment of disorders of the hip joint and buttock, whether due to traumatic injury, painful obstruction, stagnation of qi or deficiency.

Huántiào GB-30 is located at the pivotal hip region, the gate of the lower limb, and as its name 'Jumping Circle' implies, is able to influence the movement of the whole lower limb. It is a vital point to promote circulation of qi and blood in the treatment of all kinds of painful obstruction, atrophy disorder, numbness, stiffness, pain and contraction of the leg. In the treatment of sciatica, it is considered by many practitioners to be the single most important point which may be used whatever the nature and distribution of the pain. Its importance in the treatment of painful obstruction of the lower extremities was emphasised in the Secrets of the Heavenly Star which asked "Cold wind damp painful obstruction, where do you needle? First choose Huántiào GB-30, then Yánglíngquán GB-34". Its ability to promote circulation throughout the leg also renders it an essential point in the treatment of hemiplegia with an action similar to points of the yangming Stomach channel.

The Bladder channel unites with the Gall Bladder channel at this point, and Huántiào GB-30 can therefore also treat disorders of the lumbar region (through which the Bladder channel courses), whether extending to the hip and buttock, or radiating upwards along the Gall Bladder channel to the lateral costal region.

Finally Huántiào GB-30 is cited in the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc.

Summary of clinical application
Essential point for sciatica and for all disorders of the leg: painful obstruction, atrophy disorder, numbness, stiffness, pain and contraction.
Essential local point for disorders of the hip joint; also for when pain radiates from the hip to the lumbar or lateral costal regions.
