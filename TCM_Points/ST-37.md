## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic stated "The Large and Small intestines fall under the influence of the Stomach"34 and classified Shàngjùxū ST-37 as the lower he-sea point of the Large Intestine. The three yang channels of the arm (Large Intestine, Small Intestine and Sanjiao) are unique in that whilst the channels traverse the upper jiao, their respective fu belong to the lower jiao. Thus although the Spiritual Pivot states that the "He-sea points treat disorders of the internal fu", the he-sea points of these three channels (Qūchí L.I.-11, Xiǎohǎi SI-8, and Tiānjǐng SJ-10 respectively) have relatively little action on their related fu. The Large and Small Intestines and the Sanjiao, however, each have a lower he-sea point (Shàngjùxū ST-37, Xiàjùxū ST-39 and Wěiyáng BL-39) which predominantly treat disorders of their respective fu.

Shàngjùxū ST-37 is an important point in the treatment of a wide range of intestinal disorders. It is especially effective in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysenteric disorder, whether due to deficiency, cold, dampness, or damp-heat, and in recent times has been much used in the treatment of bacillary dysentery. Shàngjùxū ST-37 is also used in the treatment of stagnation and obstruction of the intestines, giving rise to distention and pain of the abdomen, constipation and intestinal abscess. This comprehensive ability of Shàngjùxū ST-37 to regulate the intestines was referred to in the earliest classics. For example, the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion recommends Shàngjùxū ST-37 for "heat in the Large Intestine, diarrhoea containing undigested food and borborygmus", whilst the tenth century classic Sagelike Prescriptions from the Taiping Era recommends it for insufficiency of Large Intestine qi.

Some classics ascribe qi tonifying actions to this point, for example "deficiency and weakness of Spleen and Stomach, insufficiency of zang qi, shortness of breath etc." These may be explained by the beneficial effect that firming the intestines in cases of loose stool and diarrhoea will have on the transportation and transformation function of the Spleen. It is also worth noting that acupuncture points immediately distal or proximal to very powerful points, often share some of their functions and indications. It is as though the influence of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 is so great that it can resonate onto Shàngjùxū ST-37.

According to the Spiritual Pivot35 Shàngjùxū ST-37 is a point of the 'sea of blood'. This passage says "The Penetrating vessel is the sea of the twelve channels (i.e. the sea of blood). In the upper it is conveyed to Dàzhù BL-11, and in the lower it emerges at both Shàngjùxū ST-37 and Xiàjùxū ST-39 ... When the sea of blood is in excess, there is a sensation as if the body were big; one feels disquiet, but does not know what disease there is; when the sea of blood is insufficient, one has the sensation of one's body being small; one feels reduced but does not know what could be the illness". Despite this passage it is worth noting that such indications are not found in later texts.

In common with many points of the Stomach channel, Shàngjùxū ST-37 is especially effective in treating disorders of the lower limb as a whole. This action is explained by the saying "Yangming channels are abundant in qi and blood". The ability of Shàngjùxū ST-37 to promote the flow of smooth qi and blood throughout the leg renders it effective in the treatment of hemiplegia, leg qi, weakness of the leg, swelling of the knee and all kinds of atrophy disorder and painful obstruction, whether due to excess or deficiency patterns.

Finally, the Essential Questions36 includes Shàngjùxū ST-37 among the eight points to clear heat from the Stomach (bilateral Qìchōng ST-30, Zúsānlǐ ST-36, Shàngjùxū ST-37 and Xiàjùxū ST-39).
