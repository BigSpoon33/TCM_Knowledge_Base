## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the Classic of Difficulties9 "The Sanjiao is the pathway of water and grain". The Sanjiao therefore is the passageway for food and fluids throughout the body. When fluids stagnate and condense, whether due to stagnation of Liver qi, the condensing action of heat on the body fluids, or deficiency of any of the three zang responsible for fluid transformation and transportation (the Lung in the upper jiao, the Spleen in the middle jiao and the Kidneys in the lower jiao), phlegm will be generated. TiƒÅnj«êng SJ-10, the he-sea and earth point of the Sanjiao channel, has an important action on transforming phlegm and is indicated for a variety of phlegm patterns including scrofula, coughing of phlegm and psycho-emotional disorders.

The disease known as scrofula, in which nodules appear on the side of the neck or in the axilla, always involves phlegm combined either with stagnant qi or heat. TiƒÅnj«êng SJ-10 is traditionally indicated and included in various classical combinations for the treatment of this disease.

According to the Classic of Difficulties10 he-sea points are indicated for 'counterflow qi'. The Sanjiao channel enters the chest at ShƒÅnzh≈çng REN-17, and TiƒÅnj«êng SJ-10, the he-sea point of the Sanjiao channel, is able to regulate rebellious qi and transform phlegm in the treatment of such disorders as coughing of phlegm, chest painful obstruction with Heart pain, and coughing and vomiting of pus and blood.

As a consequence of its action on transforming phlegm, and the coupled relationship of the Sanjiao and Pericardium channels, TiƒÅnj«êng SJ-10 is also important in the treatment of disturbance of the Heart and spirit by phlegm or phlegm-heat. It is indicated in such disorders as epilepsy, madness, propensity to fright, fright palpitations, sadness and somnolence.

Like many points of the Sanjiao channel, TiƒÅnj«êng SJ-10 is able to clear heat from and invigorate the qi in the upper part of the channel and is indicated for one-sided headache, deafness, swelling and pain of the cheek, obstructed throat, throat painful obstruction with sweating, eye pain etc.

Like W√†iguƒÅn SJ-5 and Zhƒ´g≈çu SJ-6, the action of TiƒÅnj«êng SJ-10 extends throughout the three jiao. As well as treating the head, neck, Lung and Heart in the upper jiao, it is indicated for pain of the lateral costal region in the middle jiao, and haemorrhoids and distention and pain of the abdomen in the lower jiao.

In modern clinical practice the principal application of TiƒÅnj«êng SJ-10 is in the treatment of pain, painful obstruction and atrophy disorder affecting the elbow, arm, shoulder, neck and upper back. There are also clear references in classical sources to its use in the treatment of wind painful obstruction affecting the entire body. This action of resolving painful obstruction is shared to a lesser extent by the two following points on this channel, Q«ênglƒõngyuƒÅn SJ-11 and XiƒÅolu√≤ SJ-12.

Summary of clinical application
Transforms phlegm: scrofula (neck or axillary nodules), coughing phlegm, chest painful obstruction with Heart pain, psycho-emotional disorders (epilepsy, madness, sadness, propensity to fright, fright palpitations and somnolence).
Descends rebellious qi: coughing, coughing and vomiting of pus and blood.
Clears heat from the Sanjiao channel (one-sided headache, deafness, swelling and pain of the cheek, obstructed throat, throat painful obstruction with sweating, eye pain).
Treats painful obstruction and atrophy disorder affecting the elbow, arm, shoulder, neck and upper back.
