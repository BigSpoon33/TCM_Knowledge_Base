## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The name of this point 'Guilai' (Return) is normally understood to refer to its ability to restore the condition of the uterus and genitals to normal.

According to the Essential Questions15 "qi and blood desire warmth and dislike cold; when [there is] cold they coagulate; when [there is] warmth they disperse and flow". The Spiritual Pivot16 states "The blood [vessels], nutritive and defensive [qi] of man circulate without stopping, in the same way that the stars do in the upper region and the rivers in the lower region. When a cold pathogen comes to reside in the channels as a guest, the blood will coagulate; when the blood coagulates the channels do not move".

The over-riding action of Guīlái ST-29 is to warm the lower jiao, most particularly the uterus in women and the genital region in both men and women. Cold may be excess or deficient in nature. As far as excess cold is concerned, the uterus (along with the Stomach, Spleen and intestines) belongs to that group of the zangfu or extra fu that can suffer from direct penetration by exterior pathogenic cold (i.e. without initial symptoms and signs of an exterior pattern such as chills and fever, body aches etc.). Injury of the uterus by cold may be due to inadequate clothing or sitting on cold ground, or over-consumption of cold foods and drinks, especially during menstruation or after childbirth. Pathogenic cold causes stagnation of qi and coagulation of blood in the uterus and disrupts the function of the Conception and Penetrating vessels, giving rise to disorders such as amenorrhoea, irregular menstruation, uterine masses etc. Guīlái ST-29 is one of the primary points to warm the uterus and drive out pathogenic cold.

As far as deficiency cold is concerned, Guīlái ST-29 is also an important point for treating disorders due to decline of Kidney yang which generates cold, giving rise to irregular menstruation, amenorrhoea, infertility etc. The ability of Guīlái ST-29 to treat such disorders derives from its action of warming and benefiting the uterus rather than by directly tonifying Kidney yang. Guīlái ST-29 is also indicated for running piglet qi which may arise when Kidney yang deficiency leads to accumulation of cold in the lower jiao (see Qìchōng ST-30).

Amenorrhoea may be due to either excess or deficient patterns (stagnation of qi and stasis of blood, pathogenic cold, phlegm stagnation, blood deficiency, Kidney deficiency or heat pathogen which consumes yin blood). Due to its action of 'returning' the menstruation,Guīlái ST-29 is commonly used in the treatment of amenorrhoea due to any of these patterns.

The genital region in both men and women is equally susceptible to attack by pathogenic cold, giving rise to a variety of symptoms characterised by pain and retraction of the testicles, penis or vagina. As well as being able to warm and scatter excess cold in this region, Guīlái ST-29can firm and warm the lower jiao and is used in the treatment of disorders such as impotence, seminal emission, leucorrhoea and nocturnal urination due to decline of ming men fire.

Although the clinical manifestations will be somewhat different in each of the above situations, most will be characterised by aversion to cold and preference for and amelioration with heat. Since Guīlái ST-29 is mainly indicated for cold patterns it is particularly suited to treatment by combined needling and moxibustion.

Summary of clinical application
Warms and regulates the uterus and menstruation: amenorrhoea, irregular menstruation, uterine masses due to cold, uterine prolapse, coldness and pain and swelling of the vagina, infertility, leucorrhoea.
Warms and benefits the genitals: retraction of the testicles, impotence, pain of the penis, seminal emission, shan disorder.
