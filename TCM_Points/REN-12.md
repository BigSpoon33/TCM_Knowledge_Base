## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Zh≈çngw«én REN-12 (Middle Cavity), also known as Zhongguan (Middle Controller), is the front-mu point of the Stomach and the hui-meeting point of the fu. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers on the anterior surface of the body. As the origin of the post-heaven qi, the Stomach and Spleen are considered to play a central role among the zangfu, transforming and distributing the essence of food and drink throughout the body. For this reason, the Stomach may be said to dominate the fu and the Spleen the zang. The close relationship of Zh≈çngw«én REN-12 to the Stomach, therefore, is further reflected in its status as the hui-meeting point of the fu, in the same way that ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13, the front-mu point of the Spleen, is also the hui-meeting point of the zang.

Zh≈çngw«én REN-12 is the principal point on the abdomen to regulate the function of the Stomach. The Investigation into Points Along the Channels simply states that Zh≈çngw«én REN-12 can treat "all diseases of the Stomach and Spleen". In comparison with neighbouring points such as Li√°ngm√©n ST-21, Sh√†ngw«én REN-13 and Xi√†w«én REN-10 which are predominantly indicated in excess patterns, Zh≈çngw«én REN-12 is equally applicable in disorders characterised by either excess or deficiency.

The Stomach is the 'sea of water and grain' and its principal functions are to receive food and drink, 'rot and ripen' them and then descend these transformed products. Disorders of the Stomach may be deficient or excess in nature, due to cold or heat, exterior pathogens or interior disharmony. Whatever the aetiology, disharmony of the Stomach will always manifest in disturbance of one or more of these functions. If the Stomach fails to receive food and drink, there will be inability to eat and difficult ingestion; if the Stomach fails to 'rot and ripen' and to descend there will be fullness, distention and pain; if the Stomach qi rebels upwards there will be nausea, vomiting, Stomach reflux and hiccup.

Traditional Chinese methods of health preservation have long recognised the importance of emotional harmony in the smooth functioning of the Stomach. The constant dissipation of qi resulting from worry, anxiety and overthinking may deplete the Stomach and Spleen and impair the function of the Stomach. Excess of any of the seven emotions may result in stagnation of qi which then injures the Stomach leading to epigastric pain. Most injurious of all the emotions are anger, frustration or resentment, particularly if experienced whilst eating. At this time the qi is focused on the Stomach, rendering it particularly susceptible to qi stagnation. In all these cases Zh≈çngw«én REN-12 is a primary point. In practice, epigastric pain or distention deriving from Liver qi stagnation may be accompanied by pain or distention of the lateral costal region. Not only is Zh≈çngw«én REN-12 indicated for this symptom, but the needling sensation from Zh≈çngw«én REN-12 commonly transmits to this area.

The Stomach and Spleen are intimately related. According to the Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach by Li Dong-yuan "when Stomach deficiency gives rise to failure of the taiyin to receive [what is naturally due it], the foot yangming mu point [ Zh≈çngw«én REN-12] will lead it through". This highlights the important secondary action of Zh≈çngw«én REN-12 in strengthening the Spleen in cases of deficiency. It is indicated for diarrhoea, undigested food (in the stool), deficiency-taxation, post-partum dizziness and sallow complexion.

Finally Zh≈çngw«én REN-12 is cited in the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc.
