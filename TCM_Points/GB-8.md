## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Shu√†ig«î GB-8 is an important point for treating parietal or temporal headache and heaviness, especially when unilateral, and is frequently found to be tender in such cases. The Gall Bladder primary and sinew channels traverse the side of the head, and the Gall Bladder channel is interiorly-exteriorly related to the Liver channel. Shu√†ig«î GB-8 is particularly indicated in cases where exterior wind attacks the head, or Liver fire, Liver yang or Liver wind ascend along the Gall Bladder channel to harass the head causing severe one-sided headache.

According to the Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man Shu√†ig«î GB-8 is especially indicated for "cold and phlegm in the diaphragm and Stomach, injury by alcohol, wind giving rise to severe and stubborn pain at both corners of the brain, inability to eat and drink, agitation and fullness with ceaseless vomiting". This is a clear reference to migrainous headache. Since Shu√†ig«î GB-8 harmonises the diaphragm and Stomach, it is the main point on the head to treat headache accompanied by vomiting due to attack on the Stomach by Liver qi, or to Gall Bladder and Stomach phlegm-heat. Alcohol may induce migraine headache and vomiting by aggravating Liver heat and disrupting the harmony between the Liver and the Stomach, or by inducing or aggravating damp-heat in the Gall Bladder and Stomach. Many classics therefore recommend this point for headache and vomiting induced by alcohol.

Shu√†ig«î GB-8 is also indicated for accumulation of phlegm in the diaphragm and Stomach, giving rise to ceaseless vomiting and 'phlegm qi diaphragm pain'. In clinical practice the pattern of phlegm or phlegm-heat in the Stomach is commonly seen in combination with Gall Bladder stagnation and heat. Shu√†ig«î GB-8 is especially indicated when these symptoms are accompanied by one-sided headache.

Summary of clinical application
Important point for parietal or temporal headache and heaviness, especially when one-sided and due to exterior wind, Liver fire, Liver yang or Liver wind.
Important for migrainous headaches accompanied by nausea and vomiting and induced by alcohol.
Also for accumulation of phlegm in the diaphragm and Stomach, giving rise to ceaseless vomiting and pain of the diaphragm.
