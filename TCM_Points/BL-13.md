## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Fèishū BL-13 is the back-shu point of the Lung, where the qi of the Lung emanates from the interior to the body surface, and in common with all the back-shu points, especially those of the yin zang, has a strong action on regulating and tonifying its corresponding zangfu at the deepest level. Fèishū BL-13 is the pre-eminent acupuncture point to treat all disorders of the Lung zang.

Fèishū BL-13 is an essential point to tonify the Lung qi and nourish Lung yin. Lung qi deficiency may derive from constitutional deficiency, previous Lung disease, chronic illness, extreme sadness and grief, excessive desk work (especially with a hunched back), excessive physical labour or lack of exercise. It is characterised by symptoms such as weak cough, dyspnoea and asthma that are worsened by exertion, and shortness of breath with no desire to speak. According to a saying of Chinese medicine "The Lung is the gateway of the voice". When there is insufficiency of Lung qi therefore, there is lack of vigour in the voice, speaking readily tires a person and there is unwillingness to speak. According to the Essential Questions9 "All qi is subordinate to the Lung". Since the Lung dominates the qi of the whole body, there may also be signs of general qi deficiency such as lassitude, facial pallor and a weak pulse. In such cases Fèishū BL-13 is often combined with points such as Tàiyuān LU-9, Shānzhōng REN-17, Zúsānlǐ ST-36 and Píshū BL-20. In cases of chronic Lung qi deficiency giving rise to asthma or cough that is worse in winter, intensive moxibustion is often applied to Fèishū BL-13 in the summer months.

Lung yin deficiency may derive from prolonged Lung qi deficiency, overwork, febrile disease which consumes yin, or Kidney yin deficiency which fails to nourish and support Lung yin. It is characterised by cough or asthma with dry, stringy or blood-tinged sputum, night sweating and dryness of the mouth, throat and tongue. In more severe cases there may be tidal fever, steaming bone disorder, deficiency agitation and spitting of blood. In such cases Fèishū BL-13 is often combined with points such as Gāohuāngshū BL-43, Tàiyuān LU-9, Guānyuán REN-4 and Shènshū BL-23.

Fèishū BL-13 is also classically indicated for Lung atrophy and consumption, both terms denoting conditions of severe exhaustion and depletion. In Lung atrophy, the Lungs are said to wither and shrivel, in the same way that the limbs are seen to wither and shrivel in atrophy disorder, whilst consumption broadly corresponds to pulmonary tuberculosis.

The action of Fèishū BL-13 is not restricted to tonifying and nourishing the Lung however, and it is equally important in all excess Lung patterns. Through its actions of regulating Lung qi and clearing heat, it may be used for such patterns as i. excess heat afflicting the Lung, ii. retention of phlegm-damp or phlegm-heat, and iii. toxic heat obstructing the Lung. It is consequently indicated for fullness of the chest, chest pain, Lung abscess, coughing of phlegm and difficult breathing on lying down. In such cases, in addition to other appropriate points, Fèishū BL-13 is often combined with Zhōngfǔ LU-1, an example of the principle of combining the back-shu and front-mu points.

Fèishū BL-13 is also an important point for the treatment of pathogenic factors lodging at the defensive (or taiyang) level. Combined with points such as Fēngmén BL-12, Lièquē LU-7 and Hégǔ L.I.-4 it may be used to release and expel pathogenic factors binding the exterior and giving rise to chills and fever with cough, and to harmonise nutritive qi and defensive qi in cases of night sweating with chills and fever and aversion to cold.

According to Warp and Woof of Warm Febrile Diseases "The Lung and Heart are mutually connected, thus when there is Lung heat it most easily enters the Heart". Because of its ability to clear heat of excess or deficiency type from the Lung, and due to its profound effect on the gathering qi and the upper jiao in general, the action of Fèishū BL-13 extends to the Heart and various classics mention its use for disorders of the spirit such as mania, mad walking and even desire to commit suicide.

The Lung and Stomach have a particularly close relationship. Both have a strongly descending action, whilst the Lung channel originates in the middle jiao in the region of the Stomach. Failure of the Stomach qi to descend due to deficiency or food stagnation may therefore impair the Lung's descending function leading to coughing and dyspnoea, whilst failure of the Lung qi to descend may injure the Stomach's descending function and lead to rebellion of Stomach qi. Fèishū BL-13 is therefore indicated for fullness with no pleasure in eating, vomiting, vomiting of foam and vomiting of fluid after eating, and especially for vomiting accompanied by coughing.

A further important use of Fèishū BL-13 is for Lung disorders which give rise to pain of the upper back. In cases of children with severe Lung qi deficiency, there may even be rounding and deformity of the back (turtle back). This condition is referred to in the Essential Questions10 which says "The back is the residence of the chest and when the back is curved and the shoulders are hunched, the residence is about to fall into ruin".

Finally, according to the Illustrated Appendices to The Classic of Categories, Fèishū BL-13 is one of five points (Fèishū BL-13, Xīnshū BL-15, Gānshū BL-18, Píshū BL-20 and Shènshū BL-23) which "drain heat from the five zang".
