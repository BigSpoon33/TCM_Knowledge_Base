## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

As its name 'Wind Gate' implies, Fēngmén BL-12 is an important point to expel wind and release pathogenic factors from the exterior portion of the body. This action may be explained by three principal factors: i. Fēngmén BL-12 belongs to taiyang channel, the most exterior of the six channels, and therefore most commonly the first to be attacked by exterior pathogenic factors; ii. Fēngmén BL-12 is located on the upper back, over the upper portion of the Lung which is known as the 'delicate zang' due to its predisposition to be easily injured by exterior pathogens; iii. Fēngmén BL-12 is a meeting point of the Bladder channel with the Governing vessel which dominates all the yang channels of the body and hence has a close relationship to the exterior (yang) portion of the body.

When exterior pathogenic wind attacks via the skin, nose or mouth, it may i. obstruct the defensive qi and impair its warming function, giving rise to chills, aversion to wind and cold and headache, whilst fever which accompanies chills is a sign of the struggle between the defensive qi and the pathogen; ii. impair the disseminating and descending function of the Lung, resulting in copious nasal discharge and cough; iii. obstruct taiyang channel giving rise to rigidity and pain of the head and neck. Fēngmén BL-12 may be treated by needling or cupping to release the exterior in all cases of attack by wind-cold, wind-heat or wind-dryness which bind the superficial portion of the body and give rise to such excess exterior pathology. In the case of wind-cold, moxibustion may be used. Fēngmén BL-12 is also indicated for patterns of exterior deficiency where attack by wind gives rise to disharmony of nutritive qi and defensive qi, characterised by fever and chills unrelieved by sweating, aversion to wind and a weak floating pulse.

The ability of Fēngmén BL-12 to firm the exterior and strengthen the defensive qi, thus helping the body to resist attack by exterior pathogenic factors, is discussed in various classics. The Song of the Jade Dragon recommends it for "flaccidity of the interstices with frequent coughing and clear watery nasal discharge", whilst Methods of Acupuncture and Moxibustion from the Golden Mirror of Medicine recommends it for "flaccidity of the interstices with susceptibility to catching wind-cold". In other words, as well as releasing the exterior and expelling wind, Fēngmén BL-12 may be treated by needling or moxibustion to tonify the defensive qi in patients with susceptibility to catching frequent colds.

The nose is the gateway of the Lung. According to the Spiritual Pivot7 "The qi of the Lung opens into the nose; when the Lung is in harmony the nose is able to distinguish the fragrant from the foul". Methods of Acupuncture and Moxibustion from the Golden Mirror of Medicine recommends Fēngmén BL-12 for "nosebleed and all kinds of nose disorders". Nasal blockage and discharge commonly result from Lung and defensive qi deficiency with concomitant retention of pathogens in the nose and Lung, which render a person liable to frequent nasal stuffiness and discharge, sensitivity to dust and pollen, sneezing etc. The ability of Fēngmén BL-12 to firm the defensive qi, expel exterior pathogens and benefit the nose make it especially suitable in the treatment of such cases of perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis.

It is useful to compare the points Fēngmén BL-12 and Fèishū BL-13, each reflecting different aspects of the Lung function. Although Fēngmén BL-12 is indicated for painful cough and cough with bleeding, this is primarily in the context of exterior disease and its affinity for releasing the exterior and firming the defensive qi underlines its close connection with the more superficial and yang aspect of the Lung. It is significant however, that despite its ability to strengthen the defensive qi which is distributed by the Lung, it is not used to tonify other aspects of Lung deficiency for which the deeper (yin) action of Fèishū BL-13 is preferred.

According to the Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man "If Fēngmén BL-12 is repeatedly needled it will clear the hot yang qi and the back will always be free of sores and carbuncles". Finally the Essential Questions8 includes Fēngmén BL-12 among the eight points (bilateral Quēpén ST-12, Dàzhù BL-11, Zhōngfǔ LU-1 and Fēngmén BL-12) to clear heat from the chest.
