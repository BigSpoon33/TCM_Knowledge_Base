## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Sh√†oh«éi HE-3 is the he-sea and water point of the Heart shaoyin (lesser yin) channel, hence the name Shaohai (Lesser Sea). It has three main spheres of action. Firstly it is able to calm the spirit, transform phlegm and clear heat, being indicated in such disorders as mania and laughter, epilepsy, tongue thrusting (where the tongue is repeatedly thrust out of the mouth like a snake's tongue) and poor memory, as well as other manifestations of phlegm such as vomiting of foamy saliva and scrofula. Clinically, however, it is less used for this purpose than points such as JiƒÅnsh«ê P-5, Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40 and TiƒÅnj«êng SJ-10.

Secondly, as the water point of the Heart fire channel, Sh√†oh«éi HE-3 is able to drain heat from the head manifesting as redness of the eyes, erosion and swelling of the gums, and toothache accompanied by chills and fever.

The third and main clinical application of Sh√†oh«éi HE-3, however, is in the treatment of various disorders of the Heart channel in the upper limb. It is an important point for numbness and trembling of the arm and hand, and disorders of the elbow. According to the Classic of the Jade Dragon it is indicated for "fullness of the chest with agitation of the Heart accompanied by numbness and difficulty in raising the shoulder and arm". In the treatment of atrophy disorder and hemiplegia following windstroke, points of yangming channel, which is "abundant in qi and blood" have long been emphasised. Clinical practice has demonstrated, however, that better results are obtained when some points from yin channels are also selected. Due to the important action of Sh√†oh«éi HE-3 on disorders of the whole arm, it is often stimulated by through needling from Q≈´ch√≠ L.I.-11 in the treatment of these disorders.

Summary of clinical application
Mainly used to treat disorders of the arm and hand: trembling and numbness, wind painful obstruction, inability to raise the four limbs, swelling, pain or flaccidity of the elbow joint.
Combined with or through-needled from Quchi L.I.-11 for chronic hemiplegia or atrophy disorder of the arm.
Transforms phlegm which disturbs the spirit: mania, laughter, epilepsy, poor memory, vomiting of foamy (watery) saliva.
