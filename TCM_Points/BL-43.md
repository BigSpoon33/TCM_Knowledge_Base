## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The name 'Gaohuang' can be translated as 'Vital Region'. This concept, implying one of the deepest and most funda-mental regions of the body, is first mentioned in Master Zuo-jiu's Tradition of the Spring and Autumn Annals (580 BCE), one of the earliest textual references to acupuncture. The Prince of Jin who was gravely ill sent for the famous Doctor Yi Huan. After examining the patient, Doctor Huan declared that the disease had settled in the gaohuang region (between the Heart and the diaphragm) and hence "it cannot be purged, it cannot be reached [by needling], herbs will not penetrate it, there is nothing to be done"61.

Gāohuāngshū BL-43 was comprehensively discussed in a text called Method of Moxibustion at Gaohuangshu by Zhuang Zhuo in 1128. Zhuang was inspired to write this book after being cured of various diseases, including malaria and beri-beri, by three hundred moxa cones burnt on Gāohuāngshū BL-43. He measured the location of Gāohuāngshū BL-43 on people of various body builds and gave diagrams and specific instructions for locating the point.

In discussing this point, Sun Si-miao in the Thousand Ducat Formulas simply states "Gāohuāngshū BL-43, there is no [disorder] that it cannot treat" and "once moxibustion is completed, it causes a person's yang qi to be healthy and full". Many classical texts say that Gāohuāngshū BL-43 is contraindicated to needling and emphasise its treatment by moxibustion, for example the Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man recommends the application of a hundred or even as many as three hundred moxa cones to Gāohuāngshū BL-43. Early texts, however, stress that after moxibustion at Gāohuāngshū BL-43, moxibustion should also be applied to points below the umbilicus, e.g. Qìhǎi REN-6 and Guānyuán REN-4, in order to conduct downwards the heat thus generated.

Careful examination of the classical indications of this point demonstrate its actions on the Lung, Heart, Kidneys, Spleen and Stomach. Like Fèishū BL-13 and Pòhù BL-42, it is able to treat severe deficiency (especially of the yin) of the Lung, and is indicated for consumption, cough, coughing of blood, steaming bone disorder, night sweating and emaciation. By both nourishing and calming the Heart it is applicable in the treatment of poor memory, pounding of the Heart, insomnia and phlegm-fire mania. Acting on the Kidneys, it is able to treat seminal emission, with or without dreams, and impotence. By strengthening the middle jiao it is able to treat feebleness and deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach, undigested food in the stool and weariness of the four limbs. So great was the tonifying action of Gāohuāngshū BL-43 considered to be, that it was said to strengthen the original qi and treat every kind of deficiency, the five types of taxation and the seven injuries. Finally, it is interesting to note that Gāohuāngshū BL-43 was also indicated for 'phlegm diseases' and Sun Si-miao in his Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas says it "stops phlegm in chronic disease". The importance of phlegm as a pathological factor in difficult and chronic diseases is long documented and is reflected in such sayings as "The hundred diseases all pertain to phlegm", "Strange diseases often involve phlegm" and "There is no place that phlegm cannot reach".

Summary of clinical application
Tonifies extreme deficiency of the Lung, Heart, Kidneys, Spleen and Stomach: Lung deficiency taxation, cough, asthma, coughing blood, night sweating, spontaneous sweating, steaming bone disorder, consumption, emaciation, poor memory, pounding of the Heart, insomnia, seminal emission, impotence, feebleness and deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach, undigested food (in the stool), weariness of the four limbs, vomiting blood.
“Gaohuangshu BL-43, there is no [disorder] that it cannot treat” (Thousand Ducat Formulas).
