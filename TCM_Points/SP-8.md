## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Dìjī SP-8 is the xi-cleft point of the Spleen channel. The xi-cleft points are where the qi and blood, which flow relatively superficially along the channels from the jing-well points, gather and plunge more deeply. The xi-cleft points in general are indicated in the treatment of acute conditions and pain, whilst the xi-cleft points of the yin channels have an additional action of treating disorders of blood.

The Spleen controls blood and its channel enters the lower abdomen, joining with the Conception vessel at Zhōngjí REN-3 and Guānyuán REN-4. Dìjī SP-8 has a specific and important action on resolving blood stasis in the uterus and lower abdomen, being indicated in the treatment of dysmenorrhoea, irregular menstruation, and abdominal masses in women due to either blood stasis or qi stagnation. A specific indication for this point mentioned in the Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man is a hot flowing sensation spreading down the inner thigh to the knee when pressure is applied to abdominal masses in women. As the xi-cleft point, Dìjī SP-8 is especially suited to treating acute conditions, and it is often combined with Hégǔ L.I.-4 in the treatment of acute dysmenorrhoea, both points being strongly reduced, often with the addition of electro-acupuncture. Dìjī SP-8 has a secondary action of harmonising the Spleen and resolving damp, being indicated in the treatment of abdominal distention, poor appetite, difficult urination, oedema and leucorrhoea, especially when these symptoms accompany disorders of menstruation.

The affinity of Dìjī SP-8 for disorders of the lower abdomen is emphasised in various classics. The Investigation Into Points Along the ChannelsInvestigation Into Points Along the Channels by Yan Zhen-shi of the Ming dynasty goes as far as to say "there is no disorder of the lower region that cannot be treated with Dìjī SP-8", whilst according to the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries Dìjī SP-8 dominates the lower region (Dàbāo SP-21 dominates the upper region and Tiānshū ST-25 the middle region). In the correspondence system of early Chinese thought, the upper region is heaven, the middle region is man and the lower region is earth, hence the name of this point 'Earth Pivot'.

Summary of clinical application
Important point for dysmenorrhoea, uterine masses, abdominal masses and irregular menstruation.
Often combined with Hegu L.I.-4 for acute dysmenorrhoea.
For abdominal distention, poor appetite, difficult urination, oedema and leucorrhoea, especially when these symptoms accompany disorders of menstruation.
