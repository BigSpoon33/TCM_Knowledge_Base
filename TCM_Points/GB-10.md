## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The points Fúbái GB-10, Tóuqiàoyīn GB-11 and to a certain extent Tiānchōng GB-9, have certain comparable indications and these are not dissimilar to the indications for the points of the Window of Heaven. All are indicated for goitre, and Fúbái GB-10additionally for stiffness, swelling and pain of the neck. Both Fúbái GB-10 (headache, toothache, deafness and tinnitus) and Tóuqiàoyīn GB-11 (headache and eye, ear, tongue and mouth disorders) are indicated for disorders of the head and sense organs and for rebellion of Lung qi characterised by cough. Both also treat disorders of the lower body, Fúbái GB-10 for flaccidity of the legs with inability to walk, and Tóuqiàoyīn GB-11 for contraction of the sinews of the four limbs, bone consumption, and agitation and heat of the hands and feet. This latter application reflects the principle expounded in the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic1 "When the disease is below select [points] from above".
