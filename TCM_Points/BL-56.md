## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

As its name 'Support the Sinews' implies, Chéngjīn BL-56 is indicated for pain and contraction of the muscles and sinews, especially in the lumbar region and calf.

It is one of the attributes of the channels that as they travel distally towards the hand or foot, their points have an increasingly pronounced action on the whole length of the channel. Although not a major point, Chéngjīn BL-56 is characterised by its ability to treat disorders of the whole Bladder channel in the head (dizziness, headache, heat in the head, nosebleed, rhinitis), the lumbar region, the lower leg and calf, and the foot and heel.

Heel pain is often a difficult disorder to treat, and requires not only local points on the heel itself, but also proximal points. Chéngjīn BL-56 and Chéngshān BL-57 are the two principal proximal points that affect this region of the foot.

Finally, like several distal points of the Bladder channel, Chéngjīn BL-56 treats both swelling of the axilla and haemorrhoids. This may be explained by the pathways of the Bladder sinew channel to the axilla and the Bladder divergent channel which winds around the anus.

Summary of clinical application
For pain and contraction of the muscles and sinews, especially in the lumbar region and calf.
For disorders along the whole course of the Bladder channel, e.g. dizziness, headache, heat in the head, nosebleed, rhinitis, haemorrhoids, pain of the lumbar region, lower leg, calf, foot and heel.
