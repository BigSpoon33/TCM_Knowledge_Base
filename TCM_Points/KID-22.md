## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The points Bùláng KID-22, Shénfēng KID-23, Língxū KID-24, Shéncáng KID-25, Yùzhōng KID-26 and Shūfǔ KID-27 were listed in the Essential Questions as the twelve shu points of the chest. They share the common actions of descending rebellious qi of the Lung and Stomach, and are particularly indicated for wheezing, dyspnoea and coughing due to 'fullness above and deficiency below'. This occurs when the Kidney qi is insufficiently strong to grasp the Lung qi.
