## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Dàhéng SP-15 is an important point for regulating the qi of the Large Intestine. It is indicated for the treatment of diarrhoea, especially of cold or damp type, and due to its ability to move the qi of the Large Intestine is also used in the treatment of constipation due to many different aetiologies. Both Dàhéng SP-15 and Tiānshū ST-25, its neighbouring point, are effective in the treatment of a variety of disorders of the intestines. Clinically, however, Tiānshū ST-25 is predominantly used for loose stools, diarrhoea and dysenteric disorder, whilst Dàhéng SP-15 is favoured for constipation.

Dàhéng SP-15 is also indicated and included in classical combinations for sadness, weeping and sighing. Whilst there is no special theoretical reason why Dàhéng SP-15 should have this action, it is interesting to compare it with its neighbouring points Tàiyǐ ST-23 and Huaroumen ST‑24 which also have several psycho-emotional indications.

Summary of clinical application
Commonly used for constipation, often in preference to Tianshu ST-25. Also indicated for cold or damp diarrhoea and dysenteric disorder
Like Taiyi ST-23 and Huaroumen ST-24, treats disorders of the spirit: propensity to sadness, sighing.
