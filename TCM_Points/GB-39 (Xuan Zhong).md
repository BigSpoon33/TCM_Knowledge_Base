## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Xuánzhōng GB-39 is the hui-meeting point for the 'marrow' which is the source of both the 'sea of marrow' (the brain) and the bone marrow. There is little evidence in classical texts of the ability of Xuánzhōng GB-39 to nourish the sea of marrow, in other words to treat diseases of the head and brain, and even headache and dizziness are modern rather than traditional indications.

Xuánzhōng GB-39, however, has a strong action on benefiting the bone marrow, sinews and bones and is indicated for a wide range of disorders characterised by weakness, flaccidity, contraction and pain of the limbs. This latter action is complemented by its ability to dispel wind-damp. According to the Essential Questions19 "In bone painful obstruction the pathogenic factor reaches the Kidneys; in sinew painful obstruction it reaches the Liver". In chronic painful obstruction, therefore, prolonged retention of wind-damp which injures the sinews and bones will eventually deplete the Liver and Kidneys and hence the marrow. Prolonged deficiency of the Liver and Kidneys and insufficiency of essence, resulting in malnourishment of the sinews, may also give rise to atrophy disorder. By its action of nourishing the marrow and benefiting the sinews and bones Xuánzhōng GB-39 is therefore indicated for both chronic painful obstruction and atrophy disorder, hence the references to the use of Xuánzhōng GB-39 in wind-taxation with heaviness of the body, injury by cold pathogen leading to taxation and deficiency-taxation. The term taxation here denotes the extreme deficiency that arises due to chronic retention of pathogenic factors. According to the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries, the great Han dynasty physician Hua Tuo needled Xuánzhōng GB-39 and Huántiào GB-30 for lameness of the legs, and "immediately the patient was able to walk".

The Gall Bladder primary and sinew channels pass through different portions of the neck. By virtue of its actions of benefiting the sinews and bones and activating the channel and alleviating pain, Xuánzhōng GB-39 is the main distal point on the Gall Bladder channel for disorders of the neck, both acute and chronic.

Xuánzhōng GB-39 has a further action of promoting the smooth flow of Liver and Gall Bladder qi, and clearing Gall Bladder fire primarily arising from the transformation of stagnant qi. It is indicated for distention of the chest and abdomen, fullness and distention of the Heart and abdomen, soreness and pain of the lateral costal region, anxiety, indignation, anger and mania. Gall Bladder fire may easily transmit to the Stomach, resulting in Stomach heat, or obstruct the Stomach descending function leading to lack of appetite. The Gall Bladder sinew channel binds at the side of the nose and the primary channel connects with the Governing vessel at Chángqiáng DU-1. By clearing Gall Bladder fire, Xuánzhōng GB-39 is also indicated for dryness of the nose, nosebleed and haemorrhoids.

Summary of clinical application
Treats weakness, flaccidity, contraction and pain of the limbs; for chronic painful obstruction and chronic atrophy disorder. “In bone painful obstruction the pathogenic factor reaches the Kidneys; in sinew painful obstruction it reaches the Liver” (Essential Questions).
Important distal point for stiffness and pain of the neck.
Clears stagnant qi and fire: distention and pain of the chest, Heart, lateral costal region and abdomen; anxiety, indignation, anger and mania; nosebleed and haemorrhoids.
