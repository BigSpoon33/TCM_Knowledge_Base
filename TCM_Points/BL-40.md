## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Wěizhōng BL-40 is the he-sea point of the Bladder channel and has long been considered one of the most important of the acupuncture points. According to Ma Dan-yang the great physician of the Jin dynasty, Wěizhōng BL-40 is one of the 'eleven heavenly star points'54, indicated for "lumbar pain with inability to straighten up, severe lumbar pain that radiates up the back with pain and stiffness of the sinews and bones, wind painful obstruction that frequently recurs, and difficulty in stretching and bending the knee". The Ming dynasty author Gao Wu in the Glorious Anthology of Acupuncture and Moxibustion included it among his 'four command points' with a special action in the treatment of lumbar pain. Sun Si-miao in the Thousand Ducat Formulas says of Wěizhōng BL-40 "pain of the lumbar region and spine that almost reaches the head; in any case of heaviness and pain of the lumbar region and leg, bleed this point".

Wěizhōng BL-40 is equally effective for acute or chronic lumbar pain, whatever the aetiology, and for sciatic pain radiating down the Bladder channel, and is an important point for atrophy disorder and painful obstruction of the lower limb. In the case of acute lumbar sprain, Wěizhōng BL-40 may either be needled, or bled by the following method. The region of Wěizhōng BL-40 is examined (on the affected side if the sprain is unilateral and on both sides if bilateral). If dark and engorged blood vessels are seen at or around this point, the patient is asked to stand (resting their hands on the couch), the blood vessels are slapped to further engorge them and promote the flow of blood, then wiped with alcohol and quickly pricked to induce bleeding.

Wěizhōng BL-40 is also an important local point in the treatment of knee disorders, whether the location of the discomfort is at the back or the front of the knee, and needling at this point allows deep insertion into the joint.

An alternative name for Wěizhōng BL-40 used in a number of classics is Xue Xi, (Blood Xi-Cleft). According to the Spiritual Pivot55 "taiyang channel is abundant in blood and limited in qi ... [it is thus suitable to] prick to bleed taiyang and drain blood ...". This not only explains the powerful effect of bleeding Wěizhōng BL-40 to move blood stasis in acute lumbar sprain, but also its ability to cool the blood in cases of nosebleed and a variety of skin disorders, in which case the point may also be bled. Interestingly, one of the other two channels abundant in blood and limited in qi according to the Spiritual Pivot56 is the jueyin channel, and this may help to explain certain similarities between Wěizhōng BL-40 and Qūzé P-3, the he-sea point of the Pericardium jueyin channel. Both points (located in the flexure of the lower and upper limb respectively) are bled to clear heat from the blood level and are used in the treatment of summer-heat stroke, sudden turmoil disorder with heat of the four limbs, ceaseless thirst, vomiting and diarrhoea. As far as Wěizhōng BL-40 is concerned, not only is it indicated for fever due to summer-heat, but also for febrile disease with absence of sweating, injury by cold with heat of the four limbs, alternating chills and fever and malaria.

The Spiritual Pivot57 states "When the disease is at the yang within yang (skin), needle the he-sea points of the yang channels". Whilst this is not a universally applicable principle, it is Qūchí L.I.-11 and Wěizhōng BL-40, the he-sea points of the Large Intestine and Bladder channels, which are two of the most important points in the treatment of skin diseases. Wěizhōng BL-40 is indicated for erysipelas (cinnabar toxin), eczema and urticaria.

Relatively few points on the Bladder channel treat their related Bladder fu, notably Pángguāngshū BL-28 (the back-shu point of the Bladder), Shènshū BL-23 (the back-shu point of the Kidneys), Wěiyáng BL-39 (the lower he-sea point of the Sanjiao) and points adjacent to the bladder on the lower back. Wěizhōng BL-40 itself is indicated for a variety of urinary disorders characterised by enuresis, difficult urination, dark urination, and distention and pain of the hypogastrium, and this may in part be explained by its close proximity to Wěiyáng BL-39.

The Bladder divergent channel separates from its primary channel at the popliteal fossa and ascends to wind around the anus. Wěizhōng BL-40 is indicated and included in classical combinations for the treatment of haemorrhoids, often in combination with Chéngshān BL-57 which is considered the primary distal point for this purpose.

Finally, according to the Essential Questions58 Wěizhōng BL-40 is one of the 'eight points for draining heat from the extremities' (although in fact only seven are listed) namely Yúnmén LU-2, Jiānyú L.I.-15, Wěizhōng BL-40 and Yāoshū DU-2.

Summary of clinical application
Much used for acute or chronic lumbar pain (needled or pricked to bleed), sciatica, knee disorders, weakness of the legs, atrophy disorder and painful obstruction of the lower limb, hemiplegia.
Treats injury by summer-heat and other febrile diseases, especially with vomiting and diarrhoea. Also febrile disease with absence of sweating, injury by cold with heat of the four limbs, alternating chills and fever, malaria, ceaseless thirst, sudden turmoil disorder, dysenteric disorder.
Clears heat from the blood: nosebleed, erysipelas, eczema, urticaria, clove sores.
