## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

After passing over the vertex of the head, the Governing vessel descends through the nose. Sh√†ngxƒ´ng DU-23, located directly above the nose, is in a commanding position to regulate the widest range of nasal disorders and is an important point clinically in the treatment of nasal obstruction and discharge, pain of sinusitis, rhinitis, inability to smell, nosebleed and nasal polyps.

An alternative name for this point is Mingtang (Hall of Brightness) reflecting the fact that from the earliest times Sh√†ngxƒ´ng DU-23 has also been considered valuable in treating eye diseases including short sightedness, eye pain, visual impairment and visual dizziness. This may be explained both by the proximity of this point to the eye region and by the fact that the anterior pathway of the Governing vessel ascends to below the middle of the eye. Interestingly, several classical texts warn that if this point is treated by excessive moxibustion it will raise the yang and lead to lack of clarity of vision.

A number of further alternative names for this point reflect its status as one of the 'thirteen ghost points' listed in the Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas of Sun Si-miao for the treatment of mania disorder and epilepsy. These include Guitang (Ghost Hall), Guigong (Ghost Palace) and Shentang (Hall of the Spirit).

Finally Sh√†ngxƒ´ng DU-23 is indicated for various kinds of swelling in the upper region, including redness and swelling of the face, deficiency swelling of the face, and swelling of the skin of the head.

Summary of clinical application
Commonly used for nasal disorders: nasal obstruction and discharge, pain of sinusitis, rhinitis, inability to smell, nosebleed, nasal polyps.
For eye diseases: visual impairment, short sightedness, eye pain, visual dizziness.
For redness and swelling of the face, deficiency swelling of the face, and swelling of the skin of the head.
