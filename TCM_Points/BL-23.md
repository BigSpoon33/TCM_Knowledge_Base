## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Sh√®nsh≈´ BL-23 is the back-shu point of the Kidney zang where the qi of the Kidneys emanates from the interior to the body surface, and like all the back-shu points (especially those of the zang) has a strong action on regulating and tonifying its corresponding zangfu at the deepest level. Sh√®nsh≈´ BL-23 is one of the principal acupuncture points to strengthen the Kidneys, fortify yang, nourish yin, and benefit essence.

According to the Spiritual Pivot37 "The Kidneys store the essence" and "essence is the source of life". The Essential Questions38 states "Essence is the root of the human body", whilst a saying of Chinese medicine emphasises "The Kidney is the root of pre-heaven". Since neither essence nor pre-heaven qi can ever be excessive, the Kidneys can only suffer from deficiency patterns. Kidney deficiency may be congenital in origin, or may develop during the course of a person's life as a result of chronic illness, dissipation, excessive sexual activity, overwork, old age, prolonged fear, or prolonged disharmony of other zangfu which eventually transmits to the Kidneys. Deficiency of the Kidneys is subdivided into the following patterns: i. Kidney qi not firm, ii. Failure of the Kidneys to grasp the qi, iii. deficiency of Kidney essence, iv. deficiency of Kidney yang, v. deficiency of Kidney yin. Sh√®nsh≈´ BL-23 is an essential point in the treatment of all these patterns.

The Kidneys dominate the two lower yin (urethra and anus) and control the opening and closing of the Bladder and its qi transformation function. Deficiency of the Kidney qi (Kidney qi not firm) therefore, may impair the Kidneys' ability to firmly hold and astringe the urine resulting in such symptoms of leakage as frequent urination, dripping urination, enuresis, white turbidity due to deficiency and exhaustion etc.

According to the Master Hua's Classic of the Central Viscera by the great Han dynasty physician Hua Tuo, the Kidneys "serve the purpose of shutting in the essence in males"39. Deficiency of Kidney qi, therefore, may give rise to leakage of essence manifesting as seminal emission, seminal emission with dreams, urine containing semen and premature ejaculation. This kind of leakage may be seen in the context of qi deficiency alone (in other words without accompanying symptoms of cold or heat), or as part of deficiency of either Kidney yang or Kidney yin, more commonly the former since qi belongs to the broad category of yang. Whatever the pattern, Sh√®nsh≈´ BL-23 is an important point to firm the holding and astringing action of the Kidneys.

The Kidneys control the movement of water throughout the body, and although the Spleen and Lung also play an important role in the circulation of fluids, their yang qi is ultimately dependent on that of the Kidneys. This is reflected in the statement that the Kidneys dominate the yang of the whole body and govern water'. When Kidney yang fails to move the body fluids there may be oedema with difficult urination. The Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas says "Sh√®nsh≈´ BL-23 treats the hundred oedematous diseases" (i.e. any kind of oedema).

The uterus depends on the Kidney essence for its growth, maturation and nourishment, the Penetrating and Conception vessels are both nourished by and have their root in the Kidneys, and the Essential Questions says "the vessel of the uterus connects with the Kidneys"40. Sh√®nsh≈´ BL-23 is indicated for a variety of disorders of the uterus including irregular menstruation due to Kidney deficiency, chronic cold of the uterus giving rise to taxation, 'emaciation in women due to sexual intercourse during menstruation' and leucorrhoea.

The intimate relationship between the Kidney yang and ming men (the gate of life) has been emphasised in numerous classics. According to the Classic of Difficulties41 "On the left is the Kidney, on the right is ming men", whilst Li Dong-yuan wrote "The dynamic qi that moves between the Kidneys is ming men". Zhang Jing-yue of the Ming dynasty stated "ming men resides between the Kidneys" and "ming men is the root of original qi and the residence of the water and fire; without it the yin qi of the five zang is unable to grow, the yang qi of the five zang is unable to develop". The Kidney yang therefore corresponds to ming men fire and is the source of the fire of the whole body. Failure of Kidney yang to warm the body leads to such symptoms as chronic cold of the uterus, lumbar region, legs and bones. Decline of the Kidney yang and waning of ming men fire may lead to weakness of the sexual function and hence impotence. Kidney yang is also the source of Spleen yang. When Kidney yang is unable to warm Spleen and Stomach earth there may be chronic diarrhoea due to cold or dampness, diarrhoea containing undigested food, cold and distention of the Stomach, and cold vomiting. The diarrhoea associated with this pattern characteristically occurs in the early hours of the morning and is known as fifth-watch (cockcrow) diarrhoea. The Complete Works of Jing-yue stated "The opening and closing of the two excretions is dominated by the Kidneys. When the yang qi of the Kidneys is insufficient, then ming men is in decline and yin cold is in abundance; therefore after the fifth watch when the yang qi of the Kidneys is in decline and the yin qi is reaching its zenith there will be ceaseless diarrhoea".

According to the Complete Works of Jing-yue "The Lung is the master of qi, the Kidneys are the root of qi. The Lung dominates the exhalation of qi whilst the Kidneys dominate the reception of qi. Only when yin and yang are mutually communicating is respiration harmonious". This quotation emphasises the essential role of the Kidneys in normal respiration. The Lung is the uppermost zang with the function of descending the qi and controlling exhalation, whilst the Kidneys are the bottomost zang with the function of grasping the qi and controlling inhalation. If Kidney qi is deficient and unable to grasp and hold the Lung qi there may be dyspnoea, asthma or cough. This pattern is characterised by its chronic nature and is usually seen with other accompanying signs of Kidney deficiency. As is the case with Kidney qi not firm, this pattern may be seen either without symptoms of cold or heat, or in the context of deficiency of either Kidney yang or Kidney yin.

According to Essential Readings from the Medical Tradition "The fire and water of the human body is yin and yang ... without yang, yin cannot engender; without yin, yang cannot transform" whilst in the Complete Works of Jing-yue it is said "yin and yang are of the same origin...fire is the ruler of water, water is the source of fire...". These quotations underline the inseparable relationship of the yin and yang of the Kidneys and help explain why all acupuncture points which treat the Kidneys invariably benefit both Kidney yin and Kidney yang. Although the indications for Sh√®nsh≈´ BL-23 emphasise deficiency of Kidney qi or Kidney yang, therefore, it also has an action on nourishing Kidney yin.

Like Kidney yang, Kidney yin is the root of the yin of the whole body. Kidney yin deficiency may lead to impaired nourishment of the body and the flaring up of deficiency fire, giving rise to such symptoms as emaciation, wasting and thirsting disorder, and redness and heat of the face and body.

It is a characteristic of the yin back-shu points that they nourish and regulate their corresponding sense organs. According to the Spiritual Pivot42 "The Kidneys open into the ears; if the Kidneys are in harmony, the ears can hear the five sounds". Since the Kidneys store essence, produce marrow which fills up the brain and dominate yin, Sh√®nsh≈´ BL-23 is indicated not only for ear disorders such as tinnitus and deafness, but also for blurred vision, night blindness and visual dizziness, all due to deficiency of marrow, essence or yin.

Since the Kidney yin and yang are the root of the yin fluids and the yang qi of the body, this explains the action of Sh√®nsh≈´ BL-23 in diseases of chronic deficiency. It is indicated for the five taxations and the seven injuries, taxation of the five zang, and prolonged accumulation of cold leading to taxation. The five taxations as discussed in the Spiritual Pivot are i. excessive use of the eyes which injures the blood, ii. excessive lying down which injures the qi, iii. excessive sitting which injures the flesh, iv. excessive standing which injures the bones, and v. excessive walking which injures the sinews. In later texts, the concept of the five taxations was also used to refer to taxation of each of the five zang. Although also referring to a range of male genital disorders (see glossary), the seven injuries in this context are i. overeating which injures the Spleen, ii. great anger which injures the Liver, iii. heavy lifting or prolonged sitting on damp ground which injure the Kidneys, iv. pathogenic cold which injures the Lung, v. worry and anxiety which injure the Heart, vi. wind, rain, cold and summer-heat which injure the body, and vii. excessive fear which injures the emotions.

According to the Essential Questions "The Kidneys store the qi of the bone marrow"43, "The Kidneys reside in the lumbar region"44, "The Kidneys generate bone marrow"45 and " ... when there is internal attack, and heat resides in the Kidneys, then the bones will wither and the marrow will be deficient, therefore the legs will not be able to support the body and bone atrophy disorder will develop"46. Any Kidney deficiency pattern may give rise to chronic lumbar pain and weakness or soreness of the knees, whilst in cases of Kidney yin deficiency there may be hot sensations in the bones and in case of Kidney yang deficiency, cold sensations of the bones. Located in the lumbar region and having a direct action on the Kidney zang, Sh√®nsh≈´ BL-23 is an essential point in the treatment of any kind of lumbar pain which has its root in Kidney deficiency, as well as Kidney deficient atrophy disorder and hemiplegia.

Finally the Illustrated Supplement to the Classic of Categories states that Sh√®nsh≈´ BL-23 is one of five points (F√®ish≈´ BL-13, Xƒ´nsh≈´ BL-15, GƒÅnsh≈´ BL-18, P√≠sh≈´ BL-20 and Sh√®nsh≈´ BL-23) which "drain heat from the five zang".
