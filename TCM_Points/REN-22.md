## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

In common with many points of the Conception vessel, TiƒÅnt√∫ REN-22 has a strong action on descending qi. Located in-between the lungs and below the throat, its principal application is in the treatment of a wide variety of disorders affecting these two areas.

TiƒÅnt√∫ REN-22 has long been recognised as an important point to treat Lung disorders, for example the Essential Questions 25 recommended it for rebellious qi, inability to breathe and shortness of breath. Like other points situated in the uppermost portion of the chest (for example Zh≈çngf«î LU-1), TiƒÅnt√∫ REN-22 is principally used to treat excess patterns characterised by upward rebellion of Lung qi, including cough, asthma, sudden dyspnoea, inability to breathe and Lung abscess with purulent bloody coughing.

As far as throat disorders are concerned, TiƒÅnt√∫ REN-22 may be used in virtually any clinical situation, ranging from dryness, cold sensation, swelling and pain, to plumstone qi and severe ulceration which prevents eating. It is also an important point for disorders of the voice including cracked voice, loss of voice and inability to speak. In modern clinical practice, the most common application of this point is in the treatment of wheezing and asthma, especially when accompanied by accumulation of phlegm in the throat.

TiƒÅnt√∫ REN-22 is a meeting point of the Conception vessel with the Yin Linking vessel. The Yin Linking vessel ascends through the chest region and according to the Classic of Difficulties 26 "when the Yin Linking vessel alone is diseased it will cause Heart pain". TiƒÅnt√∫ REN-22 is specifically indicated for obstruction of qi with Heart pain and pain of the Heart and the back.

Finally, TiƒÅnt√∫ REN-22 is one of ten points listed in Chapter 2 of the Spiritual Pivot that have come to be known as Window of Heaven points (for a fuller discussion see Points of the Window of Heaven). It illustrates many of the characteristic actions of these points in its ability to treat goitre, rebellious qi of the Lung and Stomach and sudden onset of disorders (sudden loss of voice).

Summary of clinical application
