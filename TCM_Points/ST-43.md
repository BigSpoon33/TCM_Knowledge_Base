## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

A number of classics cite Xi√†ng«î ST-43 for the treatment of oedema, especially of the face and eye region. The name Sunken Valley conjures up the image of a place where water accumulates and gathers, and is considered to reflect this usage. Its application in oedema may be explained both by the course of the yangming channel which governs the face, and by the intimate relationship between the Stomach and the Spleen, which plays an important role in the transportation and transformation of fluids. The action of Xi√†ng«î ST-43 on regulating the Spleen is further reflected by its use in the treatment of borborygmus and abdominal distention.

Xi√†ng«î ST-43 is traditionally indicated for disorders such as swelling and pain of the dorsum of the foot and difficulty in flexing and extending the toes. In more recent times, however, Xi√†ng«î ST-43 has been used in combination with H√©g«î L.I.-4 in the treatment of febrile painful obstruction in any region of the body. Febrile painful obstruction is painful obstruction which manifests with redness, swelling, heat and pain of the joints, aversion to heat in the affected area and systemic signs such as fever, constipation, thirst etc.

Summary of clinical application
Classically emphasised for the treatment of facial oedema.
More recently used for the treatment of febrile (hot) painful obstruction.
Also for abdominal pain, distention and fullness, borborygmus, fullness of the chest and lateral costal region, belching.
For swelling and pain of the dorsum of the foot, difficulty in flexing and extending the toes.
