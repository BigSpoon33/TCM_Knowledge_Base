## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

TiƒÅny«íu SJ-16 is one of five points referred to in Chapter 21 of the Spiritual Pivot as points of the 'Window of Heaven', and in this passage it is said "Sudden deafness with excess of qi, dimness of vision and hearing, select TiƒÅny«íu SJ-16". TiƒÅny«íu SJ-16 (Window of Heaven) in fact gave this group of points its name. In his commentary on the above passage, Zhou Zhi-cong said "The points and the orifices of the head and face are like the great windows of a high pavilion by virtue of which qi moves. When there is inversion qi below, then the channels in the upper region do not move and there is lack of clarity of vision and hearing ... ".

In common with the other points of the Window of Heaven, TiƒÅny«íu SJ-16 is able to regulate and balance the qi between the head and the body, and is indicated when inversion qi (chaotic and rebellious qi) rushes to the head. This gives rise to such symptoms as headache and dizziness, sudden onset of deafness, swelling of the face and disorders of the eyes and nose.

Also in common with other Window of Heaven points, TiƒÅny«íu SJ-16 treats scrofula.
