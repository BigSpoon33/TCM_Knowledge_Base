## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Ji≈´w√©i REN-15 is the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel, from where the qi of this channel disperses and spreads down over the abdomen. The name of Ji≈´w√©i REN-15 (Turtledove Tail) reflects the shape of the xiphoid process, likened to the tail of a dove, with the ribs forming the wings. In fact, historically there has been some discussion as to whether Hu√¨yƒ´n REN-1, rather than Ji≈´w√©i REN-15, is the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel. The Spiritual Pivot 19 refers to the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel as Weiyi (Tail Screen), an alternative name for Ji≈´w√©i REN-15, and gives symptoms of excess (pain of the skin of the abdomen) and deficiency (itching of the skin of the abdomen). Later classics, however, including both the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion refer to the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel as Pingyi (Flat Screen), an alternative name for Hu√¨yƒ´n REN-1, and ascribe these symptoms of excess and deficiency to that point. Hu√¨yƒ´n REN-1 rather than Ji≈´w√©i REN-15 as the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel would reflect a neat symmetry with Ch√°ngqi√°ng DU-1 as the luo-connecting point of the Governing vessel.

Like J√πgu√® REN-14, the front-mu point of the Heart, Ji≈´w√©i REN-15 has a powerful action on calming the spirit in cases of phlegm obscuring the Heart (epilepsy, mania disorder, mad singing and walking and aversion to the sound of people talking), as well as regulating stagnation of qi and blood in the Heart region giving rise to oppression and pain. Also like J√πgu√® REN-14, Ji≈´w√©i REN-15 is able to regulate and descend Lung qi in cases of wheezing, cough, dyspnoea etc.

In the Spiritual Pivot 20 Ji≈´w√©i REN-15 is listed as the yuan point of the 'gao'. This term, the same gao as in GƒÅohuƒÅngsh≈´ BL-43, refers to the area below the Heart, whilst 'huang' refers to the area above the diaphragm. It is said that when a disease enters the gaohuang it is difficult to cure. Master Zuo-jiu's Tradition of the Spring and Autumn Annals 21 , one of the earliest textual references to acupuncture, describes how when the Prince of Jin was gravely ill, he sent for the famous Doctor Yi Huan. After examining the patient, Doctor Huan declared that the disease had settled in the gaohuang region (between the Heart and the diaphragm) and hence "it cannot be purged, it cannot be reached [by needling], herbs will not penetrate it, there is nothing to be done". Despite the statement by the Spiritual Pivot which implies that the gao originates at Ji≈´w√©i REN-15, this point is not normally understood to treat deep and chronic deficiency diseases, the only relevant indications being 'diminished qi' and 'excessive sexual activity leading to exhaustion in youths'.

Summary of clinical application
