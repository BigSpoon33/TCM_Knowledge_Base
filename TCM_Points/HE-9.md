## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Sh√†och≈çng HE-9 is the jing-well point, and thus the terminal and most dynamic point, of the Heart shaoyin (lesser yin) channel, hence the name Lesser Rushing. It shares with the jing-well points of the twelve channels three principal characteristics. Firstly it is able to restore consciousness in cases of collapse, for example from windstroke. Secondly, it has a strong action on clearing heat from the opposite end of the channel. The Heart primary channel ascends alongside the oesophagus and connects with the tissues surrounding the eye, the Heart divergent channel ascends along the throat, and the Heart luo-connecting channel ascends to the root of the tongue and the eye. Sh√†och≈çng HE-9 is effective to clear heat from the upper reaches of all of these branches of the Heart channel in the tongue (swelling and pain), throat (painful obstruction and dryness), mouth (heat) and eyes (redness and pain), as well as being able to clear febrile heat disturbing the spirit and giving rise to agitation and restlessness. Thirdly the Classic of Difficulties states that the jing-well points treat "fullness below the Heart"16. The region 'below the Heart' specifically refers to the apex of the epigastrium, but many of the jing-well points in fact treat stagnation and fullness throughout the chest region, and Sh√†och≈çng HE-9 is indicated for pain of the Heart, chest and lateral costal region.

Whilst its modern clinical use emphasises the treatment of such excess disorders, classical texts place equal weight on its ability to treat Heart qi deficiency. Thus the Song of the Jade Dragon states "What of diseases of cold Gall Bladder and Heart deficiency? Bilateral Sh√†och≈çng HE-9 is the most effective", and the Song of the Primary Points of the Fourteen Channels similarly prescribes it for Heart and Gall Bladder qi deficiency. Since Sh√†och≈çng HE-9 is the wood point of the Heart fire channel, this reflects the principle of treating the mother to nourish the child.

Summary of clinical application
As the jing-well point restores consciousness and treats urgent conditions of the Heart and spirit: loss of consciousness (from windstroke), mania-depression, epilepsy, sighing, fright and sadness with diminished qi.
Treats the upper portion of the Heart channel: pain at the root of the tongue, swollen tongue, tongue thrusting, throat painful obstruction, dry throat, heat in the mouth, eye pain, red eyes, yellow eyes.
