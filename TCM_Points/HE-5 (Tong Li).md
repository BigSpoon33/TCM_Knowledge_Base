## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Tōnglǐ HE-5 was included by Ma Dan-yang, the great physician of the Jin dynasty, among the 'eleven heavenly star points'7, his grouping of the most vital acupuncture points, and was indicated by him for "inability to speak despite a desire to do so, vexation and anger, pounding of the Heart; when excess there is heaviness of the four limbs, and the head, cheeks and face are red; when deficient there is inability to eat, sudden loss of voice and an expressionless face".

Tōnglǐ HE-5 is the luo-connecting point of the Heart channel, from where the luo-connecting channel penetrates deeply into the Heart zang, strengthening the zang-channel relationship, hence the name 'Penetrating the Interior'. It has two principal actions on the Heart: i. to calm the spirit, and ii. to regulate Heart qi.

The Spiritual Pivot8 is the earliest text to record the fundamental principle that "the Heart is the residence of the spirit". The function of housing the spirit in Chinese medicine encompasses mental activity, consciousness, memory, thinking and sleep. At the same time it also refers to the totality of the emotional and spiritual life of a person. According to the Ode of the Jade Dragon "Tōnglǐ HE-5 treats a frightenable Heart". Tōnglǐ HE-5 shares with most of the other luo-connecting points of the yin channels (Lièquē LU-7, Gōngsūn SP-4, Dàzhōng KID-4, Lǐgōu LIV-5 and Nèiguān P-6) the special ability to treat psycho-emotional disorders, but as the luo-connecting point of the Heart zang it is especially suitable for this purpose and is wide-ranging in its effect. Its action on calming the spirit, however, focuses on emotional disorders, rather than disturbances of sleep or memory, for which Shénmén HE-7 is more effective. According to Fei Bo-xiong9 "The seven emotions injure the five yin organs selectively but they all affect the Heart". Tōnglǐ HE-5 is classically indicated for many different emotional manifestations, not only fright and agitation which are traditionally associated with disharmony of the Heart, but fear, vexation, anger, sadness and depression which are usually considered to injure, or result from injury to, other zangfu. The great doctor Hua Tuo said of the relationship between the Heart and fear "excessive thought gives rise to apprehension, and apprehension injures the Heart; an injured Heart gives rise to loss of spirit, and loss of spirit gives rise to fright and fear"10.

As for regulating the Heart qi, Tōnglǐ HE-5 plays an important role in the treatment of palpitations, fright palpitations, pounding of the Heart and disorders of heart rhythm. In Chinese medicine, palpitations are subdivided into i. simple palpitations which is a general term, ii. fright palpitations which denotes palpitations that are either triggered by or accompanied by feelings of fright, and iii. pounding of the Heart (the most serious kind) which denotes palpitations which may be felt as high up as the heart itself, or as low as the umbilicus (the termination point of the Heart sinew channel). Palpitations may accompany any pattern of the Heart zang, but as a disorder of the rhythmical beating of the heart they always involve the Heart qi.

The pathways of the Heart primary and secondary channels serve to clarify various other classical indications of this point. According to a saying of Chinese medicine, "the tongue is the sprouting forth of the Heart", and the Heart luo-connecting channel, after entering the Heart zang, ascends to the root of the tongue. For this reason, Tōnglǐ HE-5 is the primary point to treat loss of voice and stiffness of the tongue which affects the speech, usually resulting from mental disorders or the sequelae of windstroke. It is also indicated for the treatment of stuttering. The Heart channel connects with the tissues surrounding the eye, whilst the luo-connecting channel from Tōnglǐ HE-5 both spreads to the Heart's interiorly-exteriorly coupled Small Intestine channel and ascends to the eye. Tōnglǐ HE-5 is indicated for (and included in a number of classical combinations for) head wind, headache and dizziness, all of which may be accompanied by redness or pain of the eyes. These symptoms reflect disharmony of both coupled channels.

The Small Intestine channel is paired with the Bladder channel (taiyang) according to six channel theory. This Heart-Small Intestine-Bladder linkage has traditionally been used to explain the relationship between Heart disharmony and urinary disorders, since heat can transmit from the Heart to the Small Intestine and thence to the Bladder, and in the case of Tōnglǐ HE-5 its ability to treat enuresis due to accumulation of heat in the Bladder.

The Heart governs blood, whilst according to the Essential Questions11 "The bao mai [uterine channel] pertains to the Heart and is connected with the uterus". If, due to emotional factors, heat accumulates in the Heart and enters the blood, there may be uterine bleeding or menorrhagia due to reckless movement of the blood. Tōnglǐ HE-5 is the only point on the Heart channel with such gynaecological indications.

Finally the Essential Questions gives specific indications for excess and deficiency of the luo-connecting points. In the case of Tōnglǐ HE-5 these are: fullness and distention of the chest and diaphragm radiating to the lateral costal region (excess); and inability to speak (deficiency).

Summary of clinical application
Has a strong action on the emotional aspect of the spirit: frequent yawning and groaning with sadness, restless zang disorder (see Língdào HE-4), vexation and anger, sadness and fright, depressive disorder. “Tōnglǐ HE-5 treats a frightenable Heart” (Ode of the Jade Dragon).
Regulates the rhythm of the Heart: palpitations, fright palpitations, pounding of the Heart, disorders of Heart rhythm, diminished qi.
The luo-channel ascends to the tongue and eye: sudden loss of voice, inability to speak, stuttering, stiffness of the tongue, eye pain. Much used clinically for speech disorders following windstroke.
The luo-channel connects with the Small Intestine channel: head wind, headache and dizziness, visual dizziness.
