  location_description: At the wrist joint, between the tendons of palmaris longus
    and flexor carpi radialis, level with Sh√©nm√©n HE-7.
  location_notes: i. This point is commonly described as being at the wrist crease,
    which is variable. It is more reliably located level with Sh√©nm√©n HE-7 which lies
    at the proximal border of the pisiform bone; ii. In the absence of the tendon
    of palmaris longus, locate this point on the ulnar side of the tendon of flexor
    carpi radialis.
  needling_method: i. Perpendicular insertion 0.3 to 0.5 cun; ii. Oblique distal insertion
    along the carpal tunnel for carpal tunnel syndrome, 0.5 to 1 cun.
  needling_depth: 0.3 to 0.5 cun
  needling_cautions:
  - the median nerve lies directly under this point and needling commonly induces
    a significant electric sensation. This is an acceptable manifestation of deqi
    (arrival of qi), but once elicited, further manipulation is inappropriate and
    may damage the nerve.

## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

D√†l√≠ng P-7 is the shu-stream, yuan-source and earth point of the Pericardium channel. The Classic of Difficulties10 states "in cases of deficiency reinforce the mother, in cases of excess reduce the child". The Pericardium channel belongs to fire, and as the earth (child) point of a fire (mother) channel D√†l√≠ng P-7 is able to reduce excess heat or fire from the Pericardium.

The Pericardium is known as the 'wrapping' of the Heart, and like most points of the Pericardium channel, D√†l√≠ng P-7 has a profound action on the Heart and spirit. So close was the relationship between the Pericardium and Heart perceived to be, that the Spiritual Pivot listed only five zang (omitting the Pericardium entirely as a discrete zang) whilst describing the Pericardium channel as the channel pertaining to the Heart. Thus, for example, D√†l√≠ng P-7 rather than Sh√©nm√©n HE-7 was listed as the yuan-source point of the Heart.

D√†l√≠ng P-7 is indicated in a wide variety of emotional disorders and is especially used whenever heat rises to disturb the spirit, whether due to: i. excess of any of the seven emotions transforming into fire; ii. stagnation of qi which both impairs the circulation of body fluids and transforms into fire resulting in phlegm-fire which harasses the Heart; iii. febrile heat collapsing into the Pericardium; iv.. blazing heat arising from deficiency of yin. When the spirit is disrupted in this way it will give rise to such symptoms as palpitations, agitation, epilepsy, mania, manic raving, restlessness, insomnia, and anxiety. Under its alternative name of Guixin (Ghost Heart) D√†l√≠ng P-7 was included by Sun Si-miao among his 'thirteen ghost points' for the treatment of mania disorder and epilepsy.

The relationship of excessive laughter to Heart fire has long been recognised, for example Gong Tian-xian in Achieving Longevity by Guarding the Source stated "Ceaseless laughter is due to blazing of Heart fire". However as long ago as the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic it was recognised that extravagant joy and deep sadness were equally manifestations of a disordered Heart spirit. Thus the Spiritual Pivot11 says "The Heart rules the vessels, the vessels are the residence of the spirit, when Heart qi is deficient there is sadness, when excess there is ceaseless laughter", whilst the Essential Questions12 states "The Heart stores the spirit ... when the spirit is in excess there is ceaseless laughter, when the spirit is insufficient there is sadness". The fact that D√†l√≠ng P-7 is indicated not only for ceaseless laughter but also for sadness and weeping with grief, reflects its application in both excess and deficiency disorders of the spirit.

If Heart fire transmits to its interiorly-exteriorly coupled Small Intestine channel, and from the Small Intestine (hand taiyang channel) to the Bladder (foot taiyang channel) and thence to the Bladder fu, there may be difficult and bloody urination, both indications for this point.

The Pericardium is interiorly-exteriorly coupled with the Sanjiao channel, whilst the interior pathway of the Pericardium primary and divergent channels pass through the middle and lower jiao. D√†l√≠ng P-7 therefore, like many points of the Pericardium channel, is used to harmonise the Stomach and intestines, especially when fire causes the Stomach qi to rebel upwards with symptoms such as foul breath, epigastric pain, vomiting, vomiting of blood, and sudden turmoil disorder.

The Pericardium (hand jueyin) channel and its coupled Liver (foot jueyin) channel are said to 'share the same qi'. This has special significance in relation to the actions of D√†l√≠ng P-7 in clearing heat from the Heart, calming the spirit and harmonising the Stomach and intestines. Liver qi stagnation may either transform to fire and rise to disturb the Heart and spirit, or transversely invade the Stomach causing Stomach qi to rebel upwards. As a result of the primary focus of D√†l√≠ng P-7 on the upper jiao, its special relationship to the Liver, and the pathway of the Pericardium sinew channel to the anterior ribs, D√†l√≠ng P-7 is also used to unbind the qi of the chest and treat such symptoms as fullness of the chest, shortness of breath, pain of the chest and lateral costal region, sighing and breast pain.

In common with several other points of the channel, D√†l√≠ng P-7 is indicated when febrile disease penetrates to the nutritive and especially the blood levels, agitating the Pericardium and spirit and giving rise to symptoms such as fever with agitation, cracked tongue, insomnia and even mania. This action of D√†l√≠ng P-7 on cooling the blood level further explains its use in the treatment of eczema, wind rash and carbuncles and furuncles. Finally D√†l√≠ng P-7 is the principal point used in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome, in which case the needle is inserted obliquely and distally along the carpal tunnel.

Summary of clinical application
