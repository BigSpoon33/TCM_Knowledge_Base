  location_description: "On the forehead, directly above Y√°ngb√°i GB-14, 0.5 cun within the anterior hairline, midway between Sh√©nt√≠ng DU-24 and T√≥uw√©i ST-8."
  location_notes: "The distance between the anterior and posterior hairlines in the midline is measured as 12 cun. If the anterior hairline is indistinct, the distance is measured as 15 cun between the glabella [point Y√¨nt√°ng M-HN-3] and the posterior hairline; the location of the anterior hairline would thus be defined as one fifth of this distance. If the posterior hairline is indistinct, it can be measured as 1 cun inferior to Fƒìngf«î DU-16 which lies immediately below the external occipital protuberance. Note that the line of the anterior hairline away from the midline usually curves somewhat posteriorly, and this should be taken into account when locating the Gall Bladder points on the scalp (T√≥ul√≠nq√¨ GB-15 to N«éok≈çng GB-19)."

## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

As its name (Head Governor of Tears) implies, T√≥ul√≠nq√¨ GB-15 is indicated for lacrimation as well as for redness and pain of the eyes and superficial visual obstruction. In this respect it mirrors Zulinqi Gb 41 (Foot Governor of Tears) towards the distal end of the channel. Like several other points on the crown of the head (e.g. T≈çngtiƒÅn BL-7 and Sh√†ngxƒ´ng DU-23) it also has a pronounced action on the nose and is indicated for nasal congestion.

Summary of clinical application
For lacrimation, redness and pain of the eyes, superficial visual obstruction, nasal congestion.
