## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Xi«éoch√°ngsh≈´ BL-27 is the back-shu point of the Small Intestine fu, where the qi of the Small Intestine emanates from the interior to the body surface. According to Introduction to Medicine by Li Ting of the Ming dynasty "The Small Intestine separates the pure from the turbid; the water enters the upper opening of the Bladder and the dregs enter the upper opening of the Large Intestine". This quotation emphasises the role of the Small Intestine as an intermediary between the Stomach which 'rots and ripens' solid and liquid food, and the Large Intestine and Bladder which eliminate solid and liquid waste respectively. It is the Small Intestine which controls this process of separating the pure from the turbid. Although Xiao-Xi«éoch√°ngsh≈´ BL-27 is the back-shu point of the Small Intestine fu, therefore, its clinical action extends both to the Large Intestine and the Bladder.

In intestinal disorders it primarily drains turbid dampness and clears damp-heat and can be used in the treatment of diarrhoea, dysenteric disorder and blood and mucus in the stools due to this aetiology. Xi«éoch√°ngsh≈´ BL-27 may also be used for constipation, and for haemorrhoids and accompanying pain.

In disorders of the Bladder it also drains dampness and damp-heat and clears heat transmitted from the Heart (interiorly-exteriorly coupled with the Small Intestine), being indicated in the treatment of dark yellow urine, enuresis, retention of urine, blood in the urine and agitation of the Heart. Following the principle that dampness and damp-heat may be drained from the body via urination, Xi«éoch√°ngsh≈´ BL-27 is also indicated for damp-heat affecting other portions of the lower jiao with symptoms such as leucorrhoea and seminal emission. If damp-heat sinks to the lower limbs there may be swelling of the feet.

Finally, Xi«éoch√°ngsh≈´ BL-27 may be used in the treatment of the pattern of Small Intestine qi pain. This form of painful shan disorder which may arise due to improper diet, stagnation of Liver qi or exposure to cold, leads to obstruction in the circulation of qi in the Small Intestine. Its characteristic symptoms are lower abdominal pain or testicular pain that may radiate to the lumbar region.
