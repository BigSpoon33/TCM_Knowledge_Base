## 📍 Location

At the wrist joint, in the depression between the radial artery and the tendon of abductor pollicis longus, level with Shénmén HE-7 (the proximal border of the pisiform bone).

The location of this point is normally given in relation to the crease of the wrist. Since wrist creases are a superficial and variable anatomical feature, it is better to locate this point in relation to the nearby pisiform bone: first locate Shénmén HE-7 at the lower (proximal) border of the pisiform bone, then find Tàiyuān LU-9 at the same level.

## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Tàiyuān LU-9 is the shu-stream, yuan-source and earth point of the Lung channel. The Spiritual Pivot in Chapter Six, recommends the use of the shu-stream points in the treatment of disorders of the zang, whilst in Chapter 1 it says "When the five zang are diseased, select [from] the twelve yuan-source [points]". Furthermore, the Classic of Difficulties20 states "in cases of deficiency reinforce the mother" (according to five phase theory Tàiyuān LU-9 is the earth, and thus mother, point of the metal zang). Tàiyuān LU-9 therefore is the single most important point on the Lung channel to tonify the Lung qi or yin, the two principal patterns of Lung deficiency.

Tàiyuān LU-9 is indicated for Lung deficiency characterised by chronic weak coughing or wheezing. In the case of Lung qi deficiency there may also be shortness of breath and much yawning, whilst in the case of Lung yin deficiency there may be heat in the palms and spitting of blood. Tàiyuān LU-9 will also assist in the transformation of phlegm which arises due to deficiency. If Lung qi is too weak to move the fluids in the Lung there may be copious watery phlegm, whilst if Lung yin is deficient, and the consequent heat condenses the fluids, there may be scanty dry phlegm with dryness of the throat. As well as tonifying deficiency, Tàiyuān LU-9 is able to promote the descending function of the Lung and is indicated for fullness and oppression of the chest with inability to lie down.

According to the Classic of Difficulties21 "the vessels gather at Tàiyuān LU-9", whilst the Classic of Categories states "The flow of the channels [must] follow the qi, the qi is dominated by the Lung, therefore it is the meeting of the hundred vessels". These statements refer to the important relationship between the qi and the blood, expressed in the saying "The qi is the commander of blood", and the further statement in the Classic of Categories that "The vessels are the pathways of the blood qi; the circulation of the vessels is dependent on qi". In other words, the blood moves through the blood vessels by virtue of the movement of qi, and in the chest and Heart region especially, the circulation of the blood is dependent on the gathering qi [formed from the combination of air inhaled by the Lung and the grain qi of food and drink]. Tàiyuān LU-9, the hui-meeting point of the vessels, is therefore an important point to harmonise the relationship between the gathering qi and the blood. When the gathering qi is deficient and fails to circulate the blood, it will pool and stagnate in the chest and Heart, giving rise to oppression and fullness, agitation, Heart pain with a choppy pulse, and in severe cases manic raving. Tàiyuān LU-9 is further indicated for disorders of the blood vessels in general such as vomiting, spitting or coughing blood and pulseless syndrome.

The Lung channel has its origin in the middle jiao, and in common with many points of the channel Tàiyuān LU-9 is able to harmonise the Stomach, being indicated for rebellion of Stomach qi with belching, as well as for Stomach channel heat symptoms such as toothache, superficial visual obstruction, redness and pain of the eyes and breast pain.

Finally, Tàiyuān LU-9 is indicated for pain affecting various portions of the Lung channel including the supraclavicular fossa, the shoulder and back, the inner aspect of the arm and the wrist. It should be noted that the Chinese reference to the 'inner' aspect of the arm in respect of the Lung channel assumes a standing posture with the palms hanging facing the sides. In terms of the Western anatomical position used throughout this book, the Lung channel occupies the antero-lateral position on the arm.
