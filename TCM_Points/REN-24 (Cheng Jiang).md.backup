## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Chéngjiāng REN-24 is a meeting point of the Conception vessel with the hand and foot yangming channels (Large Intestine and Stomach). Yangming channel dominates the facial region, Chéngjiāng REN-24 is located just inferior to the mouth and the Conception vessel itself winds around the mouth, connects with the Governing vessel at Yínjiāo DU-28 and terminates below the eye at Chéngqì ST-1. The principal clinical application of Chéngjiāng REN-24, therefore, is in the treatment of facial disorders, especially pain and numbness of the face and deviation of the mouth and eye (i.e. facial paralysis). Facial paralysis may be due either to exterior wind, which attacks and obstructs the channels of the face, or to interior wind which stirs upwards and leads to malnourishment of the channels. These two patterns correspond more or less exactly to peripheral and central nervous system facial paralysis in modern medicine. In the treatment of this disorder, Chéngjiāng REN-24 is usually joined by through-needling to points such as Dìcāng ST-4 or Jiáchē ST-6. The ability of Chéngjiāng REN-24 to extinguish wind, especially in the region of the face and jaw, extends to the treatment of hemiplegia, lockjaw and epilepsy.

As its name 'Contain Fluid' implies, Chéngjiāng REN-24 is able to affect the production of fluids in the mouth and is indicated for excessive production of watery saliva, dry mouth and wasting and thirsting disorder with great desire to drink.

Chéngjiāng REN-24 is a meeting point of the Conception and Governing vessels and lies directly opposite the neck which is traversed by the Governing vessel. A number of classics, for example the Ode of the Essentials of Understanding, recommend it for stiffness and pain of the nape of the neck.

As the terminal point of the Conception vessel, Chéngjiāng REN-24 is indicated for disorders of the lower portion of the channel such as dark urination, shan disorder in men and abdominal masses in women. Finally, Chéngjiāng REN-24 was included under its alternative name Guishi (Ghost Market) by Sun Si-miao among his 'thirteen ghost points' for the treatment of epilepsy and mania-depression.

Summary of clinical application
Mainly used for facial disorders: pain and numbness of the face (including trigeminal neuralgia), deviation of the mouth and eye (i.e. facial paralysis).
For excessive production of watery saliva, dry mouth, wasting and thirsting disorder with great desire to drink.
For stiffness and pain of the nape of the neck.
