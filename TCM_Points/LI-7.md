## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Wēnliū L.I.-7 is the xi-cleft point of the Large Intestine channel. The xi-cleft points are where the qi and blood, which flow relatively superficially along the channels from the jing-well points, gather and plunge more deeply. The xi-cleft points in general are indicated in the treatment of acute conditions and pain, and this is reflected in the ability of Wēnliū L.I.-7 to clear heat and detoxify poison in cases of clove sores, carbuncles and furuncles, throat painful obstruction, and heat and swelling of the face. Clove sores are small hard deep-rooted clove-shaped purulent lesions. They are primarily due to unregulated diet or external wind and fire poison which invade the superficial portion of the body. The condition tends to develop very rapidly with severe localised pain, redness and swelling, often accompanied by fever.

One notable feature of the hand yang channels (Large Intestine, Sanjiao and Small Intestine) is that relatively few of their points treat disorders of their corresponding fu. As far as the Large Intestine channel is concerned, Wēnliū L.I.-7 and its following points Xiàlián L.I.-8 and Shànglián L.I.-9, however, are indicated for disorders of the intestines and Stomach (in the case of Wēnliū L.I.-7 for borborygmus accompanied by abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and vomiting of foam or watery saliva). This follows the general principle of all the yang channels, most clearly seen on the leg yang, that as the points approach the elbow or knee they begin to have a greater action on their corresponding fu. It should be noted, however, that in clinical practice points of the Large Intestine channel are rarely used for disorders of the intestines, and this is borne out by the absence of Wēnliū L.I.-7 in combinations for this purpose in any of the major classics.

The action of Wēnliū L.I.-7 on clearing yangming fire and calming the spirit, and thus treating frequent laughter, raving and 'seeing ghosts', is similar to that of Yángxī L.I.-5.

Summary of clinical application
Xi-cleft point for acute heat and fire-poison: redness, swelling and pain of the face, clove sores (small, hard, deep-rooted, clove-shaped purulent lesions), carbuncles and furuncles, pain of the teeth and mouth.
Regulates the intestines and Stomach: borborygmus, abdominal distention and pain, vomiting watery saliva and foam.
Not commonly used clinically.
