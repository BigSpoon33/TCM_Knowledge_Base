## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Bìguān ST-31 (Thigh Gate) is located close to the pivotal hip region, the 'gate' of the lower limb. According to the Spiritual Pivot19 "Yangming channel is abundant in qi and blood", and points of both arm and foot yangming channel are much used clinically to promote the circulation of qi and blood in the extremities, rendering them ideal for treating numbness, paralysis, stiffness and pain in the four limbs.

Bìguān ST-31 is an important point to regulate the circulation of qi and blood in the leg as a whole, and in the Stomach channel in particular. In this respect it may be viewed as the equivalent point on the lower limb of Jiānyú L.I.-15 on the upper limb. Its main applications are in the treatment of atrophy disorder, hemiplegia and painful obstruction of the whole leg, or in the treatment of pain from the hip radiating down the Stomach channel. In such cases it is frequently combined in the 'chain and lock' method with Zúsānlǐ ST-36 and Jiěxī ST-41. A number of classics also specifically recommend Bìguān ST-31 for cold painful obstruction of the knees and for lumbar pain.

Summary of clinical application
Regulates the circulation of qi and blood in the whole leg (yangming channel is rich in qi and blood): atrophy disorder and painful obstruction, hemiplegia, pain of the hip joint, numbness of the legs, thigh pain and contraction of the thigh muscles, cold painful obstruction of the knee, inability to extend and bend the knee.
Commonly combined with Zúsānlǐ ST-36 and Jiěxī ST-41 for disorders of the whole leg, e.g. hemiplegia.
