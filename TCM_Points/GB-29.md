## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Jūliáo GB-29 is very commonly used in clinical practice in the treatment of hip disorders, and is especially indicated when pain radiates from the hip to the groin and lower abdomen. Correct needling will ensure radiation of sensation to these areas.

In the cross-needling method of point selection, the shoulder joint in the upper body corresponds to the hip joint in the lower body, and Jūliáo GB-29 is not only indicated for hip pain radiating forward to the groin, but also for shoulder pain radiating forward to the chest.
