## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

W√®ish≈´ BL-21 is the back-shu point of the Stomach fu, where the qi of the Stomach emanates from the interior to the body surface, and is a powerful point to treat all diseases of the Stomach, as well as to regulate the middle jiao as a whole. According to the Spiritual Pivot34 "The Stomach is the sea of water and grain". Its function is to receive food and drink, 'rot and ripen' it and descend it to the Small Intestine. Most pathology of the Stomach, therefore, involves impairment of its descending function. This may be due to deficiency of Stomach qi or Stomach yin, excessive cold, heat or dampness whether of internal or external origin, stasis of blood in the Stomach, stagnation of food, or invasion of the Stomach by Liver or Gall Bladder qi. Failure of the Stomach descending function leads to stagnation of qi and hence distention, fullness and pain of the epigastrium and abdomen, whilst upward rebellion of the Stomach qi leads to Stomach reflux, nausea and vomiting. Whatever the pattern, whether deficient, excess, hot or cold, W√®ish≈´ BL-21 is a primary point to re-establish harmony of the Stomach.

It is interesting to compare the actions and indications of W√®ish≈´ BL-21, the back-shu point of the Stomach, with Z√∫sƒÅnl«ê ST-36 the he-sea point of the Stomach channel. Both have an equally strong action on regulating disorders of the Stomach fu, but W√®ish≈´ BL-21 shares none of the ability of Z√∫sƒÅnl«ê ST-36 to tonify and nourish the qi and blood of the body as a whole.

The Stomach and Spleen are interiorly-exteriorly related, and the descending of Stomach qi and the ascending of Spleen qi together dominate the whole process of digestion. By virtue of this close relationship, W√®ish≈´ BL-21 is able to regulate disharmony of both the Stomach and Spleen, giving rise to abnormal ascent of Stomach qi (vomiting), abnormal descent of Spleen qi (diarrhoea) and failure of the Spleen transportation and transformation function (borborygmus and oedema).

A healthy appetite is a sign of the harmonious functioning of both the Spleen and Stomach, and W√®ish≈´ BL-21 is indicated in various disorders affecting the appetite. Poor appetite may be due either to deficiency of the Stomach and Spleen which lack the force to 'rot and ripen' and transport and transform what is eaten, or to various forms of excess which lead to stagnation of food in the Stomach and hence lack of desire and inability to take in more food. Hunger with inability to eat is due to insufficiency of Stomach yin with consequent deficiency heat, the heat stimulating desire to eat, the yin deficiency and resultant dryness causing inability to digest what is eaten. Excessive eating without gaining weight is a sign of Stomach heat, with or without Spleen deficiency (see commentary on P√≠sh≈´ BL-20). W√®ish≈´ BL-21 is indicated in all such cases.

Summary of clinical application
Treats all patterns of Stomach disharmony whether deficient or excess, hot or cold: epigastric pain, distention and cold of the Stomach, cold and feeble Stomach, distention and fullness of the abdomen and epigastrium, thin body despite much eating, hungry but unable to eat, lack of appetite, vomiting, vomiting clear fluid, vomiting in the morning what was eaten the evening before, Stomach reflux, childhood nutritional impairment, regurgitation of milk in children.
