## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The Classic of Difficulties74 states "in cases of deficiency reinforce the mother, in cases of excess reduce the child". Shùgǔ BL-65 is the wood point of the Bladder channel, and according to the 'mother-child' theory is able to reduce excess in the Bladder channel (wood is the 'child' of Bladder water), especially fullness and heat in the head region. The Bladder channel ascends from the inner canthus over the vertex, connects with points of the Governing vessel and Gall Bladder channel on the head, and descends through the occipital region and neck. Shùgǔ BL-65, consequently, is indicated for redness and pain of the eyes and inner canthus, headache (especially in the occipital region) and stiff neck.

The heat clearing action of Shùgǔ BL-65 extends to resolving fever, especially due to injury by wind, and to draining heat from the anal region in the treatment of haemorrhoids. Like Wěizhōng BL-40, Shùgǔ BL-65 is also indicated for carbuncular swellings on the back and for clove sores (small, hard, clove-shaped purulent lesions).

Summary of clinical application
Clears fullness and heat from the head: redness and pain of the eyes and inner canthus, headache (especially occipital), stiff neck.
Clears heat: fever, haemorrhoids, carbuncular swellings on the back, clove sores.
