## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The name of this point (Man’s Middle) reflects the location of this point close to the junction of the Governing and Conception vessels, and between the nose and mouth. The Governing vessel which governs all the yang channels, and the nose which receives heavenly qi, both correspond to heaven (yang). The Conception vessel which governs all the yin channels, and the mouth which receives earthly sustenance, both correspond to earth (yin). According to Chinese cosmology ‘man’ lies between heaven and earth, and Renzhong DU-26 is considered to establish connection between the two.

When the harmonious interaction of yin and yang is lost and they begin to separate, there is loss of consciousness (death being the ultimate manifestation of this separation). Renzhong DU-26 (along with Neiguan P-6) was one of two points added by later commentators to Gao Wu’s ‘four command points’ to make the ‘six command points’. In this grouping of the most essential acupuncture points, Renzhong DU-26 was indicated for resuscitation, and it is the single most important acupuncture point to revive consciousness and re-establish yin-yang harmony. In any kind of fainting or loss of consciousness, including needle shock, Renzhong DU-26 may be needled or strongly pressed (obliquely upwards towards the root of the nose). The Ode of the Golden Needle specifically recommends needling Renzhong DU-26 and Zusanli ST-36 for dizziness following needling (needle shock).

The powerful effect of Renzhong DU-26 on restoring consciousness is mirrored in its equally strong effect on calming the mind. The Governing vessel both enters the brain and connects (via its anterior pathway) with the Heart. Renzhong DU-26 is an important point in the treatment of severe psycho-emotional disorders, and is indicated in classical texts for unexpected and inappropriate laughter and crying. The importance of Renzhong DU-26 in the treatment of mania disorder and epilepsy is reflected in its inclusion under its alternative name of Guigong (Ghost Palace) among the ‘thirteen ghost points’ of Sun Si-miao for the treatment of mania disorder and epilepsy. According to the Ode of Xi-hong “the ability of Renzhong DU-26 to treat mania disorder is supreme; the thirteen ghost points must not be overlooked”.

Renzhong DU-26 is a meeting point of the Governing vessel with the hand and foot yangming (Large Intestine and Stomach) channels which dominate the face and nose. It is therefore indicated for various disorders of the nose, including blockage, discharge, bleeding and loss of sense of smell, as well as swelling of the face and wind disorders such as deviation of the face and mouth and lockjaw.

According to the Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic50 “When the disease is below select [points] from above”. Renzhong DU-26, located close to the termination of the Governing vessel, is therefore an important point clinically in the treatment of sprain of the lumbar spine, traversed by the lower portion of the Governing vessel and close to its origin. It is normally selected when the pain is acute and on the midline, and needled whilst the patient stands and rotates and bends the waist.

Summary of clinical application
Principal point to restore consciousness in any situation including needle shock (by needling or finger pressure).
Important point in the treatment of severe psycho-emotional disorders: mania-depression, epilepsy, inappropriate laughter, unexpected laughter and crying.
For acute lumbar sprain, especially on the midline of the back.
