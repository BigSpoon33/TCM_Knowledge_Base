## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The point Yīnmén BL-37 is frequently found to be tender on palpation in patients with sciatica, and is therefore commonly needled in the treatment of this condition. It is especially used when more proximal points such as Huántiào GB-30 or Zhìbiān BL-54 fail to elicit propagated sensation extending down the leg.

Summary of clinical application
Commonly needled, especially when tender, in sciatica with pain radiating down the Bladder channel from the buttock.
Also indicated for pain and rigidity of the lumbar spine, painful obstruction and atrophy disorder of the lower limb.
