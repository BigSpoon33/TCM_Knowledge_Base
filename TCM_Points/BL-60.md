## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 is the fire point of the taiyang Bladder channel and an important point to clear and descend excess wind, fire and yang from the upper part of the body. To best understand the actions of this point, three factors should be taken into account: i. as a fire point, K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 is able to clear heat, fire and excess yang; ii. taiyang (supreme yang) channel is the most yang of the six channels; iii. K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 is located on the foot, towards the inferior end of the Bladder channel which traverses the entire posterior (yang) portion of the body.

The principle "for diseases of the head select [points from] the feet" applies well to this point. K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 is able to clear heat and lead down excess yang from the head in cases of headache, heat in the head, redness, pain and swelling of the eyes, bursting eye pain, nosebleed and toothache, and to extinguish wind from the head in cases of epilepsy and lockjaw. Indeed as long ago as the third century CE the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion stated that K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 "drains wind from the head to the feet". Although K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 is principally used clinically in the treatment of occipital headache, it is worth noting that the primary Bladder channel meets the Governing vessel and the Gall Bladder channel at B«éihu√¨ DU-20 on the vertex, Sh√©nt√≠ng DU-24 and T√≥ul√≠nq√¨ GB-15 towards the front of the head, and points Q≈´b√¨n GB-7 through to W√°ng«î GB-12 on the side of the head. For this reason, K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 may be considered for pain in any region of the head.

It is interesting that many of the indications of this point, characterised by uprising of yang, flaring up of fire and stirring of wind, suggest a clinical picture of Liver disharmony. Whilst K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 has no direct action on the Liver, and is therefore unable to treat the root of such disorders, it has a profound action on subduing the manifestations. At the same time, there is a parallel between K≈´nl√∫n BL-60, the fire point of the 'supreme yang' channel, and the fierce, indomitable and strong quality of Liver yang.

The ability of K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 to activate the entire length of the Bladder channel as well as to relax the sinews and strengthen the lumbar spine, renders it an essential point in the treatment of pain and contraction anywhere along the channel. It is the foremost distal point in the treatment of occipital headache and is often combined with H√≤uxƒ´ SI-3 for this purpose. It is equally vital in the treatment of disorders of the back and spine from the neck right down to the coccyx. K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 is one of the few distal points which are able to treat disorders of the middle and upper back, again often combined with H√≤uxƒ´ SI-3. It is specifically indicated for Heart pain that radiates from the chest through to the upper back, reflecting the pathway of the Bladder divergent channel to the Heart. In disorders of the lumbar region, in which Kidney deficiency is often the root, K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 may be joined by through-needling to T√†ixƒ´ KID-3. Ma Dan-yang, the great physician of the Jin dynasty, listed K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 as one of the 'eleven heavenly star points'70 "for cramping of the lumbar region and sacrum ... inability to walk or even take a step, as soon as he moves he groans". K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 is equally valuable in treating obstruction of the Bladder channel in the lower limbs, especially in cases of sciatic pain radiating down the back of the leg, and is often combined with points such as Ch√©ngf√∫ BL-36 and Wƒõizh≈çng BL-40 in the 'chain and lock' point association method. In the ankle region, K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 is an important point for pain and stiffness, and like several distal points of the Bladder channel it is able to treat pain of the heel.

The ability of K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 to promote labour is another reflection both of the strong descending action of this point, and of the paired relationship of the Bladder and the Kidneys, which dominate the uterus. It may be used, in combination with points such as H√©g«î L.I.-4, Zh√¨yƒ´n BL-67 and SƒÅnyƒ´njiƒÅo SP-6, to induce labour, hasten prolonged labour, control pain and promote the expulsion of the placenta. For this reason K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 is contraindicated in pregnancy. The Great Compendium of Acupuncture & Moxibustion somewhat surprisingly however, also suggests this point for difficult conception.

Finally, it is interesting to note that K≈´nl√∫n BL-60 is indicated for fullness of the chest, dyspnoea and cough. Whilst these indications have no apparent relationship to the Bladder channel, they do reflect the ability of jing-river points, according to the Classic of Difficulties71, to treat dyspnoea and cough.
