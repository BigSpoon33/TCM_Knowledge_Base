  special_properties:
  - Meeting point of the Gall Bladder and Bladder channels with the Yang Linking vessel
  location_description: On the forehead, directly above Yángbái GB-14, 0.5 cun within
    the anterior hairline, midway between Shéntíng DU-24 and Tóuwéi ST-8.
  location_notes: The distance between the anterior and posterior hairlines in the
    midline is measured as 12 cun. If the anterior hairline is indistinct, the distance
    is measured as 15 cun between the glabella [point Yìntáng M-HN-3] and the posterior
    hairline; the location of the anterior hairline would thus be defined as one fifth
    of this distance. If the posterior hairline is indistinct, it can be measured
    as 1 cun inferior to Fēngfǔ DU-16 which lies immediately below the external occipital
    protuberance. Note that the line of the anterior hairline away from the midline
    usually curves somewhat posteriorly, and this should be taken into account when
    locating the Gall Bladder points on the scalp (Tóulínqì GB-15 to Nǎokōng GB-19).

## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

As its name (Head Governor of Tears) implies, Tóulínqì GB-15 is indicated for lacrimation as well as for redness and pain of the eyes and superficial visual obstruction. In this respect it mirrors Zulinqi Gb 41 (Foot Governor of Tears) towards the distal end of the channel. Like several other points on the crown of the head (e.g. Tōngtiān BL-7 and Shàngxīng DU-23) it also has a pronounced action on the nose and is indicated for nasal congestion.

Summary of clinical application
For lacrimation, redness and pain of the eyes, superficial visual obstruction, nasal congestion.
