## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Nāoshū SI-10 is a commonly used point for pain and stiffness of the shoulder, especially its posterior aspect, and allows deep penetration into the joint. Its influence on the shoulder is augmented by the fact that Nāoshū SI-10 is also a meeting point of the Yang Motility and Yang Linking vessels, which traverse the posterior (Yang Linking) and the superior and anterior (Yang Motility) portions of the shoulder. In clinical practice Nāoshū SI-10 is often used in combination with points such as Jiānyú L.I.-15 and Jiānliáo SJ-14.

Summary of clinical application
Frequently used local point for disorders of the shoulder, scapula and upper arm. Meeting point of three channels which traverse the shoulder joint, the Small Intestine channel (posterior shoulder), the Yang Linking vessel (posterior shoulder) and the Yang Motility vessel (anterior and superior shoulder).
