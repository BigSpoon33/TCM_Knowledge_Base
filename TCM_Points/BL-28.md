## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Pángguāngshū BL-28 is the back-shu point of the Bladder fu, where the qi of the Bladder emanates from the interior to the body surface. Its principal action is to drain damp-heat excess from the Bladder and genital system. Bladder damp-heat may be due to: i. invasion of exterior pathogenic factors (damp-heat or cold damp which transforms to heat), especially as a result of inadequate clothing or sitting on damp ground; ii. excessive consumption of foods that generate damp-heat (spicy, greasy, sweet, alcohol etc.); iii. Heart fire which transmits downwards via the Small Intestine to the Bladder; iv. Liver damp-heat which pours downwards to the Bladder; or v. excessive sexual activity or inadequate hygiene. Bladder damp-heat typically manifests as painful, difficult, hesitant and frequent urination with scanty dark flow. As the Bladder back-shu point, Pángguāngshū BL-28 has a direct action on the Bladder fu and is not only a vital point to drain Bladder damp-heat but is more widely used for any kind of urinary disorder.

The use of Pángguāngshū BL-28 is not confined to the Bladder however. It is an important treatment principle of Chinese medicine that damp-heat anywhere in the body, and most especially in the lower jiao, is best eliminated by draining via urination. Pángguāngshū BL-28, by its action of promoting urination, is therefore indicated for damp-heat affecting i. the intestinal region giving rise to diarr-hoea, and ii. the genital region giving rise to such symptoms as swelling and pain of the external genitals, genital ulceration and damp itching, swelling and pain of the vagina etc.

A second important action of Pángguāngshū BL-28 is in the treatment of a variety of disorders of the lumbar region, sacrum, buttocks, and coccyx as well as the lower limbs, and it may equally be used for excess or deficient disorders of these regions. It is classically indicated for the treatment of 'wind-taxation' lumbar pain (for a fuller discussion see Guānyuánshú BL-26), as well as for weakness of the leg and knee, seminal emission and diminished qi. These indications reflect the fact that as the back-shu point of the Bladder, Pángguāngshū BL-28 has some action of strengthening the Kidneys. As far as excess disorders of the lumbar region and legs are concerned, it is especially indicated for back pain, atrophy disorder and heaviness of the legs due to damp-heat.

Finally Pángguāngshū BL-28 is able to resolve stagnation in the lower abdomen (abdominal pain, difficult defecation, constipation, abdominal fullness) and to resolve abdominal (jia ju) masses in women as well as hard abdominal (ji ju) masses.

Summary of clinical application
Drains damp-heat from the Bladder and lower jiao: difficult urination, dark urination with unsmooth flow, retention of urine, enuresis, turbid painful urinary dysfunction, swelling and pain of the external genitals, genital ulceration, damp itching, diarrhoea, diarrhoea with abdominal pain.
Moves stagnation: difficult defecation, constipation, abdominal fullness, abdominal masses in women, hard abdominal masses.
Treats the lower back and legs: stiffness and pain of the lumbar spine, sacrum, buttock and coccyx, difficulty in bending, inability to sit for long, weakness of the leg and knee, cold and contraction of the lower leg, numbness of the leg, atrophy disorder and heaviness of the leg, sciatica.
