## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

R√°ng«î KID-2 'Blazing Valley' is the ying-spring and fire point of the Kidney channel. According to the Classic of Difficulties6 ying-spring points are indicated for "heat in the body", and in the case of most ying-spring points the emphasis is on clearing excess heat and fire. The Kidneys are unique, however, in that they do not suffer from excess patterns, since the Kidneys store true yin and true yang which can never be in a state of real excess. R√°ng«î KID-2, therefore, is the principal Kidney channel point to clear heat deriving from Kidney yin deficiency.

The Kidneys are the root of the yin and yang of the body. Kidney yin has the functions of nourishing and moistening as well as balancing and restraining the ming men fire. When Kidney yin is deficient, its nourishing and moistening functions will be impaired and additionally the ming men fire may blaze out of control. The forte of R√°ng«î KID-2, as its name implies, is to clear this deficiency heat, rather than nourish the Kidney yin. It is indicated when such heat: i. ascends along the Kidney channel to the throat giving rise to throat painful obstruction, dry throat with insufficient saliva and inability to speak, ii. floats to the exterior at night giving rise to night sweating, and iii. disrupts the Lung giving rise to dyspnoea and coughing of blood. Heat from yin deficiency may also manifest as wasting and thirsting disorder and hot and restless feet.

R√°ng«î KID-2 has a particular action on the lower jiao. Deficiency of yin and consequent heat may give rise to genital itching. When Kidney yin fails to nourish the Conception and Penetrating vessels there may be irregular menstruation and infertility in women. When deficiency heat agitates the gate of essence in men there may be seminal emission or nocturnal emissions, with or without dreams. In both men and women there may also be excessive sexual desire. If the Kidney qi is deficient, there may be uterine prolapse.

According to the Complete Works of Jing-yue "Yin and yang are of the same origin ... fire is the ruler of water, water is the source of fire ...". Neither deficiency of Kidney yin nor Kidney yang exist in isolation, and this is reflected in the fact that R√°ng«î KID-2 also clearly has an action on tonifying Kidney yang. This is partly illustrated by the traditional indications, but is reflected most clearly in a variety of classical combinations (see below). R√°ng«î KID-2 therefore may also be treated by moxibustion in cases of spontaneous sweating, coldness of the feet and legs, cold diarrhoea, oedema and impotence.

Finally, the emotion associated with the Kidneys is fear, and when the Kidneys are deficient there may be propensity to fear and fright and a constant feeling of alarm as though one were "about to be apprehended". R√°ng«î KID-2 is indicated for these various feelings of foreboding.

Summary of clinical application
Clears heat deriving from Kidney yin deficiency: throat painful obstruction, dry throat, night sweating, asthma, coughing of blood, wasting and thirsting disorder, hot and restless feet, genital itching, irregular menstruation, infertility, seminal or nocturnal emissions, excessive sexual desire.
Tonifies Kidney yang: spontaneous sweating, coldness of the feet and legs, cold diarrhoea, oedema, impotence.
