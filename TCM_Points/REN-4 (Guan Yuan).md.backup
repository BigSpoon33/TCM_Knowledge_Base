## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Guānyuán REN-4 is one of the principle acupuncture points to promote and foster the original qi, benefit essence, fortify Kidney yang and nourish Kidney yin. As well as Guanyuan (Gate of Origin) several of the numerous different names given to this point reflect its deeply tonifying properties, for example Mingmen (Gate of Life), Huangzhiyuan (Origin of Huang), Xuehai (Sea of Blood), Qihai (Sea of Qi), Dahai (Great Sea) and of course Dantian (Cinnabar Field). According to classical Chinese thought, the lower dantian, located in the lower abdomen and extending from Yīnjiāo REN-7 to Guānyuán REN-4, is the residence of the deepest energies of the body and the source of all movement. According to the Classic of Difficulties 4 "The dynamic qi that moves between the Kidneys is [the basis] of human life, the source of the five zang and six fu, the root of the twelve channels, the door of respiration and the origin of the sanjiao". According to the Discourse into the Origin and Development of Medicine5 "Original qi is distributed to the five zang and forms the essence of the five zang. Where is the place of origin of the original qi? The Daoists believe it is dantian".

Due to its location at the heart of the lower dantian (cinnabar field) and its close relationship with the original qi and hence essence, Guānyuán REN-4 is an indispensable point to tonify and nourish the Kidneys. This action is made abundantly clear by the long list of classical indications which reads like a textbook description of Kidney deficiency. The Kidneys dominate the bones and lumbar region, and Guānyuán REN-4 is indicated for weakness, pain and cold sensations of the lumbar region and legs, especially in the middle-aged and elderly. In severe cases Kidney deficiency may give rise to withered ears, darkness of the complexion and Kidney taxation. According to the Essential Questions 6 "fear depletes the essence". Fear is closely linked to the Kidneys, and prolonged fear may injure and weaken the Kidneys and the essence, whilst Kidney deficiency may render a person prone to deep-seated fear. The powerful effect that fear may have on the body is reflected in classical sources which ascribe even deep-rooted bone ulcers and deficiency consumption to this aetiology. When the Kidneys are deficient and fail to dominate the Bladder there may be urinary frequency or enuresis. In all such cases Guānyuán REN-4 is of fundamental importance. Guānyuán REN-4 is also used for the condition known as running piglet qi, especially when due to Kidney yang deficiency with invasion of cold. According to the Essentials From the Golden Cabinet "Running piglet disorder arises from the lower abdomen; it rushes up to the throat with such ferocity that the patient feels he is close to death. It attacks and then remits. It is brought about by fear and fright". Not only may this pattern be induced by fear, but when the qi rushes upwards in this way it can induce uncontrollable anxiety and panic.

The Spleen controls blood, the Liver stores blood, and the Kidneys and the Conception vessel dominate the uterus and conception. Guānyuán REN-4, also known as Sanjiejiao (Triple Intersection), is a meeting point of the Conception vessel with these three channels and is an essential point to regulate the uterus and promote fertility. When Kidney deficiency leads to deficiency and coldness of what is known as the 'palace of the child' (i.e. the uterus) in women there may be infertility, amenorrhoea and cold leucorrhoea. The importance of this point in assisting conception is reflected in further alternative names, for example Zihu (Infant's Door) and Zigong (Infant's Palace). If deficiency of Kidney fire leads to coldness and weakness of the 'essence gate' in men, there may be seminal emission and impotence.

According to the True Lineage of Medicine 7 "When Kidney origin (yuan) is abundant, then life is long, when Kidney origin (yuan) is in decline, life is short". For this reason, traditional health preservation practitioners in China recommend the regular application of moxibustion to Guānyuán REN-4 in later life.

The strong tonifying and nourishing action of Guānyuán REN-4 is not limited to the Kidneys alone. Since the Kidneys are the root of both the yin and yang of the body, and "the original qi is distributed to the five zang and forms the essence of the five zang", Guānyuán REN-4 may be used in the treatment of any profound deficiency of the zangfu, whether of qi, blood, yin or yang. Thus, for example, when the yin of the Kidneys and Lung is deficient, Guānyuán REN-4 may be used to treat taxation heat, deficiency consumption with cough, tidal fever with coughing of blood, Kidney deficiency dyspnoea, dyspnoea with inability to lie down, and wasting and thirsting disorder. When the Kidney fire fails to provide sufficient heat for the Spleen's transportation and transformation function there may be chronic diarrhoea, incontinence of the stool in the elderly, lethargy, weakness of the four limbs and undigested food (in the stool).

The action of Guānyuán REN-4 is not limited to tonifying deficiency, however. If exterior cold attacks the lower abdomen, and particularly the Liver channel, especially when there is underlying yang deficiency, there may be severe twisting lower abdominal pain radiating to the genitals and sudden painful shan disorder. These symptoms are commonly ascribed to disharmony of the Small Intestine (Small Intestine qi pain), and this is the principal significance of the status of Guānyuán REN-4 as the front-mu point of the Small Intestine.

When damp-heat knots the Bladder there may be various kinds of urinary disorders characterised by frequency, urgency, pain and dark or bloody urination as well as an intense sensation of heat in the hypogastrium. Guānyuán REN-4 may be used to drain these excess pathogenic factors. According to Zhu Dan-xi "When the Kidneys are deficient the Bladder will generate heat", whilst the General Treatise on the Aetiology and Symptomatology of Diseases8 says "Where painful urinary dysfunction is concerned there is Kidney deficiency and Bladder heat". Guānyuán REN-4 is especially indicated when, as is commonly the case, deficiency and excess co-exist and there is underlying Kidney deficiency. Guānyuán REN-4 is also an important point in the treatment of post-partum disorders such as pain and persistent flow of lochia, which are also frequently due to a combination of deficiency and excess.

Finally, due to its powerful ability to restore the yang, Guānyuán REN-4 is used to treat collapse of yang characterised by chills, breathlessness, minute pulse, profuse sweating and unconsciousness. In such cases, Guānyuán REN-4, in combination with Qìhǎi REN-6 and Shénquè REN-8, is treated by continuous indirect moxibustion.
