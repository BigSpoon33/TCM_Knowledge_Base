## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Hòuxī SI-3 is both the shu-stream point of the Small Intestine channel, which is interiorly-exteriorly coupled with the Heart channel, and the confluent point of the Governing vessel. Most of its actions and indications can be explained by its relationship to these three channels. In clinical practice Hòuxī SI-3 can be seen to have four main spheres of action.

Firstly it is an important point to treat pain, stiffness and contraction along the course of its related channels. Taiyang (Small Intestine and Bladder) channel traverses the occiput, neck, scapula and paravertebral regions, whilst the Governing vessel ascends along the spinal column from the coccyx to the head. According to the Classic of Difficulties3 the shu-stream points are indicated for "heaviness of the body and pain of the joints". Hòuxī SI-3 is an essential distal point in the treatment of occipital headache (although also used for one-sided and bilateral headache) and stiffness and pain of the neck, whether acute or chronic and whether due to exterior pathogenic factors or interior disharmony. It has a significant influence on the spine as a whole, and is an important and frequently used distal point for pain of the upper spine and scapula, as well as in the treatment of acute lumbar sprain on the midline or lateral lumbar region. Hòuxī SI-3 is also important for disorders of the finger joints, especially the little and ring fingers, and may be needled deeply towards Sānjiān L.I.-3 when all four fingers are affected. Hòuxī SI-3 is equally important in the treatment of pain and contraction of the arm, elbow and shoulder.

The second principal action of Hòuxī SI-3 is to dispel febrile disease. This may be explained by the fact that the taiyang Small Intestine channel belongs to fire, taiyang is the most exterior of the six channels, and the Governing vessel governs all the yang channels and hence the exterior portion of the body as a whole. Hòuxī SI-3 is especially indicated in the treatment of malaria, and for when attack by exterior pathogenic wind-cold or wind-heat gives rise to chills and fever accompanied by severe neck pain or pain of the spine. A further reflection of its heat clearing action is in the treatment of night sweating, particularly in combination with Yīnxī HE-6.

In the Ode of the Obstructed River the use of Hòuxī SI-3 is referred to as one of 'the eight therapeutic methods'. In this description of the application of the eight confluent points of the extraordinary vessels to affect specific symptoms and areas of the body, Hòuxī SI-3 is indicated for diseases of the Governing vessel and for mania-depression. The third action of Hòuxī SI-3, therefore, is in calming the spirit and treating both mania-depression and epilepsy. The former is due to phlegm and phlegm-heat which disturb and agitate the spirit, and the latter to disturbance of the spirit and brain by pathogenic wind and phlegm. According to Sun Si-miao, the famous 7th century physician "the head is the supreme leader, the place where man's spirit concentrates"4, whilst in the 16th century, Li Shi-zhen stated "the brain is the residence of the original spirit". Since the Small Intestine channel is interiorly-exteriorly related to the Heart which stores the spirit, and Hòuxī SI-3 is the confluent point of the Governing vessel which enters the brain, this point has long been considered important in the treatment of epilepsy. The Song More Precious Than Jade, for example, recommends it for the five types of epilepsy.

Fourthly, in common with points Shàozé SI-1 and Qiángǔ SI-2, Hòuxī SI-3 is able to clear both exterior and interior heat from the Small Intestine channel in the head (especially the ears and eyes) and to benefit the sensory orifices. It is thus indicated for disorders such as tinnitus and deafness, superficial visual obstruction, redness, pain and swelling of the eyes with lacrimation, nosebleed, and pain and swelling of the cheeks.

Summary of clinical application
Important distal point for disorders of the neck, scapula, upper back, shoulder, arm and hand.
Used for acute lumbar sprain on the midline or lateral lumbar region.
Clears heat and reduces fever: malaria, night sweating, chills and fever, febrile disease with absence of sweating.
Treats epilepsy and mania-depression.
Treats the upper portion of the channel: deafness, tinnitus, redness, pain and swelling of the eyes and lacrimation, nosebleed, toothache, redness and swelling of the throat and cheek.
