## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The term 'Shang' in this point's name refers to the note associated with metal in the theory of five phase correspondences, and Shāngqiū SP-5 is the metal and jing-river point of the Spleen channel. According to five phase theory, therefore, it is the child point of the Spleen earth channel, suitable for reducing excess conditions. The Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man says "when the Spleen is excess, reduce Shāngqiū SP-5".

The Spleen, dominating the ceaseless yang functions of transportation and transformation, easily becomes deficient in qi and yang, and therefore most of its patterns of disharmony involve deficiency. There are two meanings, however, to the pattern of Spleen excess in relation to the actions of Shāngqiū SP-5. Firstly, if exterior pathogenic dampness or damp-heat attack the body, they may disrupt the function of the middle jiao giving rise to acute onset of symptoms such as chills and fever with vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, coughing and diarrhoea in children with loss of appetite, heaviness of the body and lethargy. Secondly, deficiency of Spleen qi and yang may lead to excess of yin in the form of accumulation of interior dampness, giving rise to chronic lethargy, indolence, somnolence, swelling of the face, diarrhoea and digestive difficulty. In both cases, there will be a thick and greasy tongue coating and a slippery pulse, indicating an excess pattern. Like many points of the Spleen channel, for example Tàibái SP-3, Shāngqiū SP-5 is able to address both the deficient and excess aspects of Spleen disharmony.

According to the Spiritual Pivot8 "When the disease is at the yin within yang (sinews and bones), needle the jing-river points of the yin channels". Shāngqiū SP-5, the jing-river point of the Spleen channel, is an important point in the treatment of disorders of the sinews, muscles and bones due to invasion and retention of pathogenic dampness. Damp painful obstruction, also known as fixed painful obstruction, is characterised by stiffness, swelling and heaviness of the joints and a tendency to worsen during humid weather. Since Spleen deficiency may predispose to or result from damp painful obstruction, points of the Spleen channel such as Shāngqiū SP-5 which both tonify the Spleen and resolve dampness are most often employed in the treatment of damp painful obstruction anywhere in the body, in combination with local points.Shāngqiū SP-5 is also mentioned in various classics for the treatment of bone painful obstruction, the development of painful obstruction where deformity of the joints occurs. Shāngqiū SP-5 is of course especially effective in treating disorders of the ankle joint and its surrounding soft tissue, whether due to painful obstruction or traumatic injury. In such disorders the needle may be directed to join with Jiěxī ST-41 at the anterior of the ankle joint.

According to the Spiritual Pivot9 "When the disease manifests itself in the voice, the jing-river point should be selected". Both the Spleen primary and divergent channels rise to the tongue and Shāngqiū SP-5 is indicated for stiffness and pain at the root of the tongue as well as for impaired speech.

The Spleen channel links with the Heart, and like several other points of the channel Shāngqiū SP-5 has many indications for disturbance of the spirit, for example mania-depression, agitation, melancholia, propensity to laughter, nightmares etc. This can be explained by the ability of Shāngqiū SP-5 both to tonify the Spleen and to clear dampness. If Spleen qi is deficient, the source of blood will be weak and the Heart and spirit will lack nourishment. Alternatively when dampness accumulates and transforms into phlegm it may be carried upwards to obstruct the Heart and cloud the spirit, whilst if phlegm transforms to phlegm-heat there will be agitation of the spirit. The Spiritual Pivot10 says "The Spleen stores the nutritive qi; nutritive qi is the residence of thought" whilst the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion says "Thought has its origins in the Spleen but takes shape in the Heart". Shāngqiū SP-5 is one of the few points indicated for excessive thinking, the mental activity which both results from Spleen disharmony and leads to injury of the Spleen.
