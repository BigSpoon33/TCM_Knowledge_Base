## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Qūchí L.I.-11 was included by Ma Dan-yang, the great physician of the Jin dynasty, among the 'eleven heavenly star points'11, his grouping of the most vital acupuncture points. It is a powerful and essential point in the treatment of fevers and heat in the body, skin diseases, hypertension and disorders of the arm.

Yangming or 'yang brightness' channel is considered to be particularly replete with yang qi, and points of the Large Intestine channel are among the most important points to clear excess of yang in the form of heat. Qūchí L.I.-11 is the principal point on the channel, and indeed one of the foremost points on the body, to clear heat and fire. It is used in all cases of fever due to excess heat when pathogenic factors have penetrated to the yangming or qi levels, and chills are no longer present. In this respect it may be compared to Hégǔ L.I.-4 which is mainly used when the pathogenic factors are still on the exterior in the form of wind-cold or wind-heat, when the fever is moderate, and when chills are still present. In clinical practice both points are commonly used together to control many different kinds of fever. Like Hégǔ L.I.-4 and other points of the Large Intestine channel, Qūchí L.I.-11 is also used to clear heat from the yangming channel in the head, whether it affects the throat, eyes or teeth, and it is indicated for swelling and pain of the throat, redness and pain of the eyes, lacrimation and toothache. Like Yángxī L.I.-5, it is able to clear yangming fire which transmits to the Heart and spirit, and it is indicated for agitation and oppression of the chest, mania disorder and tongue thrusting. For this reason, under its alternative name of Guitui (Ghost Leg) Qūchí L.I.-11 was included by Sun Si-miao among his 'thirteen ghost points' for the treatment of mania disorder and epilepsy.

According to the Spiritual Pivot12 "When the disease is at the yang within yang [skin], needle the he-sea points of the yang channels". Whilst this is not applicable in all cases, it is notable that Qūchí L.I.-11 and Wěizhōng BL-40, the he-sea points of the Large Intestine and Bladder channels respectively, are two of the most important points in the treatment of skin diseases. Qūchí L.I.-11 is classically indicated for a variety of skin disorders such as erysipelas (cinnabar toxin), urticaria, wind rash, shingles, clove sores and dry, scaly, and itchy skin. This reflects the ability of Qūchí L.I.-11 to expel wind, resolve damp, and clear heat, fire and fire-poison, the main components of excess-type skin disorders. In modern clinical practice, however, acupuncture is used as a primary therapy in relatively few dermatological diseases (pride of place being given to herbal medicine), and is considered to be of value principally in the treatment of urticaria, herpes zoster and itching of the skin.

According to the Classic of Difficulties13 he-sea points are effective in the treatment of "counterflow qi and diarrhoea" whilst the Spiritual Pivot says "in disorders of the Stomach and in disorders resulting from irregular eating and drinking, select the he-sea point"14. Although not having such a wide application in the treatment of these disorders as Shàngjùxū ST-37, the lower he-sea point of the Large Intestine, Qūchí L.I.-11 is indicated for vomiting and diarrhoea, as well as abdominal pain, and is an essential point in the treatment of dysenteric disorder, especially when accompanied by fever. In modern clinical practice it is much used for bacillary dysentery.

In recent times, Qūchí L.I.-11 has been widely used in the treatment of hypertension, often in combination with Zúsānlǐ ST-36. Hypertension as a category did not exist in traditional medicine, its clinical manifestations being included in the categories of headache, dizziness etc., and the effect of reducing these points to lower excessively high blood pressure is a modern interpretation of the statement in the Spiritual Pivot15 "Yangming channels are abundant in qi and blood".

Qūchí L.I.-11 is a major point in the treatment of disorders of the whole upper limb. According to Ma Dan-yang "Qūchí L.I.-11 is excellent for treating pain of the elbow, hemiplegia with inability to close the hand, inability to draw a bow, and flaccidity of the sinews so that a person cannot comb their hair". Qūchí L.I.-11 can both resolve obstruction in the channel resulting in pain and painful obstruction, and by regulating qi and blood can strengthen and nourish in all cases of weakness of the arm such as atrophy disorder. It is a vital point in the treatment of hemiplegia following windstroke, and for clonic spasm of the upper limb of any aetiology, and for this purpose is i. commonly combined with Jiānyú L.I.-15 and Hégǔ L.I.-4 in the 'chain and lock' point association method, and ii. joined by through-needling to Shàohǎi HE-3. This latter technique reflects the importance of Shàohǎi HE-3 as a point to treat disorders of the arm, as well as the clinical observation that while points from the yang channels are emphasised in the treatment of atrophy disorder and hemiplegia, better results are obtained when some points from yin channels are also included in the point prescription.

Finally it is worth noting that despite its status as the 'mother' point of the Large Intestine channel, the only tonifying application of Qūchí L.I.-11 is in nourishing the upper limb in this way, all its other actions being to reduce excess pathogenic factors of various kinds.
