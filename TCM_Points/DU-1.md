## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Ch√°ngqi√°ng DU-1 is the first point and the luo-connecting point of the Governing vessel, and all its indications reflect the pathways and functions of the Governing vessel principal and luo-connecting pathways.

The Governing vessel winds around the anus, and Ch√°ngqi√°ng DU-1 is an important local point in the treatment of haemorrhoids, prolapse of the rectum and disorders of defecation. The Governing vessel enters the Kidneys and its anterior pathway winds around the genitals. Ch√°ngqi√°ng DU-1 is therefore also indicated for various disorders of urination such as painful urinary dysfunction, difficult urination and retention of urine, as well as sexual taxation and the unusual symptom of seminal emission induced by fear and fright, emotions which are classically considered to injure the Kidneys and Heart.

The Governing vessel ascends along the entire length of the spinal column and enters the brain, whilst its luo-connecting channel spreads in the occiput. As well as lumbar and sacral pain and stiffness of the spine, Ch√°ngqi√°ng DU-1 is indicated for heaviness of the head. The Spiritual Pivot24 gives specific indications for disorders of the Governing luo-connecting channel. If it is excess there is stiffness of the spine, and if deficient there is heaviness of the head and shaking of the head.

Although the Heart is most frequently cited as the residence of the spirit, since its early beginnings Chinese medicine has been able to hold the concurrent belief that the head and brain also influence the spirit (see introductory discussion above). Thus the Essential Questions25 stated "the head is the residence of the intelligence" and Sun Si-miao, in the Thousand Ducat Formulas said "The head is the supreme leader, the place where man's spirit concentrates". Since the Governing vessel enters the brain and its anterior pathway ascends through the Heart, Ch√°ngqi√°ng DU-1 is indicated for such manifestations of disordered spirit as mania, mad walking and fright epilepsy, as well as for pain of the Heart.

According to qigong theory, there are three important gates or passes (sanguan) in the practice of qi circulation through the Governing vessel. These gates, through which it is more difficult to circulate the qi are the Coccyx Pass (Weiluguan) in the region of Ch√°ngqi√°ng DU-1, the Lumbar Pass (Jiajiguan) in the region of M√¨ngm√©n DU-4, and the Occipital Pass (Yuzhenwan) in the region of Y√πzhƒõn BL-9. Ch√°ngqi√°ng DU-1 has been accorded a great variety of different names. Its best known, Changqiang (Long Strong), is said to refer either to the Governing vessel (of which this is the first point) which is long and strong, or to this point's ability to make the penis long and strong. Alternative names include Longhuxue (Dragon and Tiger Point), Chaotiandian (Heavenward-Looking Summit) and Shangtianti (Stairway to Heaven).
