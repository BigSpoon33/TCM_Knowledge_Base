## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Géguān BL-46 (Diaphragm Gate) is level with Géshū BL-17 (Diaphragm Shu) the hui-meeting point of blood. Like Géshū BL-17, Géguān BL-46 has an important action on harmonising the diaphragm which lies between the upper and middle jiao and is able to resolve stagnation of qi in the upper jiao (fullness and oppression of the chest and diaphragm, sighing) and descend Stomach qi in the middle jiao (vomiting, difficult ingestion, belching).

Summary of clinical application
Regulates the Stomach, chest and diaphragm: belching, sighing, fullness and oppression of the chest and diaphragm, difficult ingestion, vomiting, vomiting blood.
Treats pain of the back and spine: stiffness and pain of the spine, difficulty in bending and extending the spine, back pain with aversion to cold, pain of the body, stiffness of the joints.
