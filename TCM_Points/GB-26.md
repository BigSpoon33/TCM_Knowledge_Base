## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

The Girdling vessel, encircling the waist like a belt, is the only major channel that runs horizontally. It passes through the points D√†im√†i GB-26, W«îsh≈´ GB-27 and W√©id√†o GB-28, and encircles and binds the Penetrating, Conception and Governing vessels and the Kidney, Liver and Spleen channels. The Girdling vessel plays an important role in controlling leucorrhoea and may be damaged by turbid dampness which sinks downwards, deficiency of Kidney yin or Kidney yang, invasion of exterior dampness which transforms into heat, or pouring down of Liver and Gall Bladder channel damp-heat, all of which may result in leucorrhoea. In fact, the term 'dai xia' (leucorrhoea) is made up of the characters 'dai', meaning belt or girdle, and 'xia', meaning downward. As the most important point to regulate the qi of the Girdling vessel, D√†im√†i GB-26 is indispensable in the treatment of leucorrhoea resulting from any of the above patterns.

According to the Spiritual Pivot7 "The Penetrating and Conception vessels both start in the uterus", whilst Confucians' Duties to Their Parents, the 13th century classic by Zhang Cong-zheng, states "The Penetrating, Conception and Governing vessels have the same starting point but different circulation, the same source but different branches, each of them connects with the Girdling vessel". The Conception vessel, Penetrating vessel and Governing vessel therefore all originate in the uterus in females and are all bound by the Girdling vessel. D√†im√†i GB-26 is not just an important point to activate the Girdling vessel itself, but has a significant influence on the Conception and Penetrating vessels, and is able to treat disorders of the uterus and menstruation such as infertility, irregular menstruation and amenorrhoea, and sinking of qi giving rise to uterine prolapse.

As well as regulating the qi of the Girdling vessel, D√†im√†i GB-26 is effective as a local point to resolve stagnation of qi deriving from disharmony of the Liver. Disorder of the Girdling vessel and qi stagnation in the lower jiao may lead to pain, distention and hardness of the lower abdomen in women, pain of the lateral costal region, shan disorder and lumbar pain.

Summary of clinical application
