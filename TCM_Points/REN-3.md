## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Zh≈çngj√≠ REN-3 is the front-mu point of the Bladder and a meeting point of the Conception vessel with the Spleen, Liver and Kidney channels. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body. Zh≈çngj√≠ REN-3 therefore has a direct action on the Bladder fu. Urinary disorders characterised by retention, pain, frequency and urgency of urination may be excess or deficient in nature. Excess patterns include accumulation of dampness or damp-heat and stagnation of qi, and may be complicated by the presence of stones or bleeding. Deficiency patterns primarily involve deficiency of qi and yang. Due to its ability to regulate the qi transformation function of the Bladder, drain dampness and heat, and strengthen the Kidneys, Zh≈çngj√≠ REN-3 is a primary point in the treatment of a variety of urinary disorders involving any of these disharmonies. In clinical practice however, Zh≈çngj√≠ REN-3 is favoured for excess patterns, whilst GuƒÅnyu√°n REN-4 is favoured for deficiency patterns. By virtue of its ability to promote smooth urination, Zh≈çngj√≠ REN-3 is also indicated for oedema.

The ability of Zh≈çngj√≠ REN-3 to drain dampness and heat extends to the genital region where it is an important point for itching, swelling and pain as well as leucorrhoea and seminal emission. The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion specifically recommends Zh≈çngj√≠ REN-3 for pain and swelling of the cervix.

The Spleen controls blood, the Liver stores blood, and the Kidneys and the Conception vessel dominate the uterus and conception. Zh≈çngj√≠ REN-3, as a meeting point of all these channels, is able to regulate the uterus and menstruation and is primarily indicated for excess patterns giving rise to abdominal (zheng jia) masses, irregular or absent menstruation, infertility, and especially retention of the placenta or lochia.

The three leg yin channels of Spleen, Liver and Kidney all pass through and dominate the lower abdomen. As a meeting point of the Conception vessel with these three channels, Zh≈çngj√≠ REN-3 therefore has a strong action on the lower abdomen as a whole, predominantly in excess patterns involving stagnation and accumulation of cold or heat. It is indicated for masses, shan disorder and severe twisting pain, and both hot and cold sensations in the abdomen.

Zh≈çngj√≠ REN-3 is also used for the condition known as running piglet qi, particularly when due to Kidney yang deficiency with invasion of cold. According to the Essentials From the Golden Cabinet "Running piglet disorder arises from the lower abdomen; it rushes up to the throat with such ferocity that the patient feels he is close to death. It attacks and then remits. It is brought about by fear and fright".

Finally, Zh≈çngj√≠ REN-3 is indicated for deficiency of yang qi and lower origin (yuan) deficiency. However, so great are the tonifying properties of GuƒÅnyu√°n REN-4 that in clinical practice this latter point is almost invariably used for this purpose. Like GuƒÅnyu√°n REN-4 also, Zh≈çngj√≠ REN-3 is indicated for lumbar pain, reflecting the principle of selecting points from the front of the body to treat the back.
