## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Tiānchuāng SI-16 is one of ten points listed in Chapter 2 of the Spiritual Pivot that have come to be known as Window of Heaven points. As a group, these ten points have the action of regulating rebellious and chaotic (inversion) qi. Tiānchuāng SI-16 illustrates many of the characteristic actions of these points in its ability to i. treat goitre and throat disorders, ii. treat headache and heat and swelling of the face and cheek, iii. treat disorders of the sense organs - in this case the ears, iv. treat sudden onset of disorders - in this case loss of voice. In addition, like two other points from this group (Tiānzhù BL-10 and Tiānfǔ LU-3) Tiānchuāng SI-16 treats disorders characterised in the classical texts as seeing or communicating with ghosts and therefore attributed to some form of demonic possession. In terms of modern medicine these indications refer to various forms of severe mental disorder including schizophrenia. For a fuller discussion see the Window of Heaven points.

Sun Si-miao, the famous 7th century physician, particularly emphasised the use of moxibustion (fifty cones) at this point for loss of speech and hemiplegia.

Summary of clinical application
Window of Heaven point: treats i. goitre and throat disorders (hoarseness, throat pain) ii. headache and heat and swelling of the face and cheek, iii. disorders of the sense organs - in this case the ears (deafness, tinnitus, ear pain), iv. sudden onset of disorders (sudden loss of voice).
Treats mania-depression and ‘manic ghost talk’.
