## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Yīxǐ BL-45 is level with Dūshū BL-16 which is listed in some classical texts as the back-shu point of the Governing vessel. Whilst Dūshū BL-16 has few indications which reflect disorder of the Governing vessel, some of the indications of Yīxǐ BL-45, for example visual dizziness, eye pain, nosebleed, malaria, headache and chest pain radiating to the lumbar region, may be understood in this way.

Summary of clinical application
Rarely used.
Lies level with Dūshū BL-16 (listed in some classics as the backshu point of the Governing vessel) and has some Governing vessel indications: visual dizziness, eye pain, nosebleed, malaria, headache and chest pain radiating to the lumbar region.
