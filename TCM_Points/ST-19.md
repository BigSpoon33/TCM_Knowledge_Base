Because of its location, B√πr√≥ng ST-19 is sometimes selected for the treatment of hypochondriac pain, nausea and vomiting due to cholecystitis or cholelithiasis. Its name 'Not Contained' or 'Uncontainable' refers to the inability of the Stomach to retain its contents.

Summary of clinical application
Used for hypochondriac pain, nausea and vomiting, especially when due to cholecystitis or cholelithiasis.
Also indicated for cough, dyspnoea, difficult breathing with raised shoulders, pain of the chest, back, shoulder and intercostal region and pain of the Heart.
