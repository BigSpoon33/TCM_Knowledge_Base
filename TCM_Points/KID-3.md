## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

The Kidneys occupy a unique position among the zangfu, both storing the yin essence and conserving and controlling the ming men fire. The Kidneys are thus the root of the yin and yang of the whole body. Because of this fundamental role, deficiency of the Kidneys may both cause and result from disharmony of any of the other zangfu.

The Spiritual Pivot in Chapter 6 recommends the use of the shu-stream points in the treatment of disorders of the zang, whilst in Chapter 1 it says "When the five zang are diseased, select [from] the twelve yuan-source [points]". T√†ixƒ´ KID-3, the shu-stream and yuan-source point, is therefore the principal point on the Kidney channel to treat disharmony of the Kidney zang, which due to the unique nature of the Kidneys always involves deficiency, principally of Kidney yin or Kidney yang.

Kidney yin deficiency may affect the Kidneys alone, or by failing to nourish the Liver, Heart or Lung, all of which are reached by the Kidney channel, affect these zang also. Yin deficiency may manifest in two main ways: failure to nourish and moisten, or failure to restrain fire. The art of treating yin deficiency lies in carefully assessing the relative importance of these two aspects, and placing appropriate emphasis on nourishing yin and cooling fire.

T√†ixƒ´ KID-3 is the foremost point to treat yin deficiency affecting those areas of the body either reached by the Kidney channel or dominated by the Kidneys, specifically the throat, intestines, brain, teeth and ears. The Kidney primary channel ascends to the throat, and if heat from deficiency scorches and dries this region there may be chronic low-grade sore throat which is typically worse with tiredness, at the end of the day and at night. The Kidneys dominate the two lower yin (anus and urethra), and if deficient fluids and deficiency heat dessicate the intestines, there will be difficult defecation, illustrated by Wu Ju-tong's graphic image in the Systematic Differentiation of Warm Diseases "When the fluids are deficient there is not enough water to make the boat move". The Spiritual Pivot7 states "The brain is the sea of marrow". Kidney essence produces marrow to fill the brain and spinal cord, and in cases where the sea of marrow is deficient there will be headache and dizziness. According to a saying of Chinese medicine "The teeth are the surplus of the bones". If the Kidneys fail to nourish the teeth, and heat from deficiency rises to this area, there will be chronic toothache accompanied by looseness of the teeth. The Spiritual Pivot8 says "Kidney qi opens into the ears, when the Kidney is in harmony the ears can hear the five sounds". Deficiency of the Kidneys, therefore, can result in tinnitus and deafness. In all these cases, T√†ixƒ´ KID-3 is the primary point to tonify and nourish the Kidneys.

The intimate relationship between the Kidney yin and Liver yin, and the Kidney essence and Liver blood, is emphasised in the saying "the Kidneys and the Liver share the same origin", and the statement in Comprehensive Medicine According to Master Zhang "[When] the essence is not discharged it will return to the Liver and transform into clear blood". T√†ixƒ´ KID-3 is commonly used in prescriptions to treat Kidney-Liver disharmony (whether due to failure of water to nourish wood, or to injury to the Kidneys from prolonged Liver disease) giving rise to such symptoms as headache, dizziness, tinnitus and deafness.

The Kidneys pertain to water and the Heart to fire, and both belong to shaoyin. The Heart stores the spirit and the Kidneys store the will. When the Kidneys and the Heart function harmoniously, Heart fire and Kidney water, the spirit and the will, mutually support each other. When the Heart and Kidneys lose harmony, Heart yang is unable to descend to warm the Kidneys, and Kidney yin is unable to nourish Heart yin and restrain Heart fire. This loss of contact between water and fire disturbs the spirit and gives rise to insomnia, excessive dreaming and poor memory, usually of the severe and chronic kind. T√†ixƒ´ KID-3 is an important point to bolster the Kidneys and enable them to support the Heart.

The Lung is the 'canopy' and the Kidneys are the root. The Lung descends qi and fluids to the Kidneys below, the Kidneys anchor the qi and steam the fluids to moisten the Lung above. Kidney-Lung disharmony commonly manifests in two main ways, i. Kidney yin deficiency fails to moisten and cool the Lung giving rise to symptoms such as wheezing, dry cough and blood-streaked sputum, and ii. the Kidneys fail to receive and anchor the qi from the Lung giving rise to such symptoms as dyspnoea, coughing and asthma. T√†ixƒ´ KID-3 is indicated in both these patterns of "excess above and deficiency below" and was specifically recommended by Sun Si-miao in the Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas for Kidney cough.

Although subdivided into Kidney yin and Kidney yang, the Kidneys are of course one zang. Even though in clinical practice deficiency of either yin or yang will usually predominate, when one aspect of the Kidneys is deficient, it is frequently the case that the other will also become deficient. This is clearly spelt out both by the Essential Questions9 which states "Injury to yin will reach the yang, injury to yang will reach the yin", and by the Essential Readings in Medicine which says "Without yang, yin cannot engender; without yin, yang cannot transform". It is a long-standing principle of tonifying the Kidneys that in Kidney yang deficiency one should also nourish Kidney yin, and that in nourishing Kidney yin one should also pay attention to the Kidney yang. Thus the Essential Questions10 says "[For] yang diseases treat the yin, [for] yin diseases treat the yang", and Zhang Jing-yue echoes this in his statement "Nourishing yin to help yang is a skilful way to strengthen yang". For this reason, almost all acupuncture points that tonify the Kidneys will benefit both Kidney yin and Kidney yang. T√†ixƒ´ KID-3, the principal point on the Kidney channel to tonify the Kidneys, exemplifies this principle.

When Kidney yang fails to warm the body and transform fluids, there may be coldness of the lower limbs, backache, and urinary symptoms such as frequent and copious urination and incontinence. The close relationship between the Kidneys and the libido and sexual function is underscored by the application of T√†ixƒ´ KID-3 in the treatment of impotence, seminal emission and sexual taxation (depletion and exhaustion due to excessive sexual activity).

According to the Essential Questions11 "The Kidneys dominate hibernation and are the root of sealed storage and the residence of essence; their radiance manifests in the hair and fills the bones". The Kidney primary, luo-connecting and sinew channels all ascend through the spine, and any pattern of Kidney deficiency may lead to malnourishment of the sinews, muscles and bones, especially in the lumbar region, the 'residence' of the Kidneys. T√†ixƒ´ KID-3 has long been used for the treatment of Kidney deficiency lumbar pain, and is also indicated for heel pain, which may be due to Kidney deficiency, traumatic injury or painful obstruction. In the treatment of heel pain, T√†ixƒ´ KID-3 should be needled to obtain sensation radiating strongly to the heel region.

The Penetrating and Conception vessels are both nourished by and have their root in the Kidneys, and the Essential Questions says "the vessel of the uterus connects with the Kidneys"12. T√†ixƒ´ KID-3 may be used when Kidney deficiency leads to disharmony of these extraordinary vessels resulting in irregular menstruation, although it is interesting to note that this is a modern indication and that no gynaecological indications or combinations appear in any major classical texts.

Finally T√†ixƒ´ KID-3 is cited in the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc.
