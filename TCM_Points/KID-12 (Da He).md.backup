## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The action of Dàhè KID-12 in astringing essence is reflected in its application for both seminal emission and leucorrhoea.

Seminal emission (involuntary loss of sperm) may be due to various aetiologies. Ejaculatory function is an aspect of the free and smooth flow of Liver qi, whilst the Kidneys dominate the 'gate of essence'. If there is undue heat (e.g. Liver fire, Heart fire, heat from Kidney yin deficiency) this will force the seminal fluid to burst out recklessly. Alternatively, deficiency of the Kidney astringing function will lead to infirmity of the gate of essence resulting in leakage of seminal fluid. According to Zhu Dan-xi, seminal emission with erotic dreams "is exclusively governed by heat"25, whilst it is said traditionally that if due to cold and deficiency there will be no such dreaming. Whatever the aetiology, Dàhè KID-12 (like a number of other Kidney channel points on the lower abdomen) is an important point in the treatment of seminal emission.

As far as leucorrhoea is concerned, it should be noted that although primarily due to damp, damp-heat or toxic heat, leucorrhoea may also be due to deficiency of Kidney qi or yang, and that this kind of leucorrhoea entails loss of essence and is the female equivalent of loss of seminal fluid.

Summary of clinical application
Firms the gate of essence and astringes seminal emission.
Treats leucorrhoea, especially when due to deficiency of Kidney qi or yang and when involving leakage of essence.
