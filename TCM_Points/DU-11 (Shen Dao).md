## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Shéndào DU-11 (Spirit Pathway) is located on the upper back in the region of the Lung, at the level of Xīnshū BL-15 the back-shu point of the Heart. The Lung dominates qi and the Heart stores the spirit, and together they are activated by the gathering qi. Shéndào DU-11 is indicated for deficiency of the gathering qi and malnourishment of the Heart and spirit giving rise to such indications as lack of qi, timidity with shortness of breath, palpitations, disorientation, poor memory and sadness and anxiety.

In common with many points of this channel, Shéndào DU-11 is also able to pacify internally generated wind which ascends along the Governing vessel and gives rise to such disorders as epilepsy, clonic spasm, childhood fright wind and lockjaw.

Finally Shéndào DU-11 is indicated for a variety of heat symptoms including fever, heat in the body, hot dyspnoea and, according to the Essential Questions32, heat in the Liver. This last indication clearly fell out of favour and was not mentioned in subsequent texts.

Summary of clinical application
Tonifies the gathering (zong) qi: lack of qi, timidity with shortness of breath, palpitations, disorientation, poor memory, sadness and anxiety.
Treats interior wind: epilepsy, clonic spasm, lockjaw, childhood fright wind (a disorder of infants and children characterised by convulsive spasm of the limbs and loss of consciousness; it is generally subdivided into acute and chronic fright wind).
