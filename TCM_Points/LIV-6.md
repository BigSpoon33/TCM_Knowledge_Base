## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Zh≈çngd≈´ LIV-6 is the xi-cleft point of the Liver channel. The xi-cleft points are where the qi and blood, which flow relatively superficially along the channels from the jing-well points, gather and plunge more deeply. The xi-cleft points in general are indicated in the treatment of acute conditions and pain, whilst the xi-cleft points of the yin channels have an additional action of treating disorders of blood. Despite the status of Zh≈çngd≈´ LIV-6 as a xi-cleft point, however, other than treating persistent flow of lochia and uterine bleeding it has relatively few indications of this kind.

The Classic of the Jade Dragon recommends Zh≈çngd≈´ LIV-6 for numbness of the body and numbness of the hands and feet, the Investigation into Points Along the Channels for flaccidity and emaciation of the legs, and the Thousand Ducat Formulas for heat in the soles, which together reflect a clinical picture of atrophy disorder due to damp-heat. In modern clinical practice, however, Zh≈çngd≈´ LIV-6 is rarely used, and from the paucity of classical combinations for this point it seems that this has always been the case.

Summary of clinical application
Xi-cleft point of the Liver channel, although there are few matching indications apart from persistent flow of lochia and uterine bleeding.
Indicated for numbness of the body, numbness of the hands and feet, flaccidity and emaciation of the legs, and heat in the soles reflecting a clinical picture of atrophy disorder due to damp-heat.
Also indicated for shan disorder, lower abdominal pain, hypogastric pain, diarrhoea, persistent flow of lochia, uterine bleeding, damp painful obstruction with inability to walk, cold sensation of the lower legs with inability to stand for long.
