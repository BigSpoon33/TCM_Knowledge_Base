## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Shenting DU-24 (Courtyard of the Spirit) is also known as Tianting (Courtyard of Heaven). Like several of the points of the Governing vessel, it has a strong action on calming the spirit and treating epilepsy and mania disorder. It is dramatically and graphically indicated for the treatment of those who undress, climb to high places, sing and mimic other people‚Äôs speech. The action of the Governing vessel points on the spirit can be explained in three ways. Firstly, of all the channels, the Governing vessel has the closest relationship with the brain. As explained in the introductory discussion to the Governing vessel (see above) the head and brain were considered among pre-Inner Classic and later Daoist traditions to be the seat of the spirit, and one cause of mental disorders was traditionally perceived to be wind entering the brain through the Governing vessel. Secondly, the Governing vessel anterior pathway enters the Heart, and thus strongly links the brain and Heart which is more commonly understood to be the residence of the spirit. Thirdly, mania disorder is characterised by heat, and points of the Governing vessel, the ‚Äòsea of the yang channels‚Äô, are important to clear pathogenic heat from the whole body. As far as Shenting DU-24 in particular is concerned, it is said to directly access Niwan (Mud Ball), also known as Huangting (The Yellow Courtyard). The Niwan in the Daoist tradition is the central one of the nine palaces of the brain and is considered to be the location of the material basis of the spirit. The Classic on the Central Void in the Inner Sphere said ‚ÄúThe origin of essence-spirit in the brain is also called Niwan‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe entire spirit that expresses in the face has its origin in Niwan‚Äù,48 whilst the Daoist Classic Collected Wisdom by Master Magic Sword stated ‚ÄúThe qi of the Heart is connected with the Niwan Palace above‚Äù.49

The second principal action of Shenting DU-24 is to pacify pathologically ascending interior wind (upward staring eyes, dizziness and epilepsy), and to dispel exterior pathogenic wind (head wind, headache with chills and fever and cold sensation of the head). Since Shenting DU-24 is a meeting point of the Governing vessel with the Stomach channel, it is specifically indicated for wind dizziness accompanied by vomiting, and vomiting with agitation and fullness.

Finally, like Shangxing DU-23, Shenting DU-24 is indicated for a variety of nasal and eye disorders including clear and ceaseless nasal discharge, nasal congestion and discharge, nosebleed, lacrimation and lack of visual clarity. It is interesting to note, however, that a number of classics including the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and the Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man warn that this point is contraindicated for needling as it may give rise to adverse effects such as damage to the eyesight or mania.
