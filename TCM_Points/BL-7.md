## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The Essential Questions1 says "Heavenly qi connects with the Lung" whilst the Spiritual Pivot2 says "Lung qi connects with the nose". In other words, the heavenly qi of air enters the Lung through its gateway the nose, which plays a part in absorbing the qi. For this reason, in qigong breathing practice, inhaling through the nose is always emphasised, whilst exhaling may be through the nose or mouth. The name Tongtian (Heavenly Connection) refers to the ability of this point to keep the nose free and unobstructed and thus assist in circulating the heavenly qi through the nose and Lung.

Tōngtiān BL-7 is one of the foremost points on the head to treat all disorders of the nose (including rhinitus, loss of sense of smell, nosebleed and nasal sores), and in such cases is often found to be tender on palpation. According to the Methods of Acupuncture and Moxibustion from the Golden Mirror of Medicine by Wu Qian, this point should be combined with Shàngxīng DU-23 for nasal congestion and discharge and nasal polyps. This text also specifies that moxa should be applied to right Tōngtiān BL-7 for the left nostril and to left Tōngtiān BL-7 for the right nostril.

Tōngtiān BL-7 is also indicated for phlegm obstructing the upper portion of the body and manifesting as profuse nasal discharge, heaviness of the head, swollen face, goitre and dyspnoea.

Finally, Tōngtiān BL-7 is an important local point in the treatment of vertex headache due to any aetiology.
