## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Tiānliáo SJ-15 and Jiānjǐng GB-21 are neighbouring points with a similar effect in the treatment of stiffness, pain and spasm in the area between the shoulder joint and the neck. In such situations they should both be palpated, and the more tender should be needled. Like Jiānjǐng GB-21, the action of Tiānliáo SJ-15 also extends downwards into the chest, where it is indicated for agitation, oppression, heat and fullness.

Summary of clinical application
Treats stiffness, pain and spasm in the area between the shoulder joint and the neck as well as agitation, oppression, heat and fullness of the chest.
