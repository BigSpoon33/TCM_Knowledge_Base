## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

R«îgƒìn ST-18 is the principle local point for treating disorders of the breast. According to Zhu Dan-xi of the Jin-Yuan dynasty "The breasts are where the yangming passes, and the nipples are ascribed to the jueyin"9. Disharmony of the Stomach yangming or Liver jueyin channels is therefore involved in all breast disorders. Since R«îgƒìn ST-18 regulates the qi and blood of the breast area as a whole, it may be used for any excess type breast disorder characterised by pain, distention, swelling or abscess, whether due to Stomach fire or oppression and stagnation of Liver qi (the two main excess interior pathological factors in breast disease).

Nursing mothers are particularly prone to breast disorders. Zhu Dan-xi went on to say "If the breast-feeding mother has thick flavoured [food] or bears indignation or grudges, qi will therefore stop circulating and the portals will become blocked. [Because] milk is no longer able to come out, the blood of the yangming becomes hot and transforms into pus"10. As well as breast abscess due to these internal factors, R«îgƒìn ST-18 is also indicated when exposure of the breast to exterior pathogenic factors, improper suckling, or even, according to Zhu Dan-xi, the burning hot breath of the new-born baby blowing onto the breast, lead to heat, stagnation and swelling. As far as scanty lactation is concerned, this is most commonly due to stagnation of Liver qi resulting in failure of free flow, or to insufficiency of qi and blood, mainly due to deficiency of the Stomach and Spleen. R«îgƒìn ST-18 is indicated whatever the pattern.

According to the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion R«îgƒìn ST-18 is recommended for "pain of the chest, diaphragm qi". This refers to oppression of the chest with shortness of breath due to stagnation of Liver qi. R«îgƒìn ST-18 may also be used more widely for cough or asthma.

Finally, according to the Ode of Xi-hong, R«îgƒìn ST-18 may be used to promote and hasten labour, although it is not traditionally contraindicated in pregnancy.

Summary of clinical application
The principle local point for treating disorders of the breast (abscess, pain, disorders of lactation).
Local point for stagnation of qi in the chest and diaphragm (cough, dyspnoea, oppression and pain).
