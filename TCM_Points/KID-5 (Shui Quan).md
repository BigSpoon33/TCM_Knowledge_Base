## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Shuǐquán KID-5 is the xi-cleft point of the Kidney channel. The xi-cleft points are where the qi and blood, which flow relatively superficially along the channels from the jing-well points, gather and plunge more deeply. The xi-cleft points in general are indicated in the treatment of acute conditions and pain, whilst the xi-cleft points of the yin channels have an additional action of treating disorders of blood.

There is an intimate relationship between the Kidneys, the uterus, blood and menstruation. The Essential Questions says "The vessel of the uterus connects with the Kidneys"13 and "At the age of fourteen, the tian gui14 matures, the Conception vessel flows and the Penetrating vessel fills, the menses come according to their times, thus conception is possible"15. Normal development of the uterus and the Conception and Penetrating vessels depend on healthy functioning of the Kidneys and maturation of the Kidney essence. At the same time, harmonious menstruation depends on adequate formation of blood in the body, especially the Liver blood which flows to the Conception and Penetrating vessels to form menstrual blood. The close relationship between the Kidneys and Liver blood was emphasised in Comprehensive Medicine According to Master Zhang which said "[When] the essence is not discharged it will return to the Liver and transform into clear blood", whilst the Kidneys themselves play an important role in the formation of blood, stated unequivocally in Disease Mechanisms According to Master Sha "The source of blood is the Kidneys".

If the Kidneys are deficient, then the function of the Conception and Penetrating vessels will be disturbed and the formation of blood impaired. Shuǐquán KID-5, the xi-cleft point of the Kidney channel, and thus able to treat disorders of blood, regulates the qi and blood in the Kidney, Conception and Penetrating vessels. It is indicated for a variety of menstrual disorders such as amenorrhoea, irregular menstruation, dysmenorrhoea and delayed menstruation (with oppression and pain below the Heart on onset of menstruation), whether characterised by deficiency (of blood or qi) or excess (stasis of blood).
