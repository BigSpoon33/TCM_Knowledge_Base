## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Jùgǔ L.I.-16 is frequently used as an adjacent point in the treatment of shoulder disorders, and in such cases should always be palpated for tenderness. The use of Jùgǔ L.I.-16 is particularly emphasised when the shoulder disorder is chronic and recalcitrant, reflected by the indication for blood stasis in the shoulder. This is explained by the saying "Chronic disease is frequently [due to] stasis". Its action on treating disorders of blood also extends to blood stasis in the chest and vomiting blood.

Like Shǒuwǔlǐ L.I.-13, Bìnào L.I.-14 and Jiānyú L.I.-15, Jùgǔ L.I.-16 is indicated for scrofula.

Summary of clinical application
Local point for shoulder disorders, especially when chronic and when there is blood stasis.
Also for blood stasis in the chest and vomiting blood.
