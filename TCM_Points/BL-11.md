## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

D√†zh√π BL-11 is the hui-meeting point of bones and is indicated for various bone diseases and rigidity and pain of the neck, spine and lumbar region. In modern clinical practice it is used when painful obstruction due to pathogenic wind, cold, damp or heat penetrates deeply into the bones and joints causing deformity (known as bony painful obstruction). D√†zh√π BL-11 is also indicated for contraction of the sinews, and the Spiritual Pivot4 especially recommends D√†zh√π BL-11 for treating contraction of the sinews that may accompany madness.

The Ming dynasty classic Investigation into Points Along the Channels says that D√†zh√π BL-11 is indicated "for injury by wind which does not disperse, with bursting headache, soreness and pain of the back and scapula, interstices that are not closed, susceptibility to catching wind-cold". Taiyang channel is the most exterior of the six channels, and therefore most commonly the first to be injured by exterior pathogenic wind-cold. It is for this reason that exterior wind-cold pattern often gives rise to headache and pain of the neck which may extend down the upper back (taiyang channel). At the same time, exterior pathogenic wind-cold which first attacks the surface portion of the body easily penetrates to the Lung, since the Lung controls the skin and body hair. D√†zh√π BL-11 is a point of taiyang channel and a meeting point of the taiyang Bladder channel with the taiyang Small Intestine channel. Furthermore it is located on the upper back, close to both the neck and the Lung. It therefore has a strong action both on the exterior portion of the body (demonstrated by its ability to expel wind-cold manifesting as stiffness and pain of the neck and scapula, fever, cold shivering and absence of sweating), as well as on the Lung (demonstrated by its ability to relieve coughing, dyspnoea and fullness of the chest). In this respect it is very similar to Fƒìngm√©n BL-12, especially in its ability both to expel excess pathogenic wind-cold and to firm the exterior in cases of deficiency (e.g. interstices and pores that do not close, susceptibility to catching wind-cold).

According to the Spiritual Pivot5 D√†zh√π BL-11 is a point of the 'sea of blood'. This passage says "The Penetrating vessel is the sea of the twelve channels [i.e. the sea of blood]. In the upper it is conveyed to D√†zh√π BL-11, and in the lower it emerges at both Sh√†ngj√πx≈´ ST-37 and Xi√†j√πx≈´ ST-39 ... When the sea of blood is in excess, there is a sensation as if the body were big; one feels disquiet, but does not know what disease there is; when the sea of blood is insufficient, one has the sensation of one's body being small; one feels reduced but does not know what could be the illness". Despite this passage it is worth noting that such indications are not found in later texts. Some commentators however interpret various indications of D√†zh√π BL-11 as relating to disorder of the Penetrating vessel, especially the signs of qi rebellion in the chest (cough, fullness of the chest, dyspnoea) and head (dizziness). Finally, the Essential Questions6 includes D√†zh√π BL-11 among the eight points (bilateral Quƒìp√©n ST-12, D√†zh√π BL-11, Zh≈çngf«î LU-1 and Fƒìngm√©n BL-12) to clear heat from the chest.

Summary of clinical application
Releases the exterior: fever, cold shivering, injury by cold without sweating, malaria, headache, throat painful obstruction.
For Lung and chest disorders: cough, fullness of the chest, dyspnoea, heat in the chest.
Hui-meeting point of bones: bone diseases, rigidity of the spine and neck, lumbar and scapular pain, spasm, contraction of the sinews associated with madness, stiffness and pain of the knee.
