## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Jiache ST-6 (Jaw Bone) is an important point in the treatment of a wide range of local disorders affecting the jaw, including inability to chew, inability to open the mouth after windstroke, lockjaw, and tension, pain or paralysis of the jaw. Its range of action extends upwards along the Stomach channel into the face for deviation of the mouth and eye and swelling of the cheek, and downwards along the channel for mumps, and stiffness and pain of the neck. The predominant pathogenic factor in all these different disorders is wind, whether of external or internal origin. Jiache ST-6 is also a major point in the treatment of disorders of the gum and teeth of the lower jaw.

Jiache ST-6 is one of the ‘thirteen ghost points’, listed under its alternative name Guichuang (Ghost’s Bed) in the Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas by Sun Simiao. This grouping of points was used to treat mania and epilepsy, and it is unclear why Jiache ST-6 was ascribed this action, especially in the light of the fact that there are no indications of this kind listed for the point. One possible explanation is the fear that epileptics might bite off their tongue while gnashing their teeth during a fit, in which case Jiache ST-6 would be included in a prescription for epilepsy in order to relax the jaw.

Summary of clinical application
Important local point for disorders of the jaw (pain, paralysis, tension, spasm), the teeth and gums, the face (facial paralysis, swelling of the cheek, inability to chew, inability to open the mouth following windstroke) and the neck (stiffness and pain, mumps).
Frequently joined to points such as Dìcāng ST-4, Dàyíng ST-5, Xiàguān ST-7 etc. for facial paralysis and facial pain.
