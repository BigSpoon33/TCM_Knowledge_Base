## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

As early as the Essential Questions33 Shēnzhù DU-12 was said to clear heat from the chest, and this is reinforced by many indications found in subsequent classical texts. Shēnzhù DU-12, located below the third thoracic vertebra at the level of Fèishū BL-13 the back-shu point of the Lung, is able to clear heat from the Lung, giving rise to cough, dyspnoea and fever. According to the Warp and Woof of Warm Febrile Diseases "The Lung and Heart are mutually connected; when there is Lung heat it most easily enters the Heart". This passage helps explain why Shēnzhù DU-12 is also indicated for heat in the Heart which gives rise to such excess pattern manifestations of spirit disturbance as mad walking, ranting and raving, 'seeing ghosts' and rage with desire to kill. This ability to clear heat from the Lung and calm the spirit in excess patterns can be contrasted to the action of the previous point, Shéndào DU-11, which is primarily used for deficiency patterns of the Heart and Lung.

Like many other points of this channel, Shēnzhù DU-12 is also able to pacify wind in the Governing vessel and is indicated for epilepsy and clonic spasm.

Summary of clinical application
For heat in the Lung: cough, dyspnoea, fever.
For heat which disturbs the Heart and spirit: mad walking, ranting and raving, seeing ghosts, rage with desire to kill.
