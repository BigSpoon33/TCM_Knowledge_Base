## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The region of Jiānjǐng GB-21, at the crest of the trapezius muscle, is particularly prone to symptoms of contraction, tightness and pain due to a variety of aetiologies. The Gall Bladder is interiorly-exteriorly coupled with the Liver. Stagnation of Liver qi or uprising of Liver yang due to anger, frustration, resentment etc. commonly vent upwards along the Gall Bladder channel, and readily accumulate in and below the neck, especially when tightness and restriction in the relatively narrow neck region prevent their upward flow. The close relationship between the upper body and anger was emphasised in many texts, for example the Essential Questions4 which stated "anger will cause the qi to surge upwards". Alternatively, the region of Jiānjǐng GB-21 may be injured by sprain, penetration by wind-cold (especially after sleeping in a cold draught), prolonged poor posture or occupational strain. Jiānjǐng GB-21 may be needled in all such cases of stiffness of the neck and shoulders, which may extend to the back or arm.

Jiānjǐng GB-21 is indicated for a variety of phlegm disorders. Phlegm may involve Liver or Gall Bladder pathology in the following three ways: i. Liver qi stagnation leads to stagnation of fluids which condense into phlegm, summed up in the statement in the Treatise on Disorders of Blood "When qi flows, water also flows", ii. Liver wind ascends carrying phlegm with it (this is one of the main pathological features of windstroke), and iii. Liver or Gall Bladder fire steams and condenses fluids into phlegm. By virtue of its actions of regulating qi, lowering and transforming phlegm and dissipating nodules, Jiānjǐng GB-21 is used in the treatment of such phlegm disorders as hemiplegia, loss of speech following windstroke, windstroke, scrofula and goitre.

Jiānjǐng GB-21 also has a strong qi descending action and is indicated in various disorders of rebellious qi such as cough and dyspnoea, rebellion of qi, and leg qi ascending to attack the Heart. Leg qi is a disorder characterised by numbness, pain, weakness, spasm, swelling, redness and heat sensations of the feet and legs. In severe cases the pathogen attacks more deeply affecting the abdomen and Heart.

Difficult labour may be due to stagnation or deficiency of qi and blood. In either case, due to its strong descending action, Jiānjǐng GB-21 has long been used to expedite delivery and promote the descent of the placenta, and for this reason is contraindicated in pregnancy. Jiānjǐng GB-21 is also specifically indicated by the Classic of Supplementing Life with Acupuncture and Moxibustion for "Inversion counterflow coldness of the arms and legs following miscarriage". A similar condition in post-partum women is described by the famous Qing dynasty gynaecologist Fu Qing-zhu who says "In the course of delivery, some women overexert themselves with taxation and fatigue injuring the Spleen. As a result, there occurs inversion with counterflow chilling of the limbs, qi ascends to fill up the chest, the pulse departs, and form deserts"5. The implied ability of Jiānjǐng GB-21 to tonify deficiency following miscarriage, is surprisingly mirrored in its indications for a variety of deficiency patterns including wind-taxation, the five taxations and seven injuries, Kidney deficiency lumbar pain and steaming bone disorder.

So strong is the action of Jiānjǐng GB-21 in descending qi that Gao Wu, in the Ode of Xi-hong, says "When you needle Jiānjǐng GB-21 you must needle Zúsānlǐ ST-36. If this is not done, the qi will not be regulated". In other words, the action of Zúsānlǐ ST-36 on tonifying and raising the qi will help to counter any excessive descent of the qi resulting from needling Jiānjǐng GB-21.

Jiānjǐng GB-21 is also indicated for breast disorders. The Gall Bladder primary channel penetrates the chest and the Gall Bladder sinew channel connects with the breast, whilst Jiānjǐng GB-21 is a meeting point of the Gall Bladder channel with the Stomach channel which descends through the nipple. Excessive worry, anger, frustration, resentment or depression may lead to stagnation and knotting of Liver qi, or accumulated heat in the Stomach channel may gather at the breast, leading to breast pain, breast abscess, and failure of the breast milk to flow. Jiānjǐng GB-21 may be selected in all these situations.

Summary of clinical application
For stiffness of the neck and shoulders (due to any aetiology) which may extend to the back or arm.
Descends qi: cough, dyspnoea, rebellion of qi, difficult labour.
Resolves phlegm: hemiplegia, loss of speech following windstroke, windstroke, scrofula, goitre.
