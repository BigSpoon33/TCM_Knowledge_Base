## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Chapter 21 of the Spiritual Pivot lists five points known as the points of the Window of Heaven (Rényíng ST-9, Fútú L.I.-18, Tiānyǒu SJ-16, Tiānzhù BL-10 and Tiānfǔ LU-3). Chapter 2 of the same text gives an unnamed list of ten points which includes the five Window of Heaven points and adds the points Tiāntú REN-22, Tiānchuāng SI-16, Tiānróng SI-17, Fēngfǔ DU-16 and Tiānchí P-1. This passage first discusses Tiāntú REN-22, and then the six yang channel points as a sequence of vertical lines spreading from the Conception vessel and ending with Fēngfǔ DU-16 on the Governing vessel, with Tiānfǔ LU-3 and Tiānchí P-1 as additional points. Later commentators (particularly Ma Shi, the great physician of the Ming dynasty and expert on the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic) pointed out that this passage discusses Tiānróng SI-17 as a point of shaoyang channel whereas in fact it is a point of the hand taiyang channel. They therefore suggested that Tiānróng SI-17 should in fact be Tiānchōng GB-9. If so, all the six yang channels would then be represented.

These ten points have certain common properties, being indicated especially for disharmony between the head and body, disorders of the head and sense organs, goitre and scrofula, rebellion of Lung or Stomach qi and emotional disorders.

Many classics indicate Tiānchōng GB-9 for a variety of mental and psychological diseases characterised by propensity to fear and fright, fright palpitations, epilepsy, madness etc. According to modern acupuncture research in psychiatric hospitals, many head points are effective in treating disorders of the underlying portion of the brain, and this may help explain these traditional indications.

Summary of clinical application
Some commentators believe this to be one of the ten points of the Window of Heaven rather than Tiānróng SI-17.
For propensity to fear and fright, fright palpitations, epilepsy and madness.
