## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the Essential Questions6 "The Gall Bladder is the upright official from where judgement emanates". When the characters for sun and moon (the name of this point) are combined, they form a new character 'ming' which means 'clear', intelligent' or 'to understand'. 'Ming' describes the quality of judgement emanating from a healthy Gall Bladder. R√¨yu√® GB-24 has traditionally been ascribed the ability to rectify deficiency patterns of the Gall Bladder and was indicated as early as the Essential Questions (with D«énsh≈´ BL-19) for the treatment of Gall Bladder deficiency giving rise to indecisiveness, and elsewhere for sighing with a tendency to sadness.

R√¨yu√® GB-24 was established as the front-mu point of the Gall Bladder by the time of the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic. Although many centuries later the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion designated Zh√©jƒ´n GB-23 as the Gall Bladder front-mu point, it is R√¨yu√® GB-24 which has retained this status to the present day. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body. R√¨yu√® GB-24 is an important point to treat diseases of the Gall Bladder fu which may derive from the following three aetologies: i. emotional disharmony results in stagnation of Liver qi which impairs the circulation of qi in its interiorly-exteriorly related Gall Bladder channel, and gives rise to distention, fullness and pain of the lateral costal region, sighing and a sensation of heat in the lower abdomen; ii. disharmony of the Stomach and Spleen transportation and transformation function leads to accumulation of dampness which transforms to damp-heat and ferments in the Liver and Gall Bladder; bile does not flow and seeps into the muscles and skin giving rise to jaundice; iii. Gall Bladder qi invades the Stomach and interferes with its descending function resulting in vomiting, acid regurgitation, hiccup and epigastric pain. All these three patterns may be encountered in diseases such as cholecystitis, cholelithiasis and hepatitis.

Summary of clinical application
Tonifies Gall Bladder qi: indecisiveness, sighing with a tendency to sadness.
Resolves Gall Bladder qi stagnation, Gall Bladder damp-heat and disharmony of the Gall Bladder and Stomach: distention, fullness and pain of the lateral costal region, abdominal distention, jaundice, vomiting, acid regurgitation, hiccup, epigastric pain.
