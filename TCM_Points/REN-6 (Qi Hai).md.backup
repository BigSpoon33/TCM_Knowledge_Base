## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Qìhǎi REN-6, like Guānyuán REN-4, is also known by the name of 'Dantian' (Cinnabar Field). This reflects its location in the vital centre of the body where the deepest energies are stored and generated, and which plays a pivotal role in the treatment of disease and in Chinese martial arts and qigong practices. (For a fuller discussion of the dantian see the commentary on Guānyuán REN-4).

The name Qihai (Sea of Qi) emphasises the principal difference between Qìhǎi REN-6 and Guānyuán REN-4. Whilst both have a powerful action on tonifying the Kidneys, the forte of Qìhǎi REN-6 is generating qi and yang and it does not share the yin and blood nourishing qualities of Guānyuán REN-4.

According to the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Qìhǎi REN-6 is indicated for deficiency of the original qi and for qi deficiency of all the five zang. In fact the original qi is considered to be the basis for the formation and activity of all the zangfu. This concept is explained in the Classic of Difficulties 11 which states "The dynamic qi that moves between the Kidneys is [the basis] of human life, the source of the five zang and six fu, the root of the twelve channels, the door of respiration and the origin of the sanjiao", and in the Discourse into the Origin and Development of Medicine 12 which says "Original qi is distributed to the five zang and forms the essence of the five zang". Original qi is formed from the combination of pre- and post- heaven qi. In comparison with Zúsānlǐ ST-36 which tonifies the source of post-heaven qi in the Stomach and Spleen, Qìhǎi REN-6 activates and mobilises the pre-heaven qi stored in the Kidneys. It is thus indicated in the widest possible range of disorders involving qi deficiency and exhaustion. By promoting the pre-heaven qi, Qìhǎi REN-6 is able to foster the post-heaven qi of the Stomach and Spleen and is thus indicated for emaciation and feebleness of the muscles and diarrhoea. By warming and firming the Kidney yang, Qìhǎi REN-6 is able to treat impotence, seminal emission, cold illness and dark face. By promoting the central qi, Qìhǎi REN-6 is able to treat prolapse of the rectum and uterus. So strong are its qi and yang restoring properties that it is a vital point for rescuing yang in cases of collapse with a slow and minute pulse. For this purpose strong moxibustion either by moxa stick or by large moxa cones mediated by sliced fresh ginger or aconite cake is administered. Zhu Dan-xi of the Jin-Yuan dynasty describes a case of "yin depletion followed by sudden expiry of yang" with pouring sweat, faint respiration, urinary incontinence and a large irregular and arrhythmic pulse. He applied moxa to Qìhǎi REN-6"with the moxa cones as big as the small finger. When the eighteenth cone was burned up, his right hand was able to move. Another three cones and his lips began to move a little". He also describes a case of violent diarrhoea resulting in loss of consciousness and extremely faint breathing as if on the verge of death. Moxa was performed at Qìhǎi REN-6 without delay13. The ability of Qìhǎi REN-6 to treat disorders of profound deficiency is further reflected in its designation in the Spiritual Pivot 14 as the shu point of the 'huang'. The huang, which refers to the area just above the diaphragm and which also appears in the name of Gāohuāngshū BL-43, implies one of the deepest and most vital regions of the body.

It is important to emphasise that due to its intimate relationship with the qi, Qìhǎi REN-6 is equally important in the treatment of diseases due to qi stagnation affecting the lower jiao. It is indicated for distention and pain of the abdomen, constipation, qi stagnation due to pathogenic cold giving rise to retraction of the testicles, and cold pain of the abdomen. Since "qi is the master of blood" Qìhǎi REN-6 is also indicated for abdominal masses whether due to stagnation of qi or stasis of blood.

By virtue of its dual actions of tonifying and regulating qi, Qìhǎi REN-6 is able to treat a variety of gynaecological disorders. Uterine bleeding, persistent flow of lochia and post-partum bleeding may be due to failure of the qi to hold the blood, and along with irregular menstruation and dysmenorrhoea may also involve blood stasis, either as a sequela of haemorrhage or as a consequence of qi stagnation.
