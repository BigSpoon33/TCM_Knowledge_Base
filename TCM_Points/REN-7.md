## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Yīnjiāo REN-7 (Yin Intersection) is a meeting point of the Conception and Penetrating vessels with the Kidney channel, all of which have an intimate relationship with the uterus. The Conception vessel, known as the 'sea of the yin channels' and the Penetrating vessel, known as the 'sea of blood', both originate in the uterus in women and their maturation depends on the flourishing of the Kidneys. The Essential Questions 15 states "At the age of fourteen, the gui16 matures, the Conception vessel flows and the Penetrating vessel fills, the menses come according to their times, thus conception is possible". Disorders of menstruation may be of excess or deficiency type, due to cold or heat, exterior pathogens or interior disharmony. Due to the close relationship of Yīnjiāo REN-7 to the uterus however, it may be used to treat such disorders as irregular menstruation, amenorrhoea, uterine bleeding, persistent flow of lochia or infertility due to any aetiology.

The Conception vessel emerges at the perineum and ascends through the genital region, whilst the Penetrating vessel emerges at Qìchōng ST-30 and ascends the lower abdomen. Both channels therefore have a strong influence on the lower abdomen and genitals, and Yīnjiāo REN-7 is indicated for such disorders as pain, retraction, itching and sweating of the genitals, shan disorder and abdominal and umbilical pain.

Finally, like several points which affect the Penetrating vessel, Yīnjiāo REN-7 is indicated for running piglet qi (see Qìchōng ST-30).
