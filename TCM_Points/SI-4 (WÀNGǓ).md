## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Wàngǔ SI-4 is the yuan-source point of the Small Intestine channel. Its main clinical application is in the treatment of contraction, stiffness and pain along the entire length of the channel including the hand, elbow, arm, shoulder, neck and back. It is one of the main points (along with Yángxī L.I.-5, Zhōngzhǔ SJ-3 and Zhīzhèng SI-7) to treat disorders of all the five fingers, especially when characterised by contraction and pain.

Wàngǔ SI-4 has a specific effect in the treatment of swelling at the opposite end of the channel, especially the neck, cheek and submandibular region. Like all the previous points of this channel it is also indicated in the treatment of tinnitus, reflecting the pathways of the Small Intestine primary and sinew channels which enter the ear. This is an example of the use of acupuncture points to treat disorders of the channel rather than underlying zangfu disharmony, and Wàngǔ SI-4 may therefore be used in tinnitus due to any aetiology. Wàngǔ SI-4 is specifically indicated in combination (see below) to treat pain and swelling of the submandibular region radiating to the ear and giving rise to tinnitus.

Finally, Wàngǔ SI-4 has been found to be empirically effective in the treatment of different kinds of jaundice, whether due to damp-heat or cold damp, as well as pain of the lateral costal region with inability to catch the breath. This action cannot easily be explained, either by reference to the channel pathway or to the functions of the Small Intestine.
