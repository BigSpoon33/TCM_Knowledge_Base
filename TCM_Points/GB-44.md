## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The name of Zúqiàoyīn GB-44 (Yin Portals of the Foot) is said to refer to its ability to treat diseases of the sense organs associated with the five zang, namely the eyes (Liver), ears (Kidneys), tongue (Heart), mouth (Spleen) and nose (Lung). In fact, classical indications appear for all of these except the nose. In this respect, Zúqiàoyīn GB-44 on the lower body mirrors Tóuqiàoyīn GB-11 (Yin Portals of the Head) in the upper body.

Zúqiàoyīn GB-44 is the jing-well, and therefore most distal, point of the Gall Bladder channel. According to the Spiritual Pivot23 "for diseases of the head select [points from] the feet". Zúqiàoyīn GB-44 has long been cited by numerous classical sources for disorders due to Gall Bladder fire rising to disturb the head, or exterior wind-heat attacking the head, giving rise to symptoms such as headache, headache with agitation, sudden deafness, tinnitus, dizziness, swollen red and painful eyes and throat painful obstruction. As the terminal, and therefore most dynamic point of the channel, Zúqiàoyīn GB-44 is especially indicated when these conditions are severe and acute.

The Classic of Difficulties24 states that jing-well points treat "fullness below the Heart". Whilst the region 'below the Heart' specifically refers to the apex of the epigastrium, like many of the jing-well points Zúqiàoyīn GB-44 treats stagnation and fullness throughout the chest region. When Liver qi stagnates in the chest and lateral costal region there can be distention and pain. Zúqiàoyīn GB-44 is the metal point of the Gall Bladder channel and its use was emphasised in classics such as the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion for pain of the lateral costal region with cough and inability to catch the breath. These symptoms occur when Liver qi or Liver fire invade the Lung (wood insults metal).

The Gall Bladder divergent channel links with the Heart, and wood is the 'mother' of fire. Gall Bladder fire, therefore, may easily transmit to the Heart and disrupt the spirit (disease of the mother affecting the child). In common with many of the jing-well points, Zúqiàoyīn GB-44 is effective to calm the spirit and like other jing-well points of the feet (e.g. Lìduì ST-45 and Yǐnbài SP-1) to treat disorders of sleep such as insomnia and nightmares. In discussing Zúqiàoyīn GB-44, the Investigation into Points Along the Channels said "[for] Gall Bladder heat somnolence reduce it, [for] Gall Bladder cold insomnia reinforce it".

Finally, unlike the majority of the jing-well points of the twelve channels, Zúqiàoyīn GB-44 does not appear to be indicated in the major classics for restoring consciousness.

Summary of clinical application
For severe and acute attack of Gall Bladder fire or wind-heat in the head: headache, sudden deafness, tinnitus, dizziness, swelling, redness and pain of the eyes, throat painful obstruction.
For pain of the lateral costal region with cough and inability to catch the breath.
