## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Although rarely used clinically, it is interesting to note that Jiǎosūn SJ-20 was traditionally indicated, and appeared in combination, for swelling and pain of the gums, dryness of the lips, inability to chew, toothache and tooth decay, and as such may be viewed as a useful adjacent point for such disorders. As far as stiffness of the lips is concerned, it is notable that of the few points that are traditionally said to treat these disorders, the majority (for example Jiǎosūn SJ-20, Ěrmén SJ-21, Shàngguān GB-3, Zhèngyíng GB-17) are in the region of the ear. Summary of clinical application Traditionally indicated for swelling and pain of the gums, dryness of the lips, inability to chew, toothache and tooth decay. Also for ear disorders: tinnitus, deafness, discharge of pus from the ear, redness and swelling of the back of the ear, redness and swelling of the auricle.
