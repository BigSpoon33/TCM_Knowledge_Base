## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

The two principal actions of L√¨du√¨ ST-45 are to clear heat from the Stomach channel (and to a certain extent the Stomach fu) and to clear heat and calm the spirit. In addition, in common with all the jing-well points, L√¨du√¨ ST-45 may be used to restore consciousness. According to the Spiritual Pivot42 "When the disease is above select [points] from below". This statement emphasises the strong action that the most distal channel points have on treating disorders at the opposite end of the channel. L√¨du√¨ ST-45 is especially indicated when yangming channel heat rises to the face, nose, teeth and lips, giving rise to such symptoms as swelling of the face, toothache, cracked lips, nosebleed, yellow nasal discharge etc. It is also indicated for heat in the Stomach fu giving rise to excessive hunger. The action of L√¨du√¨ ST-45 in clearing heat and calming the spirit is shared by many of the points of the Stomach channel. This is explained both by the pathway of the Stomach divergent channel to the Heart and that of the primary channel which joins with the Governing vessel at Sh√©nt√≠ng DU-24 and R√©nzh≈çng DU-26. L√¨du√¨ ST-45 also shares with the jing-well points as a whole a special ability to calm the spirit, especially in acute situations. It is indicated in the treatment of manic disorders characterised in classical texts by the indications "desires to ascend to high places and sing, discards clothing and runs around", and is especially used for insomnia with excessive dreaming due to fire or phlegm-heat. Its action on insomnia is shared by several of the jing-well points of the feet (Y«ênb√†i SP-1, Y«íngqu«én KID-1 and Z√∫qi√†oyƒ´n GB-44), reflecting the perception that in order to induce sleep, pathologically ascending qi, yang or fire must be drawn downwards. In severe intractable cases of insomnia, moxibustion may be applied to L√¨du√¨ ST-45. This technique of 'drawing the fire down' is based on the principle 'small fire attracts big fire'. In common with many acupuncture points, L√¨du√¨ ST-45 has a homeostatic action, and may also be used for depressive disorders characterised by withdrawal and excessive desire to sleep, thus emphasising its ability to calm and regulate the spirit in a variety of situations. Summary of clinical application Clears heat from the upper reaches of the channel: swelling of the face, toothache, lockjaw, throat painful obstruction, cracked lips, deviation of the mouth, nosebleed, yellow nasal discharge, heat in the head. Clears heat, calms the spirit and restores consciousness: excessive dreaming, easily frightened with desire to sleep, insomnia, dizziness, mania-depression, desires to ascend to high places and sing, discards clothing and runs around, loss of consciousness.
