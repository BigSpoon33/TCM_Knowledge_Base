## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

The term 'shang' in the name of this point is the note associated with the metal phase in an ancient musical notation system, whilst 'yang' denotes the yang channel and serves to differentiate this point from Sh√†oshƒÅng LU-11 'Lesser Shang'. ShƒÅngy√°ng L.I.-1 is the metal point of the Large Intestine metal channel.

As the most distal point of the Large Intestine channel, ShƒÅngy√°ng L.I.-1 has an urgent effect on resolving heat, swelling and pain at the opposite end of the channel, most frequently due to attack of wind-heat or accumulation of fire poison. According to the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries "the root of the hand yangming is ShƒÅngy√°ng L.I.-1 and it knots at F√∫t√∫ L.I.-18 and PiƒÅnl√¨ L.I.-6". This statement emphasises the special affinity of this point for the ear (which is reached by the Large Intestine luo-connecting channel from PiƒÅnl√¨ L.I.-6), reflected in its indications for tinnitus and deafness. In addition, the Large Intestine primary channel traverses the lower part of the cheek and enters the lower jaw, whilst the Large Intestine divergent channel ascends along the throat. ShƒÅngy√°ng L.I.-1 is therefore used for disorders of these regions characterised by severe and sudden swelling, heat and pain, for example toothache of the lower jaw, throat painful obstruction and swelling of the submandibular region. The ability of ShƒÅngy√°ng L.I.-1 to dynamically clear heat has a wider application in the treatment of febrile diseases, and especially malaria.

In common with the other jing-well points, ShƒÅngy√°ng L.I.-1 is used to revive from collapse and is indicated for loss of consciousness (from windstroke).

A branch of the Lung channel terminates at ShƒÅngy√°ng L.I.-1 and as the metal point of the yang metal channel, it is indicated for fullness characterised by qi stagnation in the Lung, which may i. radiate to the lateral costal region, and ii. give rise to dyspnoea and coughing. In respect of this ability to clear fullness from the chest region, ShƒÅngy√°ng L.I.-1 is typical of the jing-well points.

Finally the Large Intestine muscle and divergent channels both connect with the spine, and ShƒÅngy√°ng L.I.-1 is indicated for pain of the shoulder and back which radiates to the supraclavicular fossa.

Summary of clinical application
Resolves heat, swelling and pain at the opposite end of the channel: disorders of the ears (deafness, tinnitus), throat (throat painful obstruction), teeth (toothache of the lower jaw), lower cheek (pain), submandibular region (swelling).
Jing-well point hence restores consciousness, e.g. loss of consciousness (from windstroke).
