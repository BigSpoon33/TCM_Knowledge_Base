## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Wàiqiū GB-36 is the xi-cleft point of the Gall Bladder channel. The xi-cleft points are where the qi and blood, which flow relatively superficially along the channels from the jing-well points, gather and plunge more deeply. The xi-cleft points in general are indicated in the treatment of acute conditions and pain, and Wàiqiū GB-36 is indicated for pain of the skin. Thus the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion said "Painful skin with atrophy disorder and painful obstruction, principally select Wàiqiū GB-36".

Unusually, this point is also indicated for rabies. The Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man said "Rabies with chills and fever, quickly moxa Wàiqiū GB-36 three times and then moxa the bitten area".

Summary of clinical application
Xi-cleft point of the Gall Bladder hence indicated for acute conditions and pain: pain of the skin, and rabies with chills and fever.
Also indicated for distention of the chest and lateral costal region, pigeon chest in children, headache, mania, abdominal pain, atrophy disorder and painful obstruction of the lower limb, cold damp leg qi, cold sensation and stiffness and pain of the nape and neck, aversion to wind-cold.
