## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Despite the compelling name of this point (Hall of the Spirit) and the fact that Shéntáng BL-44 lies on the outer Bladder channel at the level of Xīnshū BL-15, the back-shu point of the Heart, there are no apparent references in any of the important classics of acupuncture to the use of this point for the treatment of emotional or psychological disorders.

According to the Essential Questions62 the five outer Bladder points level with the five zang back-shu points (i.e. Pòhù BL-42, Shéntáng BL-44, Húnmén BL-47, Yìshè BL-49 and Zhìshì BL-52) drain heat from the five zang, an action shared by the back-shu points of the five zang.

Summary of clinical application
Unbinds the chest and treats pain of the upper back: cough, asthma, dyspnoea, fullness of the chest with rebellious qi, stiffness and pain of the back, pain of the shoulder and back that radiates to the chest.
