## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

The Governing vessel is the 'sea of the yang channels' and many of its points are effective to reduce yang heat in the body, including febrile diseases and most especially malaria. In both traditional and modern clinical practice T√°od√†o DU-13 has been an important point in the treatment of malaria, whether acute or chronic. This is primarily due to its ability to clear heat from the Governing vessel, and this action is reflected also in the indications for chills and fever and steaming bone disorder.

Like many points of the Governing vessel, T√°od√†o DU-13 is also able to regulate the channel and to clear wind and is indicated for stiffness of the spine, heaviness of the head and clonic spasm.

Finally, as its name 'Way of Happiness' suggests, T√°od√†o DU-13 is indicated for unhappiness and disorientation.

Summary of clinical application
Important point in the treatment of malaria as well as other diseases involving chills and fever; also absence of sweating, steaming bone disorder.
