## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Huìyīn REN-1 (Meeting of Yin) derives its name from its location in the area between the anus and the external genitalia (the two lower yin) and the fact that the perineum is where the Conception and Penetrating vessels meet (with the Governing vessel). It is also directly beneath and opposite to Bǎihuì DU-20 (the point at which all the yang gathers) and hence the deep, dark, hidden and protected place where yin meets. This is reflected in the importance of Huìyīn REN-1 in qigong practice. In the practice of small heavenly circuit rotation, qi is focused in the lower dantian (cinnabar field), directed to Huìyīn REN-1 and then to Chángqiáng DU-1 before being directed up the Governing vessel to Bǎihuì DU-20 and then down the Conception vessel to return to the lower dantian.

Historically there has been some discussion as to whether Huìyīn REN-1 rather than Jiūwéi REN-15 is the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel. The Spiritual Pivot 3 refers to the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel as Weiyi (Tail Screen), an alternative name for Jiūwéi REN-15, and gives symptoms of excess (pain of the skin of the abdomen) and deficiency (itching of the skin of the abdomen). Later classics, including both the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion refer to the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel as Pingyi (Flat Screen), an alternative name for Huìyīn REN-1, and ascribe these symptoms of excess and deficiency to this point. Huìyīn REN-1 as the luo-connecting point of the Conception vessel would reflect a neat symmetry with Chángqiáng DU-1 as the luo-connecting point of the Governing vessel.

Huìyīn REN-1 has a strong action on the genito-urinary and anal regions, especially in disorders due to damp-heat, and is indicated for genital pain and swelling, as well as recalcitrant urinary disorders. It is unfortunate that due to its location it is clinically less used than it otherwise might be.

Huìyīn REN-1, under its alternative name of Guicang (Ghost Store) is one of the 'thirteen ghost points' of Sun Si-miao, used in the treatment of epilepsy and mania disorder. The Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas in fact specified that in men Yinxiafeng (Extra) should be needled, whilst in women Yumentou (Extra), located at the posterior labial commissure, should be needled. Both points more or less correspond to Huìyīn REN-1.

Finally, Huìyīn REN-1 is indicated (for example in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion) for reviving from drowning and is said to have the ability to promote the expulsion of water from the lungs.
