## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Although this point is most commonly known as Shuidao (Water Passage), the great 7th century physician Sun Si-miao referred to left Shuidao as Baomen (Gate of the Uterus) and right Shuidao as Zihu (Child's Door)14, emphasising its action on gynaecological disorders. These two ways of naming this point reflect its dual actions of clearing stasis from the Bladder and promoting urination on the one hand, and clearing stasis of qi and blood from the uterus on the other. As far as the former action is concerned, Shuǐdào ST-28 is indicated when excess pathogenic factors obstruct the qi transformation function of the Bladder leading to retention of urine. As for the latter action, Shuǐdào ST-28 is particularly indicated for cold congealing the uterus (see Guīlái ST-29 for a fuller discussion) and giving rise to obstruction of blood, manifesting with a variety of symptoms of blood stasis such as dysmenorrhoea, infertility, menstrual pain radiating to the lumbar region or down the thighs, and retention of the placenta or retention of dead foetus. It is also specifically indicated for uterine (jia) masses, implying masses of indefinite form and changing location, primarily due to qi stagnation. The unifying factor between these two spheres of action is obstruction, emphasising that this point is almost exclusively used for excess patterns. Shuǐdào ST-28 is also indicated for pain of the lumbar region and pain of the shoulder and back and appears in at least two classical combinations for this purpose. This is an example of the method of selecting points from the front of the body to treat the back, and also reflects the fact that the Stomach sinew channel passes through the lower ribs and connects with the spine.
