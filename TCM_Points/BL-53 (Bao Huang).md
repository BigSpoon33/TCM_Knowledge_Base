## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Bāohuāng BL-53 is a commonly used point in the treatment of stiffness and pain of the lumbar region and sciatica. Along with Zhìbiān BL-54 and Huántiào GB-30, Bāohuāng BL-53 is one of the points that should be palpated, and needled if tender, in all cases where pain radiates to the buttock and down the leg.

Bāohuāng BL-53 (Bladder's Vitals) lies lateral to Pángguāngshū BL-28, the back-shu point of the Bladder, and in common with many of the points of the sacral region it is able to regulate urination, and to a lesser extent defecation, being indicated for retention of urine, dribbling urination, oedema and inability to urinate or defecate.
