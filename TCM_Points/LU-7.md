## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

The name of this point 'Broken Sequence' is an ancient term for lightning. This name may be understood in three ways: i. the electric sensation that may be generated when needling this point, ii. the ability of Li√®quƒì LU-7 to clear heaviness and oppression of the chest in the way that a lightning storm clears the sky, and iii. the sudden fork in the Lung channel at this point. It is notable that several of the luo-connecting points (for example Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40, Y√°nggƒÅng BL-58, D√†zh≈çng KID-4) are located at sites where the channel suddenly changes direction, and in the case of Li√®quƒì LU-7 this fork takes it almost as far as the pathway of the Large Intestine channel, emphasising the close affinity of this point to the Lung's paired yang channel.

Li√®quƒì LU-7 was included by Ma Dan-yang, the great physician of the Jin dynasty, among the 'eleven heavenly star points'15 his grouping of the most vital acupuncture points, and was indicated by him for one-sided headache, wind painful obstruction and numbness of the whole body, obstruction of phlegm in the upper body, and lockjaw. The Glorious Anthology of Acupuncture and Moxibustion by the Ming dynasty author Gao Wu includes Li√®quƒì LU-7 among the 'four command points' (for disorders of the head and nape). In the Ode Of The Obstructed River the use of Li√®quƒì LU-7 is referred to as one of 'the eight therapeutic methods'. In this description of the application of the eight confluent points of the extraordinary vessels to affect specific symptoms and areas of the body, Li√®quƒì LU-7 is indicated for disorders of the head region, rebellion and blockage of phlegm and dry throat.

The clear emphasis on the ability of Li√®quƒì LU-7 to treat the head and neck region in each of these three point groupings is surprising since the Lung channel does not ascend higher than the throat. The effect of Li√®quƒì LU-7 on the head region as a whole can, however, be explained by the following factors: i. the action of Li√®quƒì LU-7 on expelling and pacifying wind whose nature is to attack the upper portion of the body, and ii. the close connection between Li√®quƒì LU-7, the luo-connecting point of the Lung channel, and its interiorly-exteriorly related Large Intestine channel which does ascend to the head.

Li√®quƒì LU-7 is an important point in the treatment of wind disorders, whether of exterior or interior origin. According to both the Spiritual Pivot16 and the Essential Questions17 "Taiyin is the opening, jueyin is the closing and shaoyin is the pivot". The Lung (taiyin), which communicates directly with the exterior via respiration, and indirectly through its close relationship with the skin of the whole body, is the most open and vulnerable of the zang to attack by exterior pathogens. When exterior pathogenic wind, in combination with heat, cold or dryness, attacks the superficial portion of the body, it has three principal effects: i. it may obstruct the defensive qi and impair the disseminating function of the Lung, giving rise to the classic signs of an exterior pattern such as chills and fever, headache, aches and pains in the neck, shoulders and back etc., ii. it may impair the descending function of the Lung, resulting in coughing, wheezing and asthma, and iii. it may interfere with the Lung's function of regulating the water passages and descending fluids to the Bladder, resulting in acute swelling of the limbs. Li√®quƒì LU-7 is not only the luo-connecting point of the Lung channel, communicating with the yang Large Intestine channel, but is also the point where a branch of the Lung primary channel diverges to link with ShƒÅngy√°ng L.I.-1 on the index finger. Due to this close connection with the Lung channel's yang (exterior) paired channel, Li√®quƒì LU-7 is the most exterior-acting of the Lung channel points and is the principal point on the channel to release the exterior, promote the function of the Lungs in dispersing and descending, and regulate the water passages.

"Wind is characterised by upward and outward dispersion". This saying of Chinese medicine means that wind tends to attack both the upper and exterior portions of the body. As well as releasing wind from the exterior, Li√®quƒì LU-7 is able to clear both exterior and interior wind from the head and upper body in the treatment of disorders such as facial paralysis, lockjaw, epilepsy, toothache and headache. Its ability to treat the head, and in particular the yangming facial area, again reflects its close connection with the Large Intestine channel, a concept emphasised in the Guide to the Classic of Acupuncture which states "the luo-connecting points are located between two channels ... if they are punctured, symptoms of the interiorly-exteriorly related channels can be treated"18. The wind-expelling action of Li√®quƒì LU-7 is also reflected in its classical use in the treatment of wind painful obstruction and numbness of the whole body.

The ability of Li√®quƒì LU-7 to pacify interior wind is complemented by its action of descending phlegm. Wind-phlegm (the combination of interior wind and phlegm) is a common pattern underlying disorders such as epilepsy, lockjaw, facial paralysis and hemiplegia for which this point is indicated. In Lung disorders, failure of the Lung to disseminate and descend body fluids results in accumulation of phlegm in the chest and Li√®quƒì LU-7 is also indicated for coughing phlegm and vomiting of foamy (watery) saliva.

From the earliest times Li√®quƒì LU-7 has been an important point in the treatment of headaches, for example the Ode of Spiritual Brightness states "in treating headache, whether one-sided or not, reduce Li√®quƒì LU-7". Whilst this action can in part be explained by the ability of Li√®quƒì LU-7 to expel and pacify wind, as well as by its connection with the Large Intestine channel, this is predominantly an example of the fruits of long empirical observation.

Li√®quƒì LU-7 is the confluent point of the Conception vessel, which ascends along the anterior midline of the body and is closely related to the uterus and the genito-urinary organs. By opening and regulating the flow of qi in the Conception vessel, Li√®quƒì LU-7 is able to treat such symptoms as retention of the lochia and dead foetus, pain of the genitals and urinary disorders. Its effect on a wide range of urinary disorders such as blood in the urine, and hot, painful and difficult urination, further reflects the important function of the Lung in regulating the water passages, especially descending fluids to the Bladder.

Li√®quƒì LU-7 shares with the other luo-connecting points of the yin channels (G≈çngs≈´n SP-4, T≈çngl«ê HE-5, D√†zh≈çng KID-4, L«êg≈çu LIV-5 and N√®iguƒÅn P-6) the special ability to treat psycho-emotional disorders, and is indicated for propensity to laughter, frequent yawning and stretching and especially for poor memory.

As far as disorders of the Lung channel are concerned, Li√®quƒì LU-7 treats heat in the palms and shoulder pain, but is particularly important for pain of the thumb joint and index finger. For this purpose it is needled towards the hand and manipulated to transmit sensation to the diseased area, whilst for all other purposes, Li√®quƒì LU-7 is generally needled proximally towards the elbow.

Finally the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion gives specific indications for excess and deficiency of the luo-connecting points. In the case of Li√®quƒì LU-7, these are heat of the chest and back, sweating, sudden swelling of the four limbs (excess); shivering and cold of the chest and back, diminished qi and shortness of breath (deficiency).

Summary of clinical application
Principal Lung channel point to release the exterior and disperse and descend Lung qi: chills and fever, acute swelling of the limbs, nasal congestion and discharge, throat painful obstruction, cough, wheezing, dyspnoea, asthma.
Subdues interior wind and phlegm and treats the head and neck: headache, stiff neck, one-sided headache, hemiplegia, deviation of the mouth and eye, epilepsy.
‚ÄúIn treating headache, whether one-sided or not, reduce Li√®quƒì LU-7‚Äù (Ode of Spiritual Brightness).
Gao Wu Command point for the head and nape.
Treats the Conception vessel: blood in the urine, hot and painful urination, difficult urination, genital pain, seminal emission.
Poor memory, propensity to laughter, frequent yawning and stretching.
