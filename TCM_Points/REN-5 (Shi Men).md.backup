## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Shímén REN-5 is the front-mu point of the Sanjiao. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body. The Essential Questions says "the Sanjiao is the official in charge of drainage and controls the water passages" 9, the Classic of Difficulties says "the Sanjiao is the pathway of water and grain" 10 and the Classic of Categories states "when the lower jiao is not treated there is water disorder in the bowels and Bladder". Shímén REN-5 is indicated for stagnation of fluids characterised by difficult urination or retention of urine, painful urinary dysfunction and oedema, as well as for diarrhoea, undigested food in the stool and dysenteric disorder.

Shímén REN-5 is also able to regulate qi stagnation and alleviate pain in the lower abdomen and genital region and is strongly indicated in the treatment of conditions such as twisting pain of the lower abdomen, shan disorder with severe periumbilical pain, abdominal distention, and retraction, swelling and pain of the genitals.

In colloquial Chinese a woman who is infertile is known as a 'stone woman', whilst the name Shimen means 'Stone Gate' or 'Stone Door'. An alternative name for this point is Jueyun (Infertility). These names refer to the unique quality classically attributed to this point of inducing infertility. Texts such as the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, the Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man and the Illustrated Supplement to the Classic of Categories all warn that needling this point can make a woman infertile for life. Modern acupuncture texts, however, make no mention of this warning. The effect of Shímén REN-5 on regulating the function of the uterus and adjusting menstruation is further illustrated by its indications for persistent flow of lochia, abdominal masses, uterine bleeding and leucorrhoea.

Finally, although indicated for deficiency-taxation and lower origin (yuan) deficient and cold, compared with its neighbouring points Guānyuán REN-4 and Qìhǎi REN-6, Shímén REN-5 is notable for the absence of indications of deficiency, and is principally indicated for excess patterns.

Summary of clinical application
Moves stagnant fluids and drains damp: difficult urination, retention of urine, painful urinary dysfunction, oedema, diarrhoea, undigested food in the stool, dysenteric disorder.
Regulates qi in the lower jiao: twisting pain of the lower abdomen, shan disorder with severe periumbilical pain, abdominal distention, retraction, swelling and pain of the genitals.
Traditionally thought to induce infertility. Also for persistent flow of lochia, abdominal masses, uterine bleeding, leucorrhoea.
