## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

The Classic of Difficulties27 said "On the left is the Kidney, on the right is ming men" whilst according to Zhang Jing-yue "Ming men resides between the Kidneys". The exact location of ming men (Gate of Life) has been described differently at different times, but as its name makes clear, M√¨ngm√©n DU-4, located between the Kidney back-shu points, is an important point to influence the ming men and the ministerial fire to which it is closely related. As well as influencing the ming men fire, M√¨ngm√©n DU-4 is a point of the Governing vessel, which is known as the 'sea of the yang channels', and therefore has a strong regulatory effect on the yang qi and the exterior portion of the body. These two considerations help explain the fact that the indications given for M√¨ngm√©n DU-4 in classical texts emphasise the treatment of heat disorders, whether interior or exterior, excess or deficient. M√¨ngm√©n DU-4 is able to drain heat manifesting as 'heat in the body like fire', steaming bone disorder and malaria. According to the Classic of Difficulties, the ministerial fire is the "root of the five zang". M√¨ngm√©n DU-4 is specifically indicated for heat of the five zang and shares this special indication with Xƒ´nsh≈´ BL-15, the back-shu point of the Heart which dominates sovereign fire.

An alternative name for this point is Jinggong (Palace of Essence). The Governing vessel ascends through the spinal cord and enters the brain (the sea of marrow) as well as entering the Kidneys. M√¨ngm√©n DU-4 is indicated for such manifestations of Kidney essence deficiency as shaking of the head, tinnitus and dizziness, and this reflects the ability of M√¨ngm√©n DU-4 both to strengthen the Kidneys, and to open the Governing vessel and assist the ascent of essence. According to the Classic of Difficulties28 "When the Governing vessel is diseased, symptoms such as opisthotonos and fainting may occur". M√¨ngm√©n DU-4 is able to pacify wind in the Governing vessel, reflected in indications such as opisthotonos, splitting headache and epilepsy.

The Governing vessel dominates the spinal column, the pillar of the body, and as reflects its location M√¨ngm√©n DU-4 has its strongest action on the lumbar region. It may be used for rigidity and stiffness of the lumbar spine and is strongly indicated in classical sources for lumbar pain due to any kind of deficiency, especially of the Kidneys.

According to the Classic of Difficulties29 "The ming men is the residence of essence ... and stores semen in the male and connects with the uterus in the female". The anterior pathway of the Governing vessel encircles the genitals, and M√¨ngm√©n DU-4 is indicated for such disorders as seminal emission, white turbidity and leucorrhoea.

The Governing vessel winds around the anus, and like several of the lower points of this channel, M√¨ngm√©n DU-4 is indicated for prolapse of the rectum, haemorrhoids and blood in the stool.

Despite the common perception of M√¨ngm√©n DU-4 as a major point to tonify and warm the ming men fire, it is remarkable that there are no clear classical indications for Kidney yang deficiency (compared for example with Sh√®nsh≈´ BL-23, GuƒÅnyu√°n REN-4 and Q√¨h«éi REN-6). Interestingly, however, the classical combinations for this point much more strongly emphasise its yang tonifying properties (see below).

Finally, according to qigong theory, there are three important gates or passes (sanguan) in the practice of qi circulation through the Governing vessel. These gates, through which it is more difficult to circulate the qi are the Coccyx Pass (Weiluguan) in the region of Ch√°ngqi√°ng DU-1, the Lumbar Pass (Jiajiguan) in the region of M√¨ngm√©n DU-4, and the Occipital Pass (Yuzhenwan) in the region of Y√πzhƒõn BL-9.
