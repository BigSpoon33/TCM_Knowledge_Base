## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Zh≈çngch≈çng P-9 is the jing-well point of the Pericardium channel, and in common with many of the jing-well points (the terminal and most dynamic point of the channel) has a powerful effect to restore consciousness. There are some particular differences, however, that distinguish Zh≈çngch≈çng P-9 from the other jing-well points. Firstly, located on the middle finger, this is the most distal of all the jing-well points and the only one located in the centre rather than at the corner of the nail. Secondly, as a point of the Pericardium channel, Zh≈çngch≈çng P-9 is especially suitable for restoring consciousness, which occurs when the spirit is dislodged from the Heart.

Loss of consciousness with stiffness of the tongue may occur during the course of febrile diseases when pathogenic heat, complicated with phlegm, collapses into the Pericardium. The affinity of Zh≈çngch≈çng P-9 for the tongue, reflected in such classical indications as pain at the root of the tongue, stiffness of the tongue and inability to speak, underlines the intimate relationship that was held to exist between the Pericardium and the Heart, since it is the Heart which flowers into the tongue and the Heart (luo-connecting) channel rather than the Pericardium channel that travels to the root of the tongue.

Like several points of the Pericardium channel, Zh≈çngch≈çng P-9 also treats injury by summer-heat characterised by fever, agitation, vomiting, diarrhoea and collapse.

The Pericardium primary and divergent channels traverse all three jiao and the Pericardium is interiorly-exteriorly coupled with the Sanjiao channel. Like many points of the Pericardium channel, therefore, Zh≈çngch≈çng P-9 also has a strong action on the middle jiao and is indicated for vomiting and diarrhoea, epigastric pain and sudden turmoil disorder. In the treatment of paediatric disorders, it may be used for night-time crying in children and childhood nutritional impairment. Among other patterns, the former may be due to accumulated heat in the Heart and the latter to heat and blockage in the middle jiao.

Summary of clinical application
Jing-well point to restore consciousness, especially in febrile disease.
Treats pain at the root of the tongue, stiffness of the tongue, inability to speak, night-time crying in children.
Treats summer-heat characterised by fever, agitation, vomiting, diarrhoea and collapse.
