## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion this point rather than Rìyuè GB-24 is the front-mu point of the Gall Bladder, and an alternative name for Zhéjīn GB-23 given in this classic was Danmu i.e. 'Gall Bladder Mu'. In fact the classical indications for Zhéjīn GB-23 and Rìyuè GB-24 are very similar, with a greater emphasis on disorders of the chest in the case of Zhéjīn GB-23 reflecting its higher location.

Excessive anger, frustration and resentment, especially when not spontaneously expressed, will impair the free-flowing function of the Liver. Qi stagnates along the course of the Gall Bladder channel in the lateral costal region, and binds the chest, restricting its smooth expansion and contraction. Breathing is impaired leading to fullness and pain, sighing and sadness. Zhéjīn GB-23 is an important local point used in the treatment of these conditions. If stagnation of qi transforms to fire it may affect the upper jiao (Heart) giving rise to sleep disturbance, the middle jiao leading to vomiting and acid regurgitation, or the lower jiao giving rise to heat of the lower abdomen.

Moves stagnant qi: fullness of the chest, pain of the lateral costal region, dyspnoea, asthma, sighing and tendency to sadness, insomnia.
