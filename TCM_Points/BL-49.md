## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Y√¨sh√® BL-49 is level with P√≠sh≈´ BL-20, the back-shu point of the Spleen. Despite its name (Abode of Thought), psychological and emotional indications are notable by their absence in major classical texts.

Y√¨sh√® BL-49 is able to clear damp-heat (reddish-yellow urine, heat in the body with yellow face and eyes) and regulate disharmony of the Stomach (vomiting, difficult ingestion) and Spleen (abdominal distention and fullness, slippery diarrhoea).

In the light of its proximity to the pancreas, it is interesting to note the inclusion of this point in a number of classical combinations for wasting and thirsting disorder.

According to the Essential Questions65 the five outer Bladder points level with the five zang back-shu points (i.e. P√≤h√π BL-42, Sh√©nt√°ng BL-44, H√∫nm√©n BL-47, Y√¨sh√® BL-49 and Zh√¨sh√¨ BL-52) drain heat from the five zang, an action shared by the back-shu points of the five zang.

Summary of clinical application
Clears damp-heat from the three jiao and treats the Spleen and Stomach: distention and fullness of the abdomen, distention and pain of the chest and lateral costal region, slippery diarrhoea, difficult ingestion, vomiting, reddish-yellow urine, heat in the body with yellow face and eyes.
