## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the Essential Questions9 Yúnmén LU-2 is one of the eight points for draining heat from the extremities (although in fact only seven are listed, since Yāoshū DU-2 is on the midline) namely Yúnmén LU-2, Jiānyú L.I.-15, Wěizhōng BL-40 and Yāoshū DU-2. This is reflected in the indication for this point found in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion "injury by cold giving rise to persistent heat in the limbs".

Summary of clinical application
Rarely used, except for pain in the antero-medial portion of the shoulder.
