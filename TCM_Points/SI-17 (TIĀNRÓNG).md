## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

In the Spiritual Pivot Tianrong was classified as a point of the Gall Bladder channel, whilst in the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion it was listed as belonging to the Sanjiao channel. It was not until the 10th century classic Secrets of a Frontier Official, that Tianrong was finally ascribed to the Small Intestine channel.

The point Tiānróng SI-17 is discussed in the chapter 'Needling Methods and Upright and Pathogenic Qi' in the Spiritual Pivot6. According to Qi Bo, the Yellow Emperor's adviser, this point should be needled for "great rebellion of yang qi which rises to fill the chest causing congestion of the chest, agitation and raising of the shoulders ... dyspnoea and wheezing with inability to sit or lie down. In such an illness there is aversion to dust and smoke [as it causes] breathing difficulty as if the throat is blocked", a clear reference to an acute attack of asthma. He compares the speed at which needling this point takes effect to "wiping away the dust".

Tiānróng SI-17 is one of ten points listed in Chapter Two of the Spiritual Pivot that have come to be known as Window of Heaven points. It clearly exemplifies the character and action of these points in its ability to regulate rebellious and chaotic (inversion) qi. Tiānróng SI-17 shares with these points the ability to i. treat scrofula and goitre due to stagnation of qi and phlegm in the pivotal neck region, as well as throat disorders, ii. descend rebellious qi, in this case of the Lung and Stomach manifesting as fullness of the chest with difficulty in breathing, cough, asthma, wheezing and vomiting, and iii. treat disorders of the sense organs, in this case the ears (tinnitus and deafness). See Window of Heaven for a fuller discussion.

Summary of clinical application
Window of Heaven point: i. treats scrofula and goitre due to stagnation of qi and phlegm in the pivotal neck region, as well as throat disorders (painful obstruction, swelling and pain of the neck with inability to speak), ii. descends rebellious qi, in this case of the Lung and Stomach manifesting as fullness of the chest, difficulty in breathing, cough, chest pain, wheezing and vomiting, iii. treats disorders of the sense organs, in this case the ears (tinnitus and deafness).
