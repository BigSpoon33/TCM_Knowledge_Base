## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Géguān BL-46 (Diaphragm Gate) is level with Géshū BL-17 (Diaphragm Shu) the hui-meeting point of blood. Like Géshū BL-17, Géguān BL-46 has an important action on harmonising the diaphragm which lies between the upper and middle jiao and is able to resolve stagnation of qi in the upper jiao (fullness and oppression of the chest and diaphragm, sighing) and descend Stomach qi in the middle jiao (vomiting, difficult ingestion, belching).

Summary of clinical application
