## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas "The Spleen gathers the blood; when the Spleen is deficient it is unable to unite the blood", whilst the Treatise on Disorders of Blood states "When Spleen yang is deficient it is unable to gather the blood". Yǐnbài SP-1, the jing-well point of the Spleen channel, is one of the foremost acupuncture points for strengthening the Spleen's function of holding blood in its proper place. When this function is impaired there will be haemorrhage, usually chronic in nature, and occurring in any part of the body but most commonly in the lower jiao, whether as uterine bleeding or as bleeding into the urine or stools. In such cases moxibustion (either by moxa stick or direct cones) at Yǐnbài SP-1 is frequently employed, and it is particularly helpful to instruct the patient in the daily use of moxibustion at home. The action of Yǐnbài SP-1 on stopping bleeding, however, is not confined to cases of Spleen deficiency, but may also be applied where heat enters the blood level giving rise to reckless bleeding. This may manifest either in the lower or the upper part of the body (for example nosebleed or vomiting of blood). In these cases, needling or pricking to bleed is the usual method employed, although some physicians prefer to use moxibustion, despite the presence of heat.

The Essential Questions1 states "Dampness, swelling and fullness all pertain to the Spleen". Yǐnbài SP-1 is able to regulate the Spleen in the treatment of disorders such as abdominal distention, swelling of the limbs, diarrhoea etc., but as the jing-well and therefore most dynamic point of the Spleen channel, is principally indicated when these disorders are acute and of sudden onset.

According to the Classic of Difficulties2 jing-well points are indicated for "fullness below the Heart". Whilst the region 'below the Heart' specifically refers to the upper epigastrium, like many of the jing-well points Yǐnbài SP-1 treats fullness in the chest region as a whole. The Spleen primary channel ascends through the chest and lateral costal regions, connecting with points Rìyuè GB-24 Qímén LIV-14 and Zhōngfǔ LU-1, and terminates at Dàbāo SP-21 from where the great luo-connecting channel of the Spleen, like the Spleen sinew channel, spreads into the chest, ribs and lateral costal region. Yǐnbài SP-1, as the starting point of the channel, is especially effective at treating the opposite end of the channel and is indicated for a variety of disorders such as heat in the chest, fullness of the chest, dyspnoea and sighing.

The Spleen channel links with the Heart, reinforcing the close physiological relationship between the two zang. Yǐnbài SP-1, like many of the jing-well points, is indicated for disorders of the Heart and spirit, in this case agitation of the Heart, mania-depression and propensity to sadness. Like Lìduì ST-45, it is especially used for insomnia with excessive or restless dreaming and nightmares, and in clinical practice these two points may be combined for this purpose. Such is its action on the spirit that it was included by Sun Si-miao under its alternative name of Guilei (Ghost Fortress) among the 'thirteen ghost points' for the treatment of mania-depression and epilepsy.

Finally, Yǐnbài SP-1 shares with most of the other jing-well points the action of reviving and restoring the senses and is indicated for loss of consciousness.
