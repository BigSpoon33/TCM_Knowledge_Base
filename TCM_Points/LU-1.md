## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Zh≈çngf«î LU-1 is the front-mu point of the Lung. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body. Zh≈çngf«î LU-1, like all the front-mu points, therefore acts primarily on the Lung zang rather than the Lung channel.¬†
According to the Spiritual Pivot1 "The Lung is the canopy of the five zang and the six fu". As the uppermost zang, the Lung receives via respiration the clear qi of heaven (qing qi) in the same way that the canopy of a forest receives the light and air essential for life. Through inhalation, the Lung descends the qi to the Kidneys, and through exhalation, the Lung disseminates qi to the surface of the body and expels waste qi. The Lung is therefore said to dominate respiration and to both descend and disseminate the qi.¬†
These functions may be impaired either when the Lung qi is deficient, or when excess pathogenic factors (whether internally or externally generated) obstruct the Lung. The forte of Zh≈çngf«î LU-1 is to clear excess of all kinds from the Lung, whether due to exterior pathogenic factors (e.g. wind-cold or wind-heat) which penetrate to the Lung zang, or to internally generated disharmony (e.g. turbid phlegm or phlegm-heat, qi stagnation etc.). In all such cases there will be dyspnoea, coughing or wheezing and an oppressive full sensation of the chest, thus the Spiritual Pivot2 says "The Lung stores the qi ... when excess there is dyspnoea and fullness of the chest with an upturned face". These symptoms will often be exacerbated on lying down, which places more strain on the Lung descending function as well as allowing phlegm to accumulate, thus the Essential Questions3 says "The Lung is the canopy of the zang. When Lung qi is abundant, the mai [pulse] is large; when the mai is large, [the patient] is unable to lie flat".¬†
According to the Spiritual Pivot4 "Lung qi opens into the nose; when the Lung is in harmony, the nose will distinguish the fragrant from the foul". Zh≈çngf«î LU-1, although primarily used to regulate the Lung zang, is indicated when excess type Lung patterns are accompanied by such Lung channel disorders as nasal obstruction and throat painful obstruction.¬†
According to a saying of Chinese medicine "The Lung is the upper source of water". The Lung can be compared to a lid, for example the lid of a teapot. When the lid is too tight, the tea cannot pour, and when the Lung in the upper body is in excess, the fluids remain above and are not excreted below. Zh≈çngf«î LU-1 is indicated for acute swelling of the face which occurs when exterior pathogenic wind obstructs the Lung's function of regulating the water passages and descending body fluids.¬†
The Lung and the Stomach both dominate descending, and disharmony of one may affect the other. If Lung qi accumulates above, it may adversely influence the descending function of the Stomach, giving rise to difficult ingestion, vomiting, retching, and abdominal distention. Conversely, obstruction in the Stomach may impair the Lung descending function leading to cough, dyspnoea and wheezing. In Essential Questions5 Qi Bo, the Yellow Emperor's minister, explains that cough may originate in any of the zangfu and says "When cold food and drink enters the Stomach, it may rise upwards by way of the Lung channel to the Lung, leading to cold in the Lung". The name of this point 'Middle Palace' refers to the origin of the Lung channel, which arises in the middle jiao (in the region of the Stomach) and descends to the Large Intestine before ascending to emerge at Zh≈çngf«î LU-1. Zh≈çngf«î LU-1, therefore, is especially indicated in this dual disharmony of the Lung and Stomach. Interestingly, Zh≈çngf«î LU-1 is also indicated for Gall Bladder heat vomiting, perhaps reflecting the five phase theory that metal (the Lung) is able to control wood (Gall Bladder).¬†
According to the Essential Questions6 "The Lung dominates the skin ... of the entire body". The Spiritual Pivot7 states "when the pathogen is in the Lung there will be painful skin, chills and fever, rebellious qi, dyspnoea and sweating." Zh≈çngf«î LU-1 is one of the few acupuncture points indicated for the painful skin which can commonly accompany exterior diseases. Finally, the Essential Questions8 includes Zh≈çngf«î LU-1 among the eight points to clear heat from the chest (bilateral Quƒìp√©n ST-12, D√†zh√π BL-11, Zh≈çngf«î LU-1 and Fƒìngm√©n BL-12).
Summary of clinical application
Primarily used for excess pathogenic factors obstructing the Lung: cough, coughing of turbid phlegm, coughing blood and pus, dyspnoea, asthma, wheezing, fullness and oppression of the chest, chest pain.¬†
Also when such patterns are accompanied by congestion of the nose and throat or swelling of the face.¬†
Also when such patterns are accompanied by vomiting, retching and abdominal distention (the Lung channel originates in the middle jiao).¬†
As the front-mu point mainly treats the zang rather than the channel.
