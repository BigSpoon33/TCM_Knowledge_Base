## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

In the Essential Questions 37 the Yellow Emperor says "I have heard that wind is the beginning of the hundred diseases; what is the method of treating it by acupuncture"? His adviser Qi Bo replies "Wind enters from the exterior giving rise to shivering, sweating, headache, heaviness of the body and aversion to cold. Treat it by needling Fēngfǔ DU-16".

Wind, which may be of exterior or interior origin, is a yang pathogenic factor that therefore tends to affect the outer and upper (yang) portions of the body. Exterior wind predominantly injures the head and the superficial portion of the body, whilst interior wind stirs upwards and harasses the top of the body. The Governing vessel is known as the 'sea of the yang channels', and whilst many of its points are effective to eliminate both exterior and interior wind, Fēngfǔ DU-16 (Palace of Wind) is pre-eminent for this purpose. Its importance in the treatment of both kinds of wind disorder is emphasised in Investigation into Points Along the Channels by the Ming dynasty author Yan Zhen-shi, who said that Fēngfǔ DU-16 is indicated for "all types of wind disease".

When pathogenic wind invades the exterior portion of the body and impairs the ability of defensive qi to warm the skin, there will aversion to cold and shivering. If defensive qi is deficient and pathogenic wind attacks, the pattern known as disharmony of the nutritive qi and defensive qi may ensue, characterised by chills and shivering accompanied by sweating. The application of Fēngfǔ DU-16 in the treatment of this particular pattern of taiyang wind disorder is emphasised in the Treatise on Injury by Cold which says "In taiyang disorder, initially prescribe Gui Zhi Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction). If this causes agitation, needle Fēngchí GB-20 and Fēngfǔ DU-16 then (once again) represcribe Gui Zhi Tang. Recovery will follow". If pathogenic wind enters the channels and collaterals and penetrates the joints, there may be migratory aching and pain, known as 'wind painful obstruction'. In all such cases Fēngfǔ DU-16 is indicated.

Fēngfǔ DU-16 is of equal importance in the treatment of interior wind which derives from disharmony of the zangfu, particularly the Liver, and rushes upwards to the neck, head and brain. It is therefore indicated for headache, head wind, dizziness, blurred vision, upward staring eyes and windstroke. Not only is Fēngfǔ DU-16 able to descend pathogenic wind from the head in such cases, but it is also an important point to nourish the brain. According to the Spiritual Pivot 38 Fēngfǔ DU-16 is a point of the sea of marrow, "Its point above is the top of the head; below it is Fengfu" and "When the sea of marrow is in excess then there is lightness of the body and much strength and a person's self exceeds the normal level; when the sea of marrow is insufficient there is a whirling sensation of the brain, dizziness, tinnitus, pain of the lower legs, impairment of vision, indolence and desire to sleep". The wide-ranging effect of Fēngfǔ DU-16 on the head region is further emphasised both by the statement by Sun Si-miao in the Thousand Ducat Formulas that Fēngfǔ DU-16 treats 'the hundred diseases of the head', and by the alternative name Xingxing (Clear Headedness) given to this point in the classic Song to Keep Up Your Sleeve.

Due to the location of Fēngfǔ DU-16 in the neck region, the pivot of the head, as well as to its ability to eliminate wind and nourish the sea of marrow, Fēngfǔ DU-16 is an important point in the treatment of headache, head wind and neck disorders. The traditional term head wind has two principal meanings. Firstly it is used to refer to severe, long-standing and recurring headaches (for example migraine) that are recalcitrant to treatment, in contrast to a single incident of headache. Secondly, it describes a condition deriving from attack by exterior wind which invades the channels of the head and gives rise to headache, dizziness and deviation of the mouth and eye. Although primarily indicated for occipital (taiyang region) headache, as would be expected from its location, Fēngfǔ DU-16 is a meeting point of the Governing vessel with the Yang Linking vessel. This extraordinary vessel also links all the yang channels, and specifically connects with such important points for headache as Běnshén GB-13 through to Fēngchí GB-20 on the lateral side of the head, and Tóuwéi ST-8 on the forehead. Fēngfǔ DU-16 may therefore be needled in shaoyang (temporal) or yangming (frontal) region headaches when the primary pathogen is wind. As far as the neck is concerned, the ability of Fēngfǔ DU-16 to benefit this region is emphasised in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion which recounts how the great 2nd century physician Hua Tuo treated the Emperor Wu of the Three Kingdoms era for stiff neck. It is related that as soon as Hua Tuo needled Fēngfǔ DU-16, the Emperor was cured.

It is a reflection of yin-yang theory that when excess accumulates at the top of the body there is often a corresponding deficiency below, and this is borne out in the statement in the classic Song to Keep Up Your Sleeve "when the legs and feet are diseased choose Fēngfǔ DU-16". The ability of Fēngfǔ DU-16 to treat numbness of the legs reflects the principle stated in the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic 39 "When the disease is below select [points] from above".

Although the Heart is most frequently cited as the residence of the spirit, since its early beginnings Chinese medicine (particularly in the Daoist tradition) has been able to hold the concurrent belief that the head and brain also influence the spirit. Thus the Essential Questions 40 said "the head is the residence of the intelligence", Sun Si-miao in the Thousand Ducat Formulas said "The head is the supreme leader, the place where man's spirit concentrates" and Li Shi-zhen said "The brain is the residence of the original spirit". The Governing vessel enters the brain at Fēngfǔ DU-16, which is also said to mark its lower border, whilst another branch of the vessel passes through the Heart. Fēngfǔ DU-16 is therefore indicated for various mental disorders such as mania, incessant talking with inability to rest, mad walking and desire to commit suicide, as well as sadness and fear with fright palpitations. It was included under its alternative name of Guizhen (Ghost Pillow) by Sun Si-miao in his 'thirteen ghost points' for the treatment of mania disorder and epilepsy.

Finally, Fēngfǔ DU-16 is one of ten points listed in Chapter 2 of the Spiritual Pivot that have come to be known as Window of Heaven points. It shares with the other points of this group the ability to i. treat headache and dizziness, ii. descend rebellious qi (vomiting), iii. treat throat disorders, iv. benefit the sense organs (eyes, nose and tongue), and v. treat sudden onset of disorders (sudden inability to speak following windstroke, sudden loss of voice).
