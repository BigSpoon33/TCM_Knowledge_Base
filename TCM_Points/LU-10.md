## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Y√∫j√¨ LU-10 is the ying-spring and fire point of the Lung channel. According to the Classic of Difficulties22 ying-spring points are indicated for "heat in the body", and Y√∫j√¨ LU-10 is effective to clear heat from both the Lung channel and the Lung zang.

It is a general characteristic of the more distal points of the channels that they treat disorders of the upper end of the channel. The internal pathway of the Lung channel rises to the throat, and Y√∫j√¨ LU-10 is a major point for a wide range of throat disorders characterised by heat and dryness, whether due to deficiency or excess, and is indicated for pain, swelling, congestion and dryness of the throat and loss of voice.

Excess heat in the Lung zang may be subdivided into predominance of heat or predominance of phlegm. Y√∫j√¨ LU-10 is indicated in the former, whilst points such as Zh≈çngf«î LU-1 and Ch«êz√© LU-5 are preferable for the latter. If heat lodged in the Lung obstructs the descent of Lung qi, it will lead to coughing. If the fluids of the Lung are vaporised by heat, there will be sweating, whilst if Lung heat has scorched and consumed the fluids there will be coughing with absence of sweating. The extent of the sweating, therefore, indicates the severity of the heat. By virtue of its action on clearing heat, Y√∫j√¨ LU-10 is equally effective in clearing Lung heat deriving from deficiency of yin.

Y√∫j√¨ LU-10 is indicated for bleeding disorders affecting all three jiao. Lung heat may injure the vessels of the Lung causing coughing of blood, transmit to the origin of the Lung channel in the Stomach causing vomiting of blood, or transmit to the Heart and thence the Small Intestine and Bladder giving rise to blood in the urine (which may be accompanied by genital damp itching or impotence).

Y√∫j√¨ LU-10 is able to harmonise the relationship of the Lung and Heart on the one hand, and the Lung and Stomach on the other. According to the Warp and Woof of Warm Febrile Disease "The Lung and Heart are mutually connected, thus when there is Lung heat it most easily enters the Heart". If Lung heat agitates in the upper jiao therefore, it may transmit to the Heart causing agitation and mental disturbance such as anger and mania. Alternatively, if the gathering qi is deficient, then the qi of both the Lung and Heart will be deficient and unable to circulate the blood through the Heart with consequent stasis of Heart blood. Y√∫j√¨ LU-10 is indicated for diminished qi, shortness of breath and Heart painful obstruction.

The Lung channel originates in the middle jiao in the region of the Stomach. Y√∫j√¨ LU-10 is able to: i. clear heat which transmits to the Stomach channel giving rise to toothache, lacrimation or breast abscess, ii. counter dual rebellion of Lung and Stomach qi manifesting as cough with hiccup, and iii. treat various disorders of the Stomach fu including abdominal pain with inability to eat or drink, vomiting, childhood nutritional impairment and oesophageal constriction due to middle jiao deficiency.

Finally, Y√∫j√¨ LU-10 is an important local point in the treatment of pain and heat of the thumb joint.

Summary of clinical application
Clears heat from the Lung channel in the throat: throat painful obstruction, dry throat, loss of voice.
Clears excess or deficiency heat from the Lung: cough with absence of sweating, feverish body, coughing blood.
Clears Lung heat transmitted to the Heart: agitation, sadness, fright, anger and mania.
Clears Lung heat transmitted to the Stomach and Stomach channel: abdominal pain with inability to eat, vomiting, cough accompanied by hiccup, breast abscess, toothache.
