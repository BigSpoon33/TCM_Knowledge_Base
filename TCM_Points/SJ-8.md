## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The name Sanyangluo (Three Yang Luo) implies that this point is a meeting point of the three arm yang channels, in this respect mirroring Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 on the leg. From an examination of its indications, however, there seems little evidence to justify such a grand name. Sānyángluò SJ-8 does appear in various classical combinations for either sudden deafness or sudden loss of voice. Rarely used despite its name Sanyangluo (Three Yang Luo) which implies that this point is a meeting point of the three arm yang channels, in this respect mirroring Sānyīnjiāo SP-6 on the leg. Indicated for sudden deafness, sudden loss of voice, toothache, somnolence, fever, no desire to move the limbs, inability to move the arm, pain of the arm, lumbar pain due to traumatic injury.
