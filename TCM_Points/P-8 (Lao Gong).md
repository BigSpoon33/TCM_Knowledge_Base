## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Láogōng P-8 is the ying-spring and fire point of the Pericardium channel. According to the Classic of Difficulties13 ying-spring points are indicated for "heat in the body". Láogōng P-8 is a powerful point to revive consciousness and calm the spirit in cases where heat 'collapses' into the Pericardium during the course of febrile diseases, leading to disturbance of the emotions, and in severe cases coma.

There are two major discussions on the relationship of the Heart and the Pericardium channel in the Spiritual Pivot. At this early date, it is clear that the Pericardium channel was considered to be the main channel that linked with and treated the Heart itself, and indeed it was said that the Heart channel had no shu points of its own, Láogōng P-8 being listed as the ying-spring and fire point of the Heart channel. It is therefore not only used to clear febrile heat from the Pericardium, the 'wrapping of the heart', but is one of the principal points to clear Heart fire generated by internal disharmony. Heart fire may result from a number of different factors (see Dàlíng P-7), but due to the close relationship of the Pericardium and Liver jueyin channels, Láogōng P-8 is particularly indicated when stagnant Liver fire transmits to the Heart. If Heart fire agitates the spirit there will be various manifestations of psycho-emotional disharmony such as mania-depression, propensity to anger, ceaseless laughter and epilepsy. Like Dàlíng P-7, Láogōng P-8 is also able to bolster the spirit and is indicated for such manifestations of deficiency as fright, sadness and apprehension.

If Heart fire condenses body fluids it may generate phlegm, and when this is combined with wind stirred up by Liver yang, the resultant wind-phlegm may give rise to epilepsy or windstroke. The importance of Láogōng P-8 in the treatment of epilepsy and also mania-depression is reflected in its inclusion (under its alternative name of Guiku 'Ghost Cave') by Sun Si-miao in his 'thirteen ghost points' for the treatment of these conditions.

The Heart flowers into the tongue and the Spleen opens into the mouth. Mouth and tongue ulcers are differentiated into six main patterns: i. Heart fire, ii. Spleen and Stomach smouldering heat, iii. Kidney and Heart yin deficiency, iv. Spleen qi deficiency complicated with heat, v. blood deficiency with dry heat, and vi. Kidney yang deficiency. Láogōng P-8 is indicated for ulceration or erosion of the mouth and tongue from any of these patterns, especially when heat is involved.

The Pericardium primary and divergent channels pass through the diaphragm to the middle and lower jiao and the Pericardium channel is interiorly-exteriorly coupled with the Sanjiao channel. Like many points of the Pericardium channel, therefore, Láogōng P-8 also has a strong action on the middle jiao and is indicated in cases where fire disrupts the descent of Stomach qi resulting in foul breath, vomiting and difficult ingestion.

In common with Qūzé P-3, Dàlíng P-7 and Zhōngchōng P-9, Láogōng P-8 clears heat from the nutritive and blood levels. It may therefore be used when febrile heat at the blood level leads to reckless bleeding disorders such as vomiting blood, nosebleed, blood in the stool etc. Its ability to clear heat from the blood as well as its location, make it suitable for skin disorders affecting the palm such as eczema, tinea and scaling, as well as for heat and abnormal sweating of the palms. It is also indicated for hand painful obstruction and hand tremors.

In qigong practice, Láogōng P-8 can be thought of as mirroring Yǒngquǎn KID-1 on the soles of the feet. It is common practice to 'breathe through' either of these points, and focusing on and building the qi at Láogōng P-8 is a pre-requisite for emitting qi in the treatment of disease by qigong therapy.

Finally Láogōng P-8 is cited in the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc.
