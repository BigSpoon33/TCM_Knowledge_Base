## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Yan Zheng-shi of the Ming dynasty, in Investigation of Points Along the Channels, recommended H√†ny√†n GB-4 specifically for head wind with pain in the region of both T√†iy√°ng M-HN-9 points. Clinically, H√†ny√†n GB-4 should always be palpated in cases of one-sided headache, and needled if tender. Unusually for a point on the head, H√†ny√†n GB-4 is also indicated in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion for pain and stiffness of the wrist as well as 'joint wind' (i.e. painful obstruction) accompanied by sweating.

Summary of clinical application
For one-sided headache, especially with pain at bilateral T√†iy√°ng M-HN-9.
