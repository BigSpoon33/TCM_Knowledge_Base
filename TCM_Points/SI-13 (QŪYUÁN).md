## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion emphasises the use of Qūyuán SI-13 in the treatment of painful obstruction of the shoulder that has persisted and transformed into heat with contraction, pain and oppressive sensation. This transformation of wind, damp or cold into heat is a manifestation of the law of 'similar transformation' expounded by Liu Wan-su (see Yīnlíngquán SP-9).

Summary of clinical application
Both Qūyuán SI-13 and Jiānwàishū SI-14 are indicated for local disorders of the shoulder and scapula, with Jiānwàishū SI-14 additionally indicated for chills and fever accompanied by neck rigidity and inability to turn the head, and generalised painful obstruction.
