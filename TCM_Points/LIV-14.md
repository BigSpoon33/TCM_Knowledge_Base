## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Q√≠m√©n LIV-14 is the last point on the Liver channel and indeed the last point in the great circulation of qi which begins at Zh≈çngf«î LU-1 and passes through all the twelve channels, ending one complete cycle at this point. This is reflected in its name 'Cycle Gate'.

Q√≠m√©n LIV-14 is the front-mu point of the Liver. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body. It is in the region of this point that the Liver channel spreads through the lateral costal region, diaphragm and chest. Its main sphere of action therefore is on regulating the free flow of qi in these areas, and in contrast to ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13 which focuses on the middle and lower jiao, Q√≠m√©n LIV-14 acts primarily on the middle and upper jiao.

The Spiritual Pivot 18 states "With anger the qi rebels upwards and accumulates in the chest". If Liver qi is obstructed in the chest or lateral costal region, there will be pain, distention or fullness, whilst if Liver qi invades the Lung and obstructs its descending function, it will give rise to cough, sighing and dyspnoea. The Liver sinew channel links with the breast, and the entire breast region is strongly influenced by the Liver. If Liver qi is obstructed in the breast region, therefore, there will be pain, distention and even masses, all of which may fluctuate with the menstrual cycle, being most pronounced in the days immediately prior to menstruation. Q√≠m√©n LIV-14 is an important adjacent point in the treatment of this common condition.

The intimate relationship between qi and blood is clearly expressed in the saying "Qi is the commander of blood ... when qi moves, blood moves". Severe or prolonged qi stagnation, therefore, will lead to blood stasis manifesting as hardness or masses with cutting pain in the chest, lateral costal region, abdomen or hypogastrium. Q√≠m√©n LIV-14, by virtue of its ability to circulate both qi and blood, is indicated in all these situations. Q√≠m√©n LIV-14 is also specifically indicated for cutting or stabbing pain of the Heart, reflecting its status as a meeting point of the Liver channel with the Yin Linking vessel. According to the Classic of Difficulties 19 "When the Yin Linking vessel is diseased, Heart pain will result".

According to Zhang Jing-yue "If anger occurs during or after eating it injures the Stomach and Spleen" 17. This vital observation emphasises the great importance ascribed to a peaceful and harmonious state of mind during mealtimes. If instead there is disturbance, conflict, frustration, resentment or outright anger they may wreak turmoil in the digestive system. If Liver qi transversely invades the Stomach in this way and impairs its descending function, the Stomach qi will stagnate or rebel upwards leading to epigastric distention and pain, acid regurgitation, vomiting and hiccup. Q√≠m√©n LIV-14 is an essential local point in the treatment of this pattern of Liver-Stomach disharmony. If Liver qi transversely invades the Spleen and impairs the Spleen transportation and transformation function, there will be abdominal distention and diarrhoea, although Q√≠m√©n LIV-14 is less used clinically in this situation than ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13.

A specific indication for Q√≠m√©n LIV-14 is 'injury by cold leading to heat which enters the blood chamber'. This refers to attack and penetration of cold during menstruation or after childbirth. The cold transforms to heat and gives rise to alternating fever and chills, hardness and fullness in the lower abdomen, chest and lateral costal region, and clear consciousness during the day with disordered speech at night. This pattern was first described in the Treatise on Injury by Cold by Zhang Zhong-jing who recommended the administration of Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Minor Bupleurum Decoction) and needling Q√≠m√©n LIV-14, especially in the case of manic raving. The Tang dynasty author Xu Xue-shi, a scholar of the works of Zhang Zhong-jing, in his discussion of the Treatise on Injury by Cold said "Concerning heat entering the blood chamber in women, when Xiao Chai Hu Tang is too slow, needle Q√≠m√©n LIV-14". Q√≠m√©n LIV-14 is also indicated for uterine bleeding.

Finally, like ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13, Q√≠m√©n LIV-14 is an important point in the treatment of running piglet qi (see ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13 for a fuller discussion).
