## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

According the Classic of Difficulties28 "When the Penetrating vessel is diseased there is counterflow qi and abdominal urgency". Like many of the Kidney channel points on the abdomen, Y≈çum√©n KID-21 (the final point of the Penetrating vessel on the Kidney channel) is indicated for counterflow qi manifesting as nausea, vomiting, retching and cough. The term abdominal urgency refers to a sensation of acute cramping pain, usually associated with dysenteric disorder.

Like the majority of the Penetrating vessel points on the Kidney channel, Y≈çum√©n KID-21 is indicated for redness of the eyes originating at the inner canthus. Whilst there is no simple explanation of this symptom, it is worth noting that although some descriptions of the Penetrating vessel suggest that it terminate at the lips, illustrations and other accounts of its pathway usually show it ending at the inner portion of the eyes.

Summary of clinical application
The Classic of Difficulties says "When the Penetrating Vessel is diseased there is counterflow qi and abdominal urgency". This is the terminal point of the Penetrating Vessel on the Kidney channel.
Descends rebellious Lung and Stomach qi: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, vomiting of foamy (watery) saliva, nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, retching, fullness with no desire to eat, difficult ingestion, cough.
Treats disorders of the chest, lateral costal region and breasts.
