## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Zhìshì BL-52 is level with Shènshū BL-23, the back-shu point of the Kidneys. Despite its suggestive name 'Residence of the Will', there are no apparent references in any of the important classics of acupuncture to the use of this point for the treatment of emotional or psychological disorders.

Zhìshì BL-52 was also known as Jinggong (Palace of Essence), reflecting its ability to fortify the Kidney qi and yang, strengthen the sexual function and control discharge of semen, as evinced by its indications for impotence, premature ejaculation and seminal emission. It is similarly able to firm the Kidney qi and regulate urination, and is indicated for difficult or dribbling urination and oedema. Zhìshì BL-52 is also used clinically in the treatment of pain that spreads widely to the muscles of the lumbar region whether due to sprain, painful obstruction, or deficiency and disease of the Kidneys, for example renal colic. Unlike Shènshū BL-23, however, the application of Zhìshì BL-52 is confined to these patterns of Kidney deficiency and it lacks the wider ability of Shen-Shènshū BL-23 to deeply nourish and tonify the Kidneys.

According to the Essential Questions66 the five outer Bladder points level with the five zang back-shu points (i.e. Pòhù BL-42, Shéntáng BL-44, Húnmén BL-47, Yìshè BL-49 and Zhìshì BL-52) drain heat from the five zang, an action shared by the back-shu points of the five zang.

Summary of clinical application
Treats lumbar pain that spreads widely to the muscles of the lumbar region whether due to sprain, painful obstruction or deficiency and disease of the Kidneys, for example renal colic.
Strengthens the Kidneys: dribbling urination, difficult urination, oedema, impotence, premature ejaculation, seminal emission with dreams.
