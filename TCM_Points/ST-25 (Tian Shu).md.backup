## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The close relationship between the Stomach and intestines is emphasised in the Spiritual Pivot11 which states "the Small and Large Intestines both pertain to the Stomach". Furthermore, the Stomach is interiorly-exteriorly coupled with the Spleen which dominates transportation and transformation and plays an important role in regulating the intestines. Tiānshū ST-25 is the front-mu point of the Large Intestine, located on the Stomach channel, and is thus the point where the qi of the Large Intestine gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body.

Tiānshū ST-25, located on either side of the umbilicus, was said by the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries to dominate the middle region12, and its name 'Heaven's Pivot' or 'Celestial Pivot' refers to its central position between the upper and lower abdomen, the Stomach and the intestines. The Essential Questions states "[The area] above the celestial pivot is ruled by celestial qi; [the area] below the celestial pivot is ruled by the earthly qi. The place where these qi intersect is the origin of man's qi and the ten thousand things"13.

The two principal actions of Tiānshū ST-25 are i. treating intestinal disorders, and ii. regulating qi and eliminating stasis in the lower abdomen. Tiānshū ST-25 is the single most important point for the treatment of the widest variety of intestinal disorders. Due to its ability to regulate the Spleen and transform dampness, its forte is in the treatment of diarrhoea; indeed the Ode of the Jade Dragon states "The pattern of Spleen diarrhoea, look no further, needle bilateral Tiānshū ST-25". Diarrhoea and dysenteric disorder may be acute and due to accumulation of cold-damp, damp-heat or fire-poison, or may be chronic and due to deficiency of the Spleen and Kidneys or disharmony of the Liver and Spleen. Whatever the aetiology, Tiānshū ST-25 should form a pivotal role in the prescription, in combination with other suitable points selected according to differentiation. In modern practice Tiānshū ST-25 is much used in the treatment of bacillary dysentery and acute simple appendicitis in combination with such points as Shàngjùxū ST-37 and Qūchí L.I.-11. Although an important local point in the treatment of constipation, many authorities consider the more lateral Dàhéng SP-15 to be more effective.

The damp draining action of Tiānshū ST-25 is further evidenced by its indications for oedema, swelling of the face, drum distention and turbid painful urinary dysfunction.

Because of its central position between the upper and lower abdomen, the effect of Tiānshū ST-25 extends upwards to the Stomach. It is indicated for vomiting, retching and sudden turmoil disorder in which vomiting is accompanied by diarrhoea. Various classics also emphasise the ability of Tiānshū ST-25 to tonify deficiency, the Investigation Into Points Along the Channels recommending it for 'lower yuan (origin) deficient and cold' and the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries for 'deficiency damage'.

Tiānshū ST-25 also has an important action on regulating qi and eliminating stagnation in the lower abdomen. It is indicated for a wide range of problems including distention and pain of the abdomen, intestinal abscess, shan disorder, severe cutting periumbilical pain etc., as well as the treatment of menstrual disorders and abdominal or uterine masses due to stasis of either qi or blood.
