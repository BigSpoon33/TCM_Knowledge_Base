## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Yánggǔ SI-5 is the fire and jing-river point of the Small Intestine channel. Unlike the more distal points of the channel, it has relatively less action on the channel as a whole, in other words it is less used to treat disorders of the hand, arm or shoulder, but focuses rather on the eyes, ears and jaw. As a fire point it is able to clear heat and swelling and soothe contraction in these regions. It is specifically indicated for swelling of the neck and submandibular region, lockjaw, contraction of the tongue in babies, tongue thrusting (where the tongue is repeatedly thrust out of the mouth like a snake's tongue) and toothache. Whilst most classical sources recommend this point for toothache of the upper jaw, Sun Si-miao the famous 7th century physician incorporated it in prescriptions for toothache of both the upper and lower jaw.

As the fire point of the Small Intestine channel (interiorly-exteriorly related to the Heart channel) Yánggǔ SI-5 is able to clear fire from the Heart and calm the spirit and is indicated for mania and 'mad walking'.

Yánggǔ SI-5 is indicated (and appears in combination with distal points of the Bladder channel) for haemorrhoids.

Finally, in learning the names of the points of the yang channels at the wrist, it is helpful to remember the similarity between their names: Yángxī L.I.-5 (Yang Stream), Yánggǔ SI-5 (Yang Valley) and Yángchí SJ-4 (Yang Pool).
