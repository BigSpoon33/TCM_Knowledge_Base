## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Q≈´qu√°n LIV-8 is the he-sea and water point of the Liver channel. The he-sea points of the three leg yin channels, all water points, share the common property of draining dampness and damp-heat from the lower jiao. Yƒ´ng«î KID-10 predominantly clears damp-heat from the urogenital system (dominated by the Kidneys) whilst Yƒ´nl√≠ngqu√°n SP-9, by virtue of the intimate relationship between the Spleen and dampness, is able to treat all dampness disorders of the lower jiao. Because of the close relationship between the Liver channel and the genitals, Q≈´qu√°n LIV-8 primarily drains Liver damp-heat sinking down to this region.

Liver damp-heat may be due to i. the combination of Liver stagnant heat and Spleen dampness, ii.invasion of exterior damp-heat, or iii. excessive consumption of greasy food and alcohol. When damp-heat pours into the Liver channel it may give rise to genital itching, swelling and pain. If damp-heat agitates the 'gate of essence' there may be seminal emission. The Liver dominates the sinews, and according to the Essential Questions 16 "The genitals are the gathering place of the sinews". If damp-heat sinks to the genital region it can cause impotence due to flaccidity, in much the same way that damp-heat may cause atrophy disorder. Q≈´qu√°n LIV-8 is primarily indicated for these excess kinds of seminal emission and impotence, but in view of its secondary action of nourishing the Liver (see below), may be used in cases of deficiency, for example the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion recommends Q≈´qu√°n LIV-8 for seminal emission associated with sexual taxation.

The damp-heat draining action of Q≈´qu√°n LIV-8 extends to the Bladder (difficult urination or retention of urine), and the intestines (diarrhoea containing undigested food as well as diarrhoea containing blood and pus).

The Liver stores the blood which flows into the Conception and Penetrating vessels and thence the uterus to become menstrual blood, and its qi is responsible for the smooth flow of menstruation. When Liver qi stagnates, therefore, menstrual blood may also stagnate. Q≈´qu√°n LIV-8 is indicated in various classical sources for blood stasis in the uterus giving rise to infertility, abdominal masses and amenorrhoea. Clinically the combination of damp-heat and blood stasis is frequently encountered in gynaecological disorders, since stagnant blood may generate heat whilst the presence of damp-heat may obstruct blood. The action of Q≈´qu√°n LIV-8 on both these pathogenic factors renders it particularly suited to treating such dual disharmony. Uterine prolapse predominantly results from qi deficiency or damp-heat, and Q≈´qu√°n LIV-8 is particularly indicated for the latter.

As the water point of the Liver channel, Q≈´qu√°n LIV-8 links the Liver with its 'mother' the Kidneys. It therefore has a secondary function of both 'generating water to submerge wood' and nourishing the Liver yin and blood. It can be used to help subdue Liver yang in cases of headache and visual dizziness, and to nourish yin and blood in menstrual disorders. It should be said that the degree to which Q≈´qu√°n LIV-8 is considered an important point for nourishing the Liver varies considerably among different practitioners. An examination of its traditional indications and combinations, however, reveals that historically it has primarily been used for excess patterns. Finally Q≈´qu√°n LIV-8 is used for local disorders and is indicated for swelling, pain and coldness of the knee joint and surrounding area.

Summary of clinical application
Clears damp-heat from the genitals and lower jiao: swelling and itching of the genitals, pain of the genitals, pain of the penis, impotence, seminal emission, difficult urination or retention of urine, diarrhoea containing undigested food, diarrhoea containing blood and pus, uterine prolapse.
Dispels blood stasis from the uterus: infertility, abdominal masses, amenorrhoea.
Nourishes blood and yin: headache, dizziness.
