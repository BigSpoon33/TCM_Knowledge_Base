## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

As is often the case, a point such as Xìnhuì DU-22 which is considered of minimal importance in modern clinical practice, was clearly ascribed greater significance in classical texts, witnessed by the many traditional indications and combinations. It shares with many points of the head region the ability to pacify interior wind and treat various disorders of the head. Its application in nose disorders, however, is overshadowed by Shàngxīng DU-23, and in head wind, headache and dizziness, by Bǎihuì DU-20.

Summary of clinical application
Rarely used.
Indicated for nosebleed, nasal congestion, inability to distinguish the fragrant from the foul, excessive nasal discharge in children, pain of the nose, nasal polyps, head wind, chronic headache, deficiency and cold of the brain, bursting headache due to excessive consumption of alcohol, dizziness, visual dizziness, chronic and acute childhood fright wind, blue-green (qing) complexion, red and swollen face, swelling of the skin of the head, dandruff, somnolence, fright palpitations.
