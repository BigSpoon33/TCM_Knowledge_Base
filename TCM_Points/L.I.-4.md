## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Hégǔ L.I.-4 was included by Ma Dan-yang, the great physician of the Jin dynasty, among the 'eleven heavenly star points'6, his grouping of the most vital acupuncture points, and was indicated by him for headache, swelling of the face, malaria with chills and fever, tooth decay, nosebleed and lockjaw with inability to speak. The Ming dynasty author Gao Wu in his work Glorious Anthology of Acupuncture and Moxibustion also recognised the supreme importance of this point and included it among his 'four command points' (for the face and mouth). Some hundreds of years later it is still probably the best known and most commonly used of the acupuncture points.

Hégǔ L.I.-4 is a primary point to expel wind-cold or wind-heat and to release the exterior. It may be useful in this respect to view the yang Large Intestine channel as the exterior reflection of the yin Lung channel with which it is coupled. The Lung dominates the exterior by virtue of its function of controlling the skin and body hair and spreading the defensive qi. Attack by exterior pathogenic wind-cold or wind-heat which disrupts the exterior portion of the Lung system therefore, may be treated via points of the Large Intestine channel, most notably by Hégǔ L.I.-4. Thus the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion recommends this point for "injury by cold, headache, rigid spine, and absence of sweating". This is the classic presentation of wind-cold binding the exterior portion of the body. The basic principle in Chinese medicine for the treatment of this condition is to release the exterior by inducing sweating, thereby expelling the pathogen along with the sweat and facilitating the circulation of defensive qi. In fact, Hégǔ L.I.-4 may also be used for injury by any exterior pathogenic factor which is accompanied by sweating (in this case pathological sweating which does not serve to expel the pathogenic factor). This dual action of Hégǔ L.I.-4 on both inducing and stopping sweating is reflected by the advice given in the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion to reinforce Hégǔ L.I.-4 and reduce Fùliū KID-7 if there is no sweating, and to reduce Hégǔ L.I.-4 and reinforce Fùliū KID-7 in cases with copious sweating. The explanation of this apparently contradictory function is that Hégǔ L.I.-4 is able to regulate defensive qi and hence adjust the pores, whatever the pattern, indeed some authorities go so far as to attribute to Hégǔ L.I.-4 the ability to tonify the defensive qi.

The passage from the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion quoted above includes the symptom of 'great thirst', which is clearly not typical of exterior patterns (where the fever and thirst are still relatively mild). This does, however, reflect the common use of Hégǔ L.I.-4, especially in combination with Qūchí L.I.-11, to reduce high fever of whatever aetiology.

Hégǔ L.I.-4 is the single most important point to treat disorders of the face and sense organs. This has been emphasised in numerous classics, for example the Classic of the Jade Dragon states "Hégǔ L.I.-4 treats all diseases of the head, face, ears, eyes, nose, cheeks, mouth and teeth". This point is essential in the treatment of any disorder affecting these areas - whether acute or chronic, hot or cold, deficient or excess - but is least used clinically for disorders of the ears. As far as headaches are concerned, Hégǔ L.I.-4 is considered appropriate in the treatment of headache in any location due to attack by exterior pathogens, and most particularly any frontal (yangming channel) headache. In clinical practice, however, it is used even more widely, for example the Classic of the Jade Dragon recommended Hégǔ L.I.-4 for one-sided or generalised headache, whilst the Ode of the Jade Dragon more specifically recommended Hégǔ L.I.-4 for head wind without phlegm, and Fēngchí GB-20 for head wind with phlegm. The affinity of Hégǔ L.I.-4 for both the forehead and the side of the head reflects the fact that the internal pathway of the Large Intestine channel meets with the Gall Bladder channel at Yángbái GB-14, Xuánlú GB-5 and Xuánlí GB-6.

Hégǔ L.I.-4 is considered to have a particular ability to ease pain, especially in the areas discussed above, and is a commonly used point in acupuncture analgesia. According to Chinese medicine, pain of excess type arises when impaired circulation of qi and blood leads to stagnation. This is expressed in the saying "without movement there is pain, with movement there is no pain". The special ability of Hégǔ L.I.-4 to treat pain is explained by the statement in the Spiritual Pivot7 "Yangming channel is abundant in qi and blood". This emphasises the particular ability of points on the Large Intestine and Stomach (yangming) channels to promote circulation of qi and blood, and thus dispel obstruction and stop pain, for example in painful disorders such as painful obstruction. However the abundance of qi and blood in the arm and foot yangming channels means that their points are not only important to dispel stagnation, but also to tonify qi and blood in the channels and thus bring nourishment to the limbs in case of atrophy disorder and hemiplegia. In practice, Hégǔ L.I.-4 is commonly combined with Jiānyú L.I.-15 and Qūchí L.I.-11 in the 'chain and lock' point association method for pain, paralysis or atrophy of the upper limb.

Bilateral Hégǔ L.I.-4 and Tàichōng LIV-3 are known as the Four Gates. This combination first appeared in the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries which said "for cold and heat with painful obstruction, open the Four Gates". The text goes on to imply that the yuan-source points of the six yang channels emerge at the four gates. Since a fundamental principle for treating painful obstruction is to select points from yang channels, this helps to explain why these two points are considered so effective in treating painful obstruction. Subsequently, the use of the Four Gates has been extended to treat a variety of disorders involving pain and spasm. This is an elegant combination. Hégǔ L.I.-4 on the upper extremity lies in the wide valley between the first and second metacarpals, whilst Tàichōng LIV-3 on the lower extremity lies in the wide valley between the first and second metatarsals. Hégǔ L.I.-4, the yuan-source point, belongs to yangming channel which is 'abundant in qi and blood' whilst Tàichōng LIV-3, the shu-stream and yuan-source point of the Liver channel, has the function of spreading the qi. Together they are able to activate the qi and blood and ensure their free and smooth passage throughout the body.

Hégǔ L.I.-4 has a strong action on promoting labour. The Ode to Elucidate Mysteries tells how the Song dynasty Crown Prince, in a dispute with the doctor Xu Wen-bai over whether a pregnant woman was carrying a girl or twins, ordered her belly to be cut open to find out. Xu Wen-bai begged to use his needles instead, and on reducing Zúsānlǐ ST-36 and reinforcing Hégǔ L.I.-4 two babies emerged. Due to its strong action of inducing labour, and even promoting the expulsion of a dead foetus, Hégǔ L.I.-4 is contraindicated in pregnancy.

Finally Hégǔ L.I.-4 is cited in the Song of the Nine Needles for Returning the Yang, for the treatment of collapse of yang characterised by loss of consciousness, aversion to cold, cold counterflow of the limbs, purple lips etc.
