## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

As its name 'Welcome Fragrance' implies, Yíngxiāng L.I.-20 is the foremost local point for treating all disorders of the nose. As such it is the primary local point for treating the Chinese disease categories of 'bi yuan', 'bi qiu', nasal polyps and sores. Bi yuan (literally 'nose pool' but translated in this text as nasal congestion and discharge) more or less corresponds to sinusitis and encompasses symptoms such as thin or thick nasal discharge and blocked and stuffy nose, commonly accompanied by pain and loss of sense of smell and taste. Bi qiu (translated in this text as rhinitis) also includes allergic rhinitis and encompasses such symptoms as sneezing, nasal discharge and itching.

Yangming channel governs the facial area, and Yíngxiāng L.I.-20, a meeting point of the Large Intestine and Stomach channels, is able to expel wind and heat from the face as a whole. It is particularly indicated for swelling and itching of the face, as well as for pain and swelling of the lip, heat and redness of the eyes and deviation of the mouth.

In recent years this point, needled to join with Sìbái ST-2, has been much used to control the pain of biliary ascariasis. This disorder, which is endemic in China, is passed by eating contaminated raw vegetables fertilised by human 'night soil'. If the worms, which grow in the gall bladder, pass into the biliary duct, there is severe pain which is similar to that of cholelithiasis. The first step in treatment is to needle from Yíngxiāng L.I.-20 through to Sìbái ST-2 with strong manipulation. This is usually effective to control the pain within one or two minutes. Additional points on the body are used to consolidate the effect, whilst herbal medicine is used subsequently to eliminate the worms.

Summary of clinical application
Principal local point for all nose disorders: congestion and discharge, nosebleed, loss of sense of smell, nasal polyps, nasal sores, rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, sneezing.
Local point for pain, swelling, itching and paralysis of the face.
Joined to Sìbái ST-2 for treating pain of biliary ascariasis (worms in the bile duct).
