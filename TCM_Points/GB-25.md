## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Jīngmén GB-25 is the front-mu point of the Kidneys. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body.

The main action of Jīngmén GB-25 is to assist the mutual relationship between the Kidneys and the Spleen. According to the Complete Works of Jing-yue "Ming men is the sea of essence [and] blood, the Spleen is the sea of water and grain, together they are the root of the five zang and six fu". The Kidneys are the source of pre-heaven qi and rule the fluids, whilst the Spleen is the source of post-heaven qi, and rules the transportation and transformation of food and water. The Kidney yang is the root of all the yang of the body, and its fire is the source for the vigour of the Spleen's transportation and transformation function. At the same time, it is the Spleen which extracts the essence from food to supplement the Kidney essence. When this mutual support between the Kidneys and Spleen breaks down, there will be impairment of both the Spleen's digestive function, and the Kidneys' function of ruling the fluids. Jīngmén GB-25 is indicated for cases of cold or damp (dong) diarrhoea, borborygmus and abdominal distention resulting from Spleen yang deficiency which either derives from Kidney yang deficiency, or due to its prolonged nature has injured the Kidney yang. It is also used to tonify Kidney yang to facilitate the flow of water in urinary diseases and is indicated for difficult urination, concentrated urine, swelling of the face and 'failure of the water passages to flow'.

The Kidneys rule the lumbar region and the bones. The other principal application of Jīngmén GB-25 is in the treatment of disorders of the lumbar region and spine, particularly when due to deficiency of the Kidneys. It is therefore indicated for weakness of the spine and for lumbar pain with inability to stand for long. Due to its location on the Gall Bladder channel it is also indicated for combined pain of the back and lateral costal region, for example in renal colic, as well as for pain of the hip.
