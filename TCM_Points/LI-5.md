## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Yángxī L.I.-5 is the jing-river and fire point of the Large Intestine channel, and in common with the fire points of all the twelve channels, has a strong action on clearing heat. Thus whilst its area of action (nose, ears, eyes, teeth, head and throat etc.) is similar to that of Hégǔ L.I.-4, its action is primarily to clear heat and fire in these areas. When heat obstructs the nose there will be bleeding or rhinitis; when heat ascends to the ears there will be tinnitus, deafness and pain; when heat obscures the eyes there will be redness, swelling and pain of the eyes, superficial visual obstruction and lacrimation; when yangming channel heat inflames the teeth and gums there will be toothache, and when heat accumulates in the throat there will be swelling and congestion.

The Large Intestine and Stomach belong to yangming. Exuberant fire in yangming may easily transmit to the Heart and disrupt the spirit, whether in the form of the irritability and delirium that may occur during the course of a yangming stage fever, or in the form of the long-term Stomach fire or phlegm-fire seen in many serious emotional disorders. This important relationship is explained by the fact that although they are not linked by the primary channels, the Stomach divergent channel connects with the Heart, whilst the Stomach primary channel meets with the Governing vessel (and thus the brain) at Shéntíng DU-24 and Rénzhōng DU-26. Yángxī L.I.-5, the fire point of the hand yangming channel, is therefore indicated for febrile disease with agitation of the Heart, mania-depression, 'seeing ghosts', fright, manic raving and propensity to laughter. The last two indications may further reflect its status as a jing-river point which, according to the Spiritual Pivot8 should be needled when there are "diseases manifesting in the patient's voice".

Finally, Yángxī L.I.-5 is an important point in the treatment of wrist disorders, and like Wàngǔ SI-4, its corresponding point on the ulnar side of the wrist, is indicated for contraction of all the five fingers. In learning the names of the points of the yang channels at the wrist, it is helpful to remember the similarity between their names: Yángxī L.I.-5 (Yang Stream), Yánggǔ SI-5 (Yang Valley) and Yángchí SJ-4 (Yang Pool).
