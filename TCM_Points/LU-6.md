## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

K«íngzu√¨ LU-6 is the xi-cleft point of the Lung channel. The xi-cleft points are where the qi and blood, which flow relatively superficially along the channels from the jing-well points, gather and plunge more deeply. The xi-cleft points in general are indicated in the treatment of acute conditions and pain, whilst the xi-cleft points of the yin channels have an additional action of treating disorders of blood. K«íngzu√¨ LU-6 is an important point both for acute diseases of the Lung, and for disorders of blood.

K«íngzu√¨ LU-6 is particularly indicated for attack by exterior pathogenic wind-heat or wind-dryness which i. lodge in the superficial layer and obstruct the normal functioning of the pores, giving rise to febrile disease with absence of sweating, or ii. penetrate the Lung zang and channel giving rise to acute cough and wheezing, swelling and pain of the throat and loss of voice. In modern clinical practice, however, the principal use of this point is in the treatment of acute cough, wheezing or asthma of any aetiology.

As the Lung channel xi-cleft point, K«íngzu√¨ LU-6 is also particularly indicated for all kinds of bleeding from the Lung whether due to wind-dryness, wind-heat, phlegm-heat, Liver-Lung disharmony or yin deficiency.

Finally, K«íngzu√¨ LU-6 is indicated for obstruction of qi along the Lung channel with such symptoms as severe pain of the elbow and upper arm, difficulty in flexing and extending the fingers, and inability to raise the arm above the head.

Summary of clinical application
Xi-cleft point for acute Lung disorders: cough, wheezing, asthma, chest pain.
Xi-cleft point for attack of wind-heat or wind-dryness: swelling and pain of the throat, loss of voice, febrile disease with absence of sweating.
Xi-cleft point for bleeding disorders: coughing, spitting or vomiting blood.
Treats pain of the elbow, upper arm and fingers.
