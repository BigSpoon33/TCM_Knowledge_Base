## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The combination of Xuánjī REN-21 and Zúsānlǐ ST-36 has long been considered pre-eminent for treating accumulation of food in the Stomach. Whilst Xuánjī REN-21 shares with many points of the Conception vessel the ability to regulate the Stomach, it is interesting to note the statement in the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries, "Heaven, earth and man are the three powers. Bǎihuì DU-20 ... echoes heaven, Xuánjī REN-21 ... echoes man and Yǒngquǎn KID-1 ... echoes the earth". When this threefold division is applied to the body, heaven corresponds to the upper jiao which absorbs the heavenly qi, earth corresponds to the lower jiao and especially the Kidneys, whilst 'man', lying in-between heaven and earth, corresponds to the middle jiao and hence the Stomach.

The strong descending action of this point extends also to the Lung and it is indicated for rebellion of Lung qi giving rise to cough, wheezing and dyspnoea.

Traditionally indicated for accumulation of food in the Stomach, especially when combined with Zusanli ST-36.
Also pain and fullness of the chest and lateral costal region, cough, rebellious qi, wheezing, dyspnoea with inability to speak, rattling sound in the throat.
