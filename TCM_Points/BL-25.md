## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

D√†ch√°ngsh≈´ BL-25 is the back-shu point of the Large Intestine, where the qi of the Large Intestine emanates from the interior to the body surface. It is an important point to regulate the function of the Large Intestine fu, and its application is very broad.

When the Spleen is deficient or suffers from dampness, there may be loose stools, diarrhoea, undigested food in the stool, blood in the stools, borborygmus and inability to gain weight despite eating copiously. In combination with points that tonify the Spleen and Stomach, D√†ch√°ngsh≈´ BL-25 is an important point to firm and tonify the intestines. When there is stagnation (of qi, blood, damp-heat, toxic heat etc.) in the intestinal region, there will be distention, pain, cutting pain, fullness, constipation, intestinal abscess etc. In combination with other suitable points, D√†ch√°ngsh≈´ BL-25 is able to regulate qi and dissipate stagnation. When the central qi is deficient, or when damp-heat sinks downwards, there may be prolapse of the rectum. D√†ch√°ngsh≈´ BL-25 is a valuable adjacent point used in the treatment of this disorder, in combination with points such as B«éihu√¨ DU-20 and Ch√°ngqi√°ng DU-1, as well as points which treat the underlying disharmony.

Finally D√†ch√°ngsh≈´ BL-25 is an important local point in the treatment of lumbar pain, and like many points of the lower lumbar region is also indicated for painful obstruction and atrophy disorder of the lower limbs.

Summary of clinical application
Treats all disorders of the intestines: borborygmus, cold or damp diarrhoea, undigested food (in the stool), dysentric disorder, blood in the stool, intestinal abscess, difficulty in urination and defecation, constipation, prolapse of the rectum, distention and pain of the abdomen, distention, pain and fullness of the hypogastrium, twisting pain of the lower abdomen, cutting pain of the umbilical region, inability to eat and drink, remains thin despite much eating.
Treats the lumbar region and legs: lumbar pain, stiffness and rigidity of the lumbar spine, pain and painful obstruction of the lower limbs, atrophy disorder.
