## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The Sanjiao theory divides the body into three regions, the upper jiao (the area above the diaphragm), the middle jiao (the area between the diaphragm and the umbilicus) and the lower jiao (the area below the umbilicus). Zhīgōu SJ-6, the jing-river and fire point of the Sanjiao channel, is the most important point on the Sanjiao channel for moving qi and clearing heat in these three areas. According to the Song of the Primary Points of the Fourteen Channels Zhīgōu SJ-6 is able to "drain ministerial fire from the three jiao". Ministerial fire, the primal fire of the body which has its root in the ming men and Kidneys, is 'entrusted' to the Liver, Gall Bladder and Sanjiao. The quotation above emphasises the clinical importance of Zhīgōu SJ-6 in clearing heat throughout the body, and especially resolving stagnant heat of the Liver and Gall Bladder.

In the upper jiao Zhīgōu SJ-6 is able to clear heat from the Sanjiao channel, being indicated for febrile diseases, redness, pain and swelling of the eyes, tinnitus and deafness, lockjaw, swollen throat, scrofula etc. It is also able to resolve stagnation of qi in the chest giving rise to oppression of the chest and Heart pain. If stagnant qi transforms into fire and insults the Lung there may be cough with a red face.

In the middle jiao it is an essential point for treating pain of the lateral costal region, and distention due to qi stagnation or any other aetiology. According to the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries "For pain of the ribs and lateral costal region needle the Flying Tiger [Feihu, an alternative name for Zhīgōu SJ-6]" whilst the Song of the Jade Dragon says "When there is pain of the lateral costal region with obstruction and knotting, using Zhīgōu SJ-6 will give extraordinarily wonderful results". Zhīgōu SJ-6 is also indicated for vomiting and sudden turmoil disorder, and may be used in situations where there is distention and bloating in the upper and lower abdomen, often extending to the chest, with Heart pain, oppression of the chest or cough.

In the lower jiao Zhīgōu SJ-6 is a major point for moving the qi of the intestines and treating constipation, whether due to stagnation of qi, heat or any other aetiology. In fact Zhīgōu SJ-6 and Wàiguān SJ-5 are the only points on the three arm yang channels indicated for constipation, and of these two Zhīgōu SJ-6 has always been considered the pre-eminent. According to the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion Zhīgōu SJ-6 is also indicated for blockage of the Conception vessel in women, a further reflection of its ability to move stagnation.

According to the Spiritual Pivot 8 the jing-river points should be needled when there are "diseases manifesting in the patient's voice", and Zhīgōu SJ-6 is an important point (and included in a number of classical combinations) for sudden loss of voice.

Finally, Zhīgōu SJ-6 is indicated for various channel disorders affecting the whole upper limb, axilla, shoulder and back, including tremors, trembling and numbness of the hand. In current practice it is often combined with Xuánzhōng GB-39 in the treatment of wandering painful obstruction.
