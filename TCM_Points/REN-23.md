## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Li√°nqu√°n REN-23, a meeting point of the Conception vessel with the Yin Linking vessel and located at the root of the tongue, is much used clinically in the treatment of loss of voice and stiffness of the tongue following windstroke. Li√°nqu√°n REN-23 may also be used to regulate the production of fluids in the mouth, either in the case of excess spittle or for dryness of the mouth and thirst.
