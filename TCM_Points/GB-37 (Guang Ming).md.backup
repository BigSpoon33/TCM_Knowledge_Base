## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The Guide to the Classics of Acupuncture states "the luo-connecting points are located between two channels ... if they are punctured, symptoms of the interiorly-exteriorly related channels can be treated"15. The Liver 'opens' into the eyes, and the Liver, Gall Bladder, and Gall Bladder divergent channels connect with the eye. Many eye diseases derive from Liver pathology, and as its name 'Bright Light' suggests, Guāngmíng GB-37, the luo-connecting point of the Gall Bladder channel, is the principal distal point on the channel for the treatment of a wide range of eye disorders, including pain, redness, itching, long and short sightedness and night blindness.

Its second function of activating the channel and alleviating pain is important in two ways. Firstly, by dispelling wind-damp and regulating the circulation of qi in the lower limb, it is effective in treating a wide range of disorders of the lower leg including knee pain, pain of the lower legs with inability to stand for long, atrophy disorder and painful obstruction of lower limb with numbness and heat, and pain of the lower leg. Secondly, the Gall Bladder primary channel passes through the chest whilst its sinew channel links with the breast, and Guāngmíng GB-37 is indicated for distention and pain of the breast due to stagnation of Liver qi.

Finally the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion gives specific indications for excess and deficiency of the luo-connecting points. In the case of Guāngmíng GB-37, these are heat sensation of the lower leg, knee pain, numbness of the body and propensity to grind the teeth (excess); atrophy disorder of the legs with difficulty in standing after sitting (deficiency).

Summary of clinical application
For a wide range of eye disorders, including pain, redness, itching, long and short sightedness and night blindness.
For disorders of the lower leg: knee pain, pain of the lower legs with inability to stand for long, atrophy disorder, painful obstruction of lower limb with numbness and heat.
