## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40 is the single most important acupuncture point to transform phlegm in the body, whatever its origin. Phlegm may be formed when i. stagnation of Liver qi impairs the circulation of fluids which then congeal into phlegm, ii. excess or deficiency heat condense body fluids (phlegm is known as the 'substantial part of fire', and fire the 'non-substantial part of phlegm') or iii. any or all of the three zang responsible for fluid transformation and transportation are deficient (the Lung in the upper jiao, the Spleen in the middle jiao and the Kidneys in the lower jiao). Of all these, disharmony of the transportation and transformation function of the Spleen is clinically the most important, thus the Essential Questions39 says "The Spleen is the origin of phlegm" and "When water, grain and body fluids do not flow, they will accumulate and form phlegm-fluid (tanyin)". When the Spleen transportation and transformation function is impaired, therefore, body fluids collect and over time transform to phlegm, which may then transmit to other zangfu and regions of the body. Furthermore, it is a general treatment principle that the Spleen should be regulated in the treatment of phlegm of any aetiology, to assist in its transformation. Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40 is the point from which the Stomach luo-connecting channel connects with its associated Spleen channel. The Guide to the Classics of Acupuncture states "the luo-connecting points are located between two channels ... if they are punctured, symptoms of the interiorly-exteriorly related channels can be treated"40. Traditionally, Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40 has been used to treat any accumulation of phlegm, especially affecting the Lung, Heart, throat and head.

According to a saying of Chinese medicine, "The Spleen is the origin of phlegm and the Lung is the container of phlegm". When phlegm obstructs the descent of Lung qi, or when Lung qi deficiency is unable to descend the fluids, there may be coughing, wheezing and asthma characterised by copious expectoration of phlegm. When cold predominates, the phlegm will be clear or white, whilst when heat predominates, the phlegm will be yellow, green or brown. Whether cold or hot, Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40 is an essential point to transform phlegm in the Lung.

Both the primary and sinew channels of the Stomach pass through the chest, and Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40 has long been considered a pre-eminent point in the treatment of chest pain. If phlegm obstructs the free movement of qi and blood in the chest there may be fullness, oppression and stabbing pain. Such is its affinity for the chest, however, that Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40 may be used in the treatment of any kind of chest pain including sprain and injury of the chest muscles.

The pattern of phlegm or phlegm-fire misting or deranging the Heart and spirit principally occurs when severe emotional depression leads to stagnation of qi. Stagnant qi can no longer distribute body fluids, which coagulate to form phlegm. Phlegm then obstructs the portals of the Heart, disrupting the spirit. Pronounced or prolonged stagnation of qi and phlegm may transform into fire resulting in phlegm-fire, which may be further complicated by over-consumption of greasy and spicy food and alcohol. When the fire aspect of phlegm-fire is intense, the patient suffers from 'kuang', or mania disorder, with such symptoms as mad laughter and wild and intense behaviour. When the phlegm aspect predominates, with relatively less fire, the patient suffers from 'dian', characterised by mental confusion, lethargy and stupor. The ability of Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40 to transform phlegm, combined with the fact that the Stomach divergent channel connects with the Heart, and the Stomach primary channel with the Governing vessel (and thus the brain) at Sh√©nt√≠ng DU-24 and R√©nzh≈çng DU-26, renders it particularly suitable in treating these disorders.

The Stomach luo-connecting channel from Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40 joins with all the yang channels in the head region. If phlegm-damp obstructs the upper jiao and the head, it may impair the ascent of clear yang to the head and sensory orifices, giving rise to dizziness and headache characterised by a heavy and clouded sensation. If interior wind rushes upwards, carrying phlegm with it, this is known as wind-phlegm and may give rise to such symptoms as epilepsy and severe dizziness. The Stomach luo-connecting channel terminates at the throat, and if stagnant qi impairs the ability of the Lung and Stomach to descend the fluids, phlegm is formed and combines with stagnant qi to obstruct the throat, giving rise to plumstone qi (globus hystericus) a sensation of throat blockage which worsens or ameliorates according to fluctuations in the emotional state and which is normally associated with stagnation of qi and phlegm.

A great variety of disorders affecting any region of the body may be caused by phlegm. This is expressed in the Chinese medicine sayings "There is no place that phlegm cannot reach", "The hundred diseases all pertain to phlegm", "Strange diseases often involve phlegm", and "Chronic disease often involves phlegm". Whatever the manifestations, if phlegm is a component of the pathology, Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40 is indicated.

Like many points of the foot yangming Stomach channel which is abundant in qi and blood, Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40 is indicated for channel disorders such as atrophy disorder and painful obstruction of the lower leg. Due to its ability to transform phlegm, Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40 is especially indicated in the treatment of hemiplegia due to wind-phlegm in the channels.

Finally the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion gives specific indications for excess and deficiency of the luo-connecting points. In the case of Fƒìngl√≥ng ST-40, these are mania-depression (excess); lack of control of the legs and withering of the lower legs (deficiency).
