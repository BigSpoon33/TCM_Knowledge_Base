## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

In Chapter 21 of the Spiritual Pivot F√∫t√∫ L.I.-18 is included in a list of five points known as 'Window of Heaven' (literally 'five regions of the Window of Heaven') points. This passage states "Sudden loss of voice with obstructed qi in the throat, choose F√∫t√∫ L.I.-18 and bleed the root of the tongue". F√∫t√∫ L.I.-18 shares certain important characteristics of this grouping in that it treats goitre and scrofula due to stagnation of qi and phlegm in the pivotal neck region, and sudden loss of voice, coughing and wheezing due to inversion qi. See 'Window of Heaven' for a fuller discussion of these points.

In clinical practice, F√∫t√∫ L.I.-18 is frequently used as an alternative to (or in combination with) R√©ny√≠ng ST-9, in the treatment of difficulty in swallowing (especially following windstroke) and chronic disorders of the vocal cords.

Summary of clinical application
Local point for disorders of the throat region: swelling and pain, sudden loss of voice, rattling sound, difficulty in swallowing.
Window of Heaven point hence treats the throat region (scrofula and goitre), sudden onset of symptoms (sudden loss of voice) and rebellion of qi manifesting as coughing and wheezing.
