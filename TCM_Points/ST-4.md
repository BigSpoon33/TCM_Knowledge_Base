## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The 12th century classic Secret Writings of Bian Que states "use Dìcāng ST-4 in all cases where treacherous wind enters the ear, mouth and eye and leads to deviation". Dìcāng ST-4 is an important local point to eliminate wind from the face and is frequently used in the treatment of facial paralysis, whether due to exterior pathogenic wind or the sequelae of windstroke, particularly when the mouth is affected with symptoms such as drooling and deviation. Dìcāng ST-4 is also important in the treatment of facial pain such as trigeminal neuralgia. Pain of the face is usually differentiated into: i. invasion of the channels of the face by wind and cold, ii. flaring up of Stomach and Liver fire, and iii. heat due to yin deficiency. Due to its location, Dìcāng ST-4 may be needled whatever the pattern.

For both these applications, Dìcāng ST-4 is commonly joined to points such as Jiáchē ST-6, Quánliáo SI-18, Yíngxiāng L.I.-20 and Chéngjiāng REN-24 by transverse needling. The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion recommends needling left Dìcāng ST-4 for diseases of the right side of the face, and vice-versa. This principle of contralateral needling is discussed in the Spiritual Pivot2 which states "Contralateral insertion, that is, if the left is affected, the right is treated, and if the right affected, the left is needled", and the Essential Questions3 which says "When evils invade the channels, if the left side is in excess, the disease occurs on the right side, and vice versa ... for these conditions, contralateral insertion should be used". Although common practice emphasises needling the diseased side, these statements underline the important principle of treating the healthy side, where the qi is plentiful, in chronic cases and those involving great deficiency.

It is interesting to note the use of Dìcāng ST-4 for leg disorders, reflecting the principle stated in the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic4 "When the disease is below select [points] from above". Whilst the use of points on the lower body to treat diseases of the upper body is extremely common, the reverse is relatively rare. Other examples are Bǎihuì DU-20 for anal disorders, Rénzhōng DU-26 and Rényíng ST-9 for lumbar pain, and Shuàigǔ GB-8 for vomiting.

Summary of clinical application
Important local point for interior or exterior wind giving rise to: deviation of the mouth, face pain, trigeminal neuralgia, numbness of the lips and face, contraction of the facial muscles, inability to close the eye and twitching of the eyelids.
For facial paralysis and trigeminal neuralgia, frequently joined to points such as Jiáchē ST-6, Quánliáo SI-18 and Yíngxiāng L.I.-20 by transverse needling.
“Use Dìcāng ST-4 in all cases where treacherous wind enters the ear, mouth and eye and leads to deviation” (Secret Writings of Bian Que).
