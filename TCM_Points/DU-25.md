## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

In recent times this point has been found to be effective in reducing alcohol intoxication by redirecting the route of elimination from the liver to the lung and thereby increasing the volume of alcohol present in the expired air. Other recent research has shown this point to be more effective than Rénzhōng DU-26 in restoring loss of consciousness.
