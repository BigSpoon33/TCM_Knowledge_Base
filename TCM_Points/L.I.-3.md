## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

In common with many of the distal points of the Large Intestine channel, Sānjiān L.I.-3 expels wind-heat and yangming channel heat from the upper reaches of the channel, being indicated for symptoms such as pain and swelling of the throat, dry scorched lips and mouth, chills and fever and nosebleed. As far as toothache and pain from tooth decay is concerned, Zhu Dan-xi of the Jin-Yuan dynasty recommended applying moxibustion to Sānjiān L.I.-3 for toothache of the lower jaw (and to Shǒusānlǐ L.I.-10 for toothache of the upper jaw4), whilst in modern clinical practice, some Chinese practitioners favour Sānjiān L.I.-3 over Hégǔ L.I.-4 for the treatment of severe or recalcitrant toothache.

It is a characteristic of the three yang channels of the hand (Large and Small Intestines and Sanjiao) that relatively few of their points are indicated for disorders of their corresponding fu, for example points of the Small Intestine channel are notable for the absence of indications of intestinal disorders. By contrast, the lower he-sea points which are ascribed to these three channels on the lower limb (Shàngjùxū ST-37 for the Large Intestine, Xiàjùxū ST-39 for the Small Intestine and Wěiyáng BL-39 for the Sanjiao) are much used clinically for disorders of the fu. In the case of the Large Intestine channel however, several points including Sānjiān L.I.-3 are classically indicated for borborygmus and diarrhoea. Nevertheless, points of the Large Intestine channel are little used for this purpose in clinical practice, and they appear in relatively few classical combinations for the treatment of intestinal disorders.

According to the Classic of Difficulties5 the shu-stream points are indicated for "heaviness of the body and pain of the joints". Sānjiān L.I.-3 is an important local point for treating disorders of the fingers (especially the index and middle fingers) and dorsum of the hand. It is often combined with Hòuxī SI-3 in the treatment of stiffness, swelling and pain of the five fingers, and like Hòuxī SI-3, whose location it mirrors, is also indicated (although less used clinically) for acute stiff neck.

Finally, like Èrjiān L.I.-2, Sānjiān L.I.-3 is indicated for such symptoms as somnolence and fright.
