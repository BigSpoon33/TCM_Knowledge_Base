## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Zútōnggǔ BL-66 is the water point of the Bladder water channel. Like all the distal points of the Bladder channel, its principal action is to clear pathologically ascending qi and yang from the head. This was emphasised in the Spiritual Pivot75 which stated "When [chaotic] qi is in the head, select Tiānzhù BL-10 and Dàzhù BL-11. If needling these fails to work, select the spring and stream points of the foot taiyang" (i.e. Shùgǔ BL-65 and Zútōnggǔ BL-66).

If chaotic qi affects not only the head, but also impairs the descending function of the Lungs and Stomach, the consequent rebellion of qi will give rise to coughing, dyspnoea, fullness of the chest and vomiting.

Summary of clinical application
Clears the head: heaviness of the head, neck pain, visual dizziness, redness of the eyes, nosebleed.
Descends Lung and Stomach qi: coughing, dyspnoea, fullness of the chest, vomiting.
