## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 is the shu-stream and yuan-source point of the Liver channel. The Spiritual Pivot in Chapter 6 recommends the use of the shu-stream points in disorders of the zang, whilst in Chapter 1 it says "When the five zang are diseased, select [from] the twelve yuan-source [points]". T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 is arguably the most important point of the Liver channel, with an extensive range of actions, and may be used with equal effect for both excess and deficiency patterns of the Liver zang and its channel. So important did the Ming dynasty physician Xu Feng consider T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 to be, that he added it to Ma Danyang's 'eleven heavenly star points' when listing them in his work Complete Collection of Acupuncture and Moxibustion. Since this time, these points have become known as Ma Danyang's 'twelve heavenly star points'.

Master Zhu Dan-xi in the 14th century said "The Liver governs spreading and draining" and "When the qi and blood flow harmoniously, the ten thousand diseases will not arise. Once there is constraint, all diseases may arise". The Liver's function of spreading means that although the Liver is not considered responsible for the production of qi, it ensures that the flow of qi in the body remains free, easy, open, relaxed and unobstructed. This function may be impaired in three main ways. Firstly, and most commonly, it may develop when the spontaneous expression of any of the emotions is restricted, especially anger. Secondly, the spreading function of the Liver is an expression of its yang qi, and a saying of Chinese medicine stresses "The body of the Liver is yin whilst its function is yang". In other words, the Liver yang is dependent on Liver yin. Stagnation of Liver qi may therefore result from failure of yin or blood to moisten, nourish and soften the Liver. Thirdly, the ability of the Liver to spread qi may be obstructed by the presence of pathogenic damp-heat. A full understanding of Liver disharmony also stresses one further point which is that Liver qi stagnation may bring about the development of any other Liver pattern, for example by transformation into Liver fire, the consequent consumption of yin and hence the uprising of Liver yang, or by transformation of either Liver fire or Liver yang into wind. For this reason it is said that clinically any pattern of disharmony of the Liver may be accompanied by qi stagnation.

When Liver qi stagnates it gives rise to sensations of pressure, distention and pain, predominantly in those areas traversed by the Liver channel and its interiorly-exteriorly coupled Gall Bladder channel. Qi stagnation tends to move around and fluctuate, mainly according to emotional changes, and is relieved by emotional expressiveness and physical activity, both of which free the flow of qi. The name of T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 'Great Rushing' refers to this point's function as the great passageway for the flow of qi in the channel. It is a primary point for promoting the free-flow of Liver qi, and can resolve Liver qi stagnation giving rise to distention and pain in any part of the body, whether the head, eyes, throat, chest, Heart, breasts, epigastrium, abdomen, lateral costal region, uterus or genitals.

According to the Spiritual Pivot 10 "The Liver stores blood, the blood is the residence of the ethereal soul (hun); when Liver qi is deficient there is fear". Although much used in modern clinical practice for emotional and psychological manifestations of qi stagnation such as depression, frustration, pent-up feelings, irritability, premenstrual tension, mood swings, weepiness etc., it is striking that with the exception of fearfulness, psycho-emotional indications are almost entirely absent from major classical sources.

T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 is an essential point for subduing Liver yang and pacifying Liver wind. The Liver is the zang of wood and wind and is entrusted with the ministerial fire. Its qi is vigorous, forceful and active, and according to sayings of Chinese medicine "The Liver governs uprising" and "The Liver dominates physical movement". It is common, therefore, for the hot, aggressive, ascending, and moving nature of the Liver to exceed normal limits and manifest as upsurging of Liver yang, or progress to the stirring up of Liver wind. Alternatively wind may stir due to deficient blood and consequent emptiness of the blood vessels. Typical manifestations of wind for which T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 is indicated include headache, dizziness, numbness of the head, childhood fright wind, tetany, epilepsy, opisthotonos and deviation of the mouth.

T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 is equally important for all deficiency patterns of the Liver. It promotes the generation of both Liver blood and Liver yin and hence nourishes those areas of the body dominated by the Liver, namely the eyes, sinews and uterus. Liver yin deficiency is the root of hyperactivity of Liver yang, whilst Liver blood or yin deficiency frequently lie at the root of Liver wind. T√†ich≈çng LIV-3, therefore, is able both to subdue excess and nourish deficiency, and thus treat both the root and manifestation of these patterns.

The Spiritual Pivot 11 says "Liver qi opens into the eyes, when the Liver is in harmony the eyes are able to distinguish the five colours" whilst the Essential Questions 12 states "When the Liver receives blood it gives rise to vision". T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 is indicated for failure of the Liver blood or yin to nourish the eyes resulting in blurred or failing vision, as well as for excess disharmonies where Liver fire, Liver yang, or Liver channel wind-heat result in red, swollen, and painful eyes, or where Liver wind leads to unusual movement of the eyes or eyelids.

The Liver channel connects with the brain at B«éihu√¨ DU-20, the topmost point of the body, and is the only yin channel to ascend directly to the upper part of the head. T√†ich≈çng LIV-3, therefore, is used to treat many disorders of the head, especially headache and dizziness, due to both excess and deficiency patterns of the Liver. It is specifically indicated for vertex headaches, although it is worth noting that neither headache nor dizziness are found as indications for this point in any major classic.

The Liver is closely related to the menstrual cycle. The Liver stores the blood and its channel enters the lower abdomen and connects with the Conception vessel at Q≈´g«î REN-2, Zh≈çngj√≠ REN-3 and GuƒÅnyu√°n REN-4, whilst it is the free movement of Liver qi prior to menstruation which ensures the smooth flow of blood. So important is the Liver to menstruation that Ye Tian-shi stated "the Liver is the pre-heaven qi of women". Liver qi stagnation, Liver fire or deficiency of Liver blood may therefore give rise to such disorders as amenorrhoea, irregular menstruation and incessant uterine bleeding. T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 is an important point in the treatment of any of these disorders.

The Liver channel passes through the genitals and lower abdomen, and is closely related to the genito-urinary organs. Normal excretion of urine depends mainly on the Kidneys and Bladder but is also assisted by the Liver's spreading function. T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 is indicated for retention of urine, painful urinary dysfunction or difficult urination characterised by qi stagnation, as well as for shan disorder, pain of the genitals and swelling or retraction of the testicles. Due to its general affinity for this area, however, T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 is also indicated for deficiency urinary patterns such as enuresis, incontinence and deficiency-taxation oedema. In fact there are other indications of the ability of T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 to tonify deficiency in this region, for example insufficiency of essence (semen) in men and seminal emission.

In the intestinal region, failure of the qi to flow freely may lead to binding of the stools, and T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 may be used for constipation or difficult defecation due to qi stagnation or stagnant heat. When Liver qi stagnation co-exists with Spleen deficiency, the commonly-seen clinical pattern of abdominal pain and diarrhoea with thin stools, alternating with difficult defecation or constipation, may be encountered. T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 is an important point for the treatment of this pattern, and may be combined for example with ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13, the front-mu point of the Spleen. In the middle jiao, T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 is indicated for vomiting due to Liver-Stomach disharmony and jaundice due to Liver and Gall Bladder damp-heat.

Bilateral T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 and H√©g«î L.I.-4 are known as 'the four gates'. This combination first appeared in the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries which said "for cold and heat with painful obstruction, open the four gates". The text goes on to imply that the yuan-source points of the six yang channels emerge at the four gates. Since a fundamental principle for treating painful obstruction is to select points from yang channels, this helps to explain why these two points are considered so effective in treating painful obstruction. Subsequently, the use of these points has been extended to treat a variety of disorders involving pain and spasm. This is an elegant combination. H√©g«î L.I.-4 on the upper extremity lies in the wide valley between the first and second metacarpals, whilst T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 on the lower extremity lies in the wide valley between the first and second metatarsals. H√©g«î L.I.-4, the yuan-source point, belongs to yangming channel which is 'abundant in qi and blood' whilst T√†ich≈çng LIV-3, the shu-stream and yuan-source point of the Liver channel, has the function of spreading the qi. Together they are able to vigorously activate the qi and blood and ensure their free and smooth passage throughout the body. Finally T√†ich≈çng LIV-3 is indicated for a variety of channel disorders such as lumbar pain, pain or weakness of the knee and leg, coldness of the knees and feet and contraction of the five fingers.
