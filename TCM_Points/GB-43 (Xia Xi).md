## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the Classic of Difficulties22 ying-spring points are indicated for 'heat in the body'. The Gall Bladder channel traverses the sides of the head, enters the ear and connects with the eye. Xiáxī GB-43, the ying-spring point of the Gall Bladder channel, is indicated for Liver and Gall Bladder heat which ascends along the channel to the head and gives rise to such symptoms as headache, dizziness, deafness, tinnitus, ear pain, redness and pain of the outer canthus and itching of the eyes. It is interesting to note, however, that although much used for one-sided head-ache in modern-day clinical practice, headache is not mentioned as an indication for this point in any of the major classical texts, although Xiáxī GB-43 does appear in point combinations for head wind.

Both the Gall Bladder fu and the Gall Bladder channel are prone to suffer from damp-heat. It is a general principle of the channels, most clearly seen on the leg yang channels, that the points close to the knee (especially the he-sea points) treat the internal fu, and the more distal points (especially the jing-well and ying-spring points) treat disorders of the channel. Whilst not applicable for damp-heat distressing the Gall Bladder fu, therefore, Xiáxī GB-43 as befits its distal location is an important point for damp-heat (usually in combination with qi stagnation) which congests the channel giving rise to swelling in various regions of the body. In the upper body it is indicated for swelling of the cheek or submandibular region. In the chest it is able to treat pain of the chest and lateral costal region, breast abscess and discharging breast abscess (reflecting both the pathway of the Gall Bladder sinew channel to the breasts and the close relationship between the Gall Bladder's coupled Liver channel and the breasts). In the lower body it may be used for dampness and heat which sink downwards and give rise to swelling of the knee, toes or dorsum of the foot, and damp erosion and cracking between the toes.

Summary of clinical application
Clears Gall Bladder fire from the head: headache, dizziness, deafness, tinnitus, ear pain, redness and pain of the outer canthus, itching of the eyes.
Clears damp-heat from the Gall Bladder channel: swelling of the cheek or submandibular region, pain of the chest and lateral costal region, breast abscess, discharging breast abscess, swelling of the knee, toes or dorsum of the foot, damp erosion and cracking between the toes.
