## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Sh√©nm√©n HE-7 is the shu-stream and yuan-source point of the Heart channel. The Spiritual Pivot in Chapter 6 recommends the use of the shu-stream points in the treatment of disorders of the zang, whilst in Chapter 1 it says ‚ÄúWhen the five zang are diseased, select [from] the twelve yuan-source [points]‚Äù. Sh√©nm√©n HE-7 is an essential point to treat i. all disorders of the spirit, and ii. all deficiency disorders of the Heart zang.

Sh√©nm√©n HE-7 (Spirit Gate) is the foremost acupuncture point to calm and regulate the spirit. According to the Spiritual Pivot13 ‚Äúthe Heart is the residence of the spirit‚Äù. Disturbance of the spirit may broadly be divided into two main categories: deficiency patterns (mainly of Heart blood or yin) and excess patterns (Heart fire, phlegm or phlegm-fire). When Heart blood or yin are deficient they are no longer able to nourish the Heart and provide the material basis for the Heart to store and anchor the spirit. As a consequence the spirit loses its harmony and becomes restless and unquiet, resulting in such symptoms as anxiety and fearfulness, poor memory, restless zang disorder, insomnia and disturbed sleep. If Heart qi is deficient (especially when accompanied by qi deficiency of the Gall Bladder), a person will be easily frightened and apprehensive. According to the Spiritual Pivot14 "When Heart qi is deficient there is sadness; when excess there is ceaseless laughter". If the Heart loses contact with its associated emotion, joy, a person will be prone to ceaseless and inappropriate laughter. When Heart fire rages out of control it agitates and excites the spirit leading to such symptoms as severe insomnia and mental hyperactivity. When phlegm, or phlegm-fire, obstruct the portals of the Heart, the spirit will be disturbed to varying degrees, ranging from milder manifestations such as insomnia, talking during sleep, disorientation, agitation and restlessness, to the more severe symptoms of dementia, mania, mad laughter, insulting behaviour and epilepsy. Whatever the pattern, Sh√©nm√©n HE-7 may be used to help restore peace and harmony to the spirit.

The Heart is unique in being susceptible to the four principal kinds of deficiency (qi, blood, yin and yang), Sh√©nm√©n HE-7, the shu-stream and yuan-source point of the Heart channel, may be used in any of these situations, especially in cases of deficiency of blood and yin. In practice, the tonifying action of Sh√©nm√©n HE-7 is enhanced and focused through its combination with other suitable points.

Palpitations are a common symptom of Heart disorder. Although fundamentally a disorder of Heart qi (the active, moving aspect of the Heart zang), palpitations may accompany virtually any Heart pattern, whether deficient or excess. Through its action of regulating and tonifying the qi of the Heart, Sh√©nm√©n HE-7 is indicated for all kinds of palpitations, including fright palpitations and pounding of the Heart (see T≈çngl«ê HE-5).

The Heart channel ascends to the throat and Sh√©nm√©n HE-7 is able to clear heat from the channel giving rise to swelling, congestion, dryness and pain of the throat.

Finally, the Heart channel is interiorly-exteriorly coupled with the Small Intestine channel which is paired with the Bladder channel (taiyang) according to six channel theory. This linkage has traditionally been used to explain the relationship between Heart disharmony and urinary disorders, and in the case of Sh√©nm√©n HE-7 its ability (emphasised in its inclusion in many classical combinations) to treat enuresis due to accumulation of heat in the Bladder.

Summary of clinical application
The principal Heart channel point to regulate the spirit: insomnia, talking during sleep, poor memory, mania-depression, epilepsy, dementia, desire to laugh, mad laughter, insulting people, sadness, fear and fright, disorientation, restless zang disorder (see Lingdao HE-4), loss of voice.
Regulates (and as the shu-stream and yuan-source point is the principal Heart channel point to tonify) the Heart zang: Heart pain, palpitations, fright palpitations, pounding of the Heart.
