## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

N√®it√≠ng ST-44, the ying-spring and water point of the Stomach channel, was included by Ma Dan-yang, the great physician of the Jin dynasty, among his 'eleven heavenly star points'20, his grouping of the most vital acupuncture points of the human body.

According to the Classic of Difficulties41 ying-spring points are indicated for "heat in the body". As a distal point, the principal action of N√®it√≠ng ST-44 is to clear heat and fire from the Stomach channel, most especially its upper portion. It is a primary point in the treatment of many heat disorders of the head and face such as toothache, pain of the face or eye, nosebleed, throat painful obstruction etc. It is frequently combined for this purpose with H√©g«î L.I.-4. In the treatment of toothache, some sources recommend the use of N√®it√≠ng ST-44 for the lower jaw and H√©g«î L.I.-4 for the upper jaw, whilst others consider N√®it√≠ng ST-44 equally adept at treating both the upper and lower jaw. This is borne out by the pathway of the Stomach primary channel which descends from the eye region to enter the upper gum, joins the Governing vessel at R√©nzh≈çng DU-26 and then circles around the lips and descends to meet the Conception vessel at Ch√©ngjiƒÅng REN-24. Pain of the face almost invariably involves disorder of the Stomach channel, and N√®it√≠ng ST-44 is an essential point in the treatment of disorders such as trigeminal neuralgia, often in combination with local points such as D√¨cƒÅng ST-4, Ji√°chƒì ST-6 and Xi√†guƒÅn ST-7. The Stomach channel also makes various connections with the throat and nose. The primary channel descends alongside the throat, the luo-connecting channel terminates at the throat, the primary channel originates at Y√≠ngxiƒÅng L.I.-20 and ascends to the root of the nose and the divergent channel passes alongside the nose. Both throat painful obstruction and nosebleed can be due to heat accumulating in the yangming channel, in the latter case causing reckless movement of the blood.

The second important action of N√®it√≠ng ST-44 is to harmonise the intestines and clear dampness and heat, and it is indicated in the treatment of such disorders as diarrhoea, dysenteric disorder, blood in the stools, constipation and abdominal pain.

One special condition for which N√®it√≠ng ST-44 is indicated is the symptom of hands and feet counterflow cold, where only the hands and feet are cold but the body is warm. This may occur in the pattern known as 'true heat, false cold', where heat constrained in the interior prevents the yang qi from circulating to the limbs. Despite the apparent cold, the other symptoms, as well as the pulse and the tongue, are indicative of heat and constraint. This condition must be differentiated from 'cold collapse' (cold inversion) where either the whole limb or the areas distal to the elbows and knees are cold.

Finally, like many points of the Stomach channel, N√®it√≠ng ST-44 has an action on calming the spirit. It is particularly suited to the treatment of depressive type disorders, and is indicated for aversion to the sound of people talking and a desire for silence.

Summary of clinical application
Clears heat and fire from the upper reaches of the channel: toothache, pain of the lower teeth, pain of the eye, pain of the face, deviation of the mouth and eye, nosebleed, throat painful obstruction, tinnitus.
Harmonises the intestines and clears damp-heat: abdominal pain and distention, borborygmus, diarrhoea, dysenteric disorder, bloody stools, thirst, constipation.
For hands and feet counterflow cold (cold hands and feet with a warm body). Also pain and swelling of the dorsum of the foot.
