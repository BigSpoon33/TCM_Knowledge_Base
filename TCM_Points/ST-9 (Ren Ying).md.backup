  location_description: Level with the tip of and 1.5 cun lateral to the laryngeal
    prominence, in the depression between the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid
    muscle and the lateral border of the thyroid cartilage.
  location_notes: 'Note: the carotid artery lies just deep to, and can be readily
    palpated at, the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This point
    therefore lies between the carotid artery and the lateral border of the thyroid
    cartilage.

    i. Ask the patient to lie flat and remove any pillow. Palpate the laryngeal prominence,
    and then, laterally, the lateral border of the thyroid cartilage. A little more
    laterally than this, the carotid artery may be felt. ii. In females the laryngeal
    prominence is not as pronounced as in males. If it is indistinct, palpate the
    depression formed by the lower border of the hyoid bone and the upper border of
    the thyroid cartilage at the midline. The laryngeal prominence lies just below
    this.'

  needling_depth: 0.5 to 1 cun
  needling_cautions:
  - according to most classical texts, this point is contraindicated to moxibustion.
  - care should be taken to avoid puncturing the carotid artery which must be palpated
    and then held laterally during needling. Use the index finger of one hand to define
    and enlarge the space between the lateral border of the thyroid cartilage and
    the artery and needle into this space with the other hand. This needling method
    should not be attempted by those who have not had appropriate clinical supervision.

## 📍 Location

Level with the tip of and 1.5 cun lateral to the laryngeal prominence, in the depression between the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the lateral border of the thyroid cartilage.

**Location Notes:**
Note: the carotid artery lies just deep to, and can be readily palpated at, the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. This point therefore lies between the carotid artery and the lateral border of the thyroid cartilage.

i. Ask the patient to lie flat and remove any pillow. Palpate the laryngeal prominence, and then, laterally, the lateral border of the thyroid cartilage. A little more laterally than this, the carotid artery may be felt. ii. In females the laryngeal prominence is not as pronounced as in males. If it is indistinct, palpate the depression formed by the lower border of the hyoid bone and the upper border of the thyroid cartilage at the midline. The laryngeal prominence lies just below this.

## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Rényíng ST-9 is also known by its alternative name Tianwuhui (Heaven's Five Meetings). It is one of five points known as 'window of heaven' (literally 'five regions of the window of heaven') points in the Spiritual Pivot5 which states "headache due to rebellion of yang, fullness of the chest with difficulty in breathing, choose Rényíng ST-9". Located in the pivotal neck region, Rényíng ST-9 dramatically illustrates the characteristic ability of this group of points to re-establish harmony in the flow of qi between the body and the head. The rebellion of qi, which arises when the qi in the lower regions is disordered and chaotic, may manifest in various ways. In the head it gives rise to headache, dizziness and redness of the face; in the neck region it stagnates giving rise to scrofula and goitre; in the middle and upper jiao it injures the normal descent of Stomach and Lung qi and gives rise to vomiting, sudden turmoil disorder, wheezing, asthma and fullness of the chest.

According to Zhou Zhi-cong's commentary on the above passage from the Spiritual Pivot, the condition known as inversion qi (disordered, chaotic and rebellious qi) underlies the clinical manifestations of all the points of the window of heaven. One of the manifestations of inversion qi is sudden acute pain, and this echoes the important modern use of Rényíng ST-9 for acute lumbar sprain, as well as sprain and severe pain in any region of the body. The ability of Rényíng ST-9 to reorder rebellion and upsurge of qi also explains its strong action in reducing hypertension.

According to the chapter 'Discourse On the Seas' of the Spiritual Pivot6 Rényíng ST-9 (along with Shānzhōng REN-17, Yǎmén DU-15 and Dàzhuī DU-14) is a point of the 'sea of qi'. This passage gives the following indications for insufficiency and excess of the sea of qi "When the sea of qi is in excess there is fullness in the chest, urgent breathing and a red complexion. When the sea of qi is insufficient, there is scanty energy insufficient for speech". The dual and overlapping properties of Rényíng ST-9 as a point of the sea of qi and a point of the window of heaven underline its importance in harmonising and redistributing disordered qi in the body.

As long ago as the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic, observation and palpation of the pulse at Rényíng ST-9 was considered an important diagnostic method. The Essential Questions7 in discussing obstructed urination describes a pattern of "heat in the body like charcoal, the neck and chest are obstructed as if separated, a restless and abundant pulse at Rényíng ST-9 and dyspnoea with counterflow qi". Elsewhere in the Essential Questions great diagnostic significance is ascribed to the relative strengths of the pulses at the wrist and at Rényíng ST-9, whilst Zhang Zhong-jing refers to three methods of pulse diagnosis (Rényíng ST-9 in the upper, the wrist pulse in the middle and Chōngyáng ST-42 in the lower). Because of the complications inherent in these methods, they were abandoned relatively early in the history of Chinese medicine in favour of focusing on the wrist pulse.
