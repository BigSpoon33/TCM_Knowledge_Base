## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The Pericardium primary channel originates in the chest, its divergent channel enters the chest, its sinew channel disperses in the chest and over the anterior and posterior ribs and its luo-connecting channel connects with the Heart. Nèiguān P-6, a point of the Pericardium channel, is also the confluent point of the Yin Linking vessel which ascends through the chest. According to the Classic of Difficulties9 "When the Yin Linking vessel is diseased, Heart pain will result". In the Ode of the Obstructed River the use of Nèiguān P-6 is referred to as one of 'the eight therapeutic methods'. In this description of the application of the eight confluent points of the extraordinary vessels to affect specific symptoms and areas of the body, Nèiguān P-6 is indicated for disorders of the chest. The Investigation into Points Along the Channels by the Ming dynasty author Yan Zhen-shi says "Nèiguān P-6 treats all kinds of pain of the zangfu, chest and lateral costal region". Furthermore, Nèiguān P-6 was included among the 'six command points' (a grouping derived by later commentators from Gao Wu's 'four command points') for its pre-eminent effect on diseases of the chest and lateral costal region. Nèiguān P-6, therefore, has long been considered the single most important distal point for disorders of the chest and it is one of the primary points in acupuncture analgesia for chest surgery. Its range of actions extends not only to the Heart, but also to the Lung.

Pain and stuffiness of the Heart and chest may result from various aetiologies including i. Heart qi and yang deficiency, ii. accumulation of cold, iii. accumulation of phlegm, iv.. blood stasis, v.. constrained Liver qi, vi. traumatic injury. Whatever the pattern, Nèiguān P-6 forms an essential part of any point combination. In the treatment of angina pectoris, however, certain doctors emphasise the use of Xīmén P-4 (the xi-cleft point of the Pericardium channel) during acute attacks and Nèiguān P-6 during remission. Nèiguān P-6 is also effective to treat other disorders of the chest such as asthma and cough, as well as pain in the lateral costal region and hypochondrium. These last two symptoms reflect not only the pathway of the Pericardium sinew channel, but also the relationship of Nèiguān P-6 to stagnation of Liver qi, explained by the paired relationship of the Pericardium and Liver jueyin channels. Nèiguān P-6, therefore, is especially effective in treating stagnation of Liver qi anywhere in the upper and middle jiao.

The Pericardium is the 'wrapping' of the Heart which stores the spirit, and the Pericardium luo-connecting channel links Nèiguān P-6 directly with the Heart. The action of Nèiguān P-6 on regulating the Heart zang and calming the spirit emphasises its dual effect on both the physical and emotional aspects of the Heart. It is an important point in the treatment of palpitations, pounding of the Heart and disorders of Heart rhythm, and is also one of the main acupuncture points for regulating and calming the spirit and treating a wide range of emotional disorders whatever the underlying pattern. It is therefore indicated for insomnia, epilepsy, mania, poor memory, loss of memory following windstroke, fright, sadness, fear and apprehension.

The Investigation into Points Along the Channels, echoing many other classical texts, states that Nèiguān P-6 is indicated "for disharmony of the Stomach and Spleen". The Pericardium primary and divergent channels both descend through the diaphragm to connect with the middle and lower jiao, and this explains the powerful effect of Nèiguān P-6 on the function of the middle jiao. Nèiguān P-6 is the pre-eminent point to treat nausea and vomiting due to any aetiology, including vomiting of pregnancy and the side-effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Its considerable effect in the treatment of such side-effects has rendered it the subject of more research in recent years than any other acupuncture point. Nèiguān P-6 is further indicated for distention, fullness and pain of the epigastrium and abdomen, and is often combined with Gōngsūn SP-4, the confluent point of the Penetrating vessel, for this purpose.

The Pericardium channel belongs to fire, and like many other points of the channel Nèiguān P-6 is indicated for a variety of manifestations of heat, including fevers, jaundice, red face with hot skin, painful urinary dysfunction, cracked and bleeding tongue etc.

Finally the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion gives specific indications for excess and deficiency of the luo-connecting points. In the case of Nèiguān P-6 these are sudden Heart pain (excess); stiffness [and pain] of the head [and neck] (deficiency).

Summary of clinical application
“Neiguan P-6 treats all kinds of pain of the zangfu, chest and lateral costal region” (Yan Zhen-shi, Ming dynasty).
