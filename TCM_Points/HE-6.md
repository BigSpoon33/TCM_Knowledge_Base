## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Yīnxī HE-6 is the xi-cleft point of the Heart channel. The xi-cleft points are where the qi and blood, which flow relatively superficially along the channels from the jing-well points, gather and plunge more deeply. The xi-cleft points in general are indicated in the treatment of acute conditions and pain, whilst the xi-cleft points of the yin channels have an additional action of treating disorders of blood. Yīnxī HE-6 is indicated for Heart pain due to blood stasis, and bleeding disorders due to excessive heat agitating the blood. However, in terms of both these actions, Xīmén P-4 the xi-cleft point of the Pericardium channel, is clinically more important. Acute severe pain from blood stasis which threatens the survival of the Heart zang is therefore primarily treated by using points of the Pericardium channel, the 'protector' of the Heart. This is reflected in the statement in the Spiritual Pivot12 "The Heart is the great master of the five zang and six fu and the residence of the essence-spirit ... If the Heart is injured, the spirit will depart; if the spirit departs, the person will die ... therefore the pathogenic qi that attacks the Heart will be diverted to reside in the Pericardium".

The forte of Yīnxī HE-6 lies in its ability to treat the yin fluids of the Heart. According to the Ode to Elucidate Mysteries "Reducing Yīnxī HE-6 will stop night sweating and treat steaming bone disorder in children". This underlines the primary application of Yīnxī HE-6 in clinical practice. According to Essential Readings from the Medical Tradition "That which is stored by the Heart internally is blood, externally it is emitted as sweat; sweat is the fluid of the Heart". Owing to this close relationship between the Heart blood and sweating, and the ability of the xi-cleft points to harmonise the blood, Yīnxī HE-6 is an essential point in the treatment of night sweating due to deficiency of either yin or Heart blood. Night is the time of maximum yin, and during sleep (when the body is covered and the more yang defensive qi is no longer needed to protect the surface) the defensive qi enters deep within the yin to be nourished. If yin is deficient, it cannot draw and hold the defensive qi inside, and deficiency heat floats to the exterior and forces out the fluids as sweat. Alternatively, when Heart blood is deficient, the balance of qi and blood is disturbed and the qi floats to the surface causing night sweating, characterised by less intense heat sensations than the yin deficiency pattern. Controlling night sweating is always a priority of treatment, since the sweat emitted in this disorder (known in Chinese as 'robbing sweat') contains yin nutrient and its loss further aggravates the deficiency. It should be noted that night sweating, although most often due to the two patterns described above, may also occur as a result of other patterns of disharmony, specifically damp-heat, Spleen deficiency with retention of dampness, half-interior/half-exterior pathogen disorders and disharmony of nutritive qi and defensive qi. Due to its important action in stopping night sweating, Yīnxī HE-6 may be used in any of these patterns in combination with appropriate points.

Steaming bone disorder is a form of fever from yin deficiency. It is characterised by a sensation of heat deep within the bones radiating outwards to the skin, and is accompanied by afternoon fever, restless sleep and night sweating. It is a profound form of yin deficiency with raging heat and is usually seen in the context of serious disease. Yīnxī HE-6 is one of the principal points used to treat this pattern.

Finally, as the xi-cleft point of the Heart channel, Yīnxī HE-6 is able to soothe and calm the Heart in acute situations and is indicated for acute fright - with or without palpitations. It is also specifically indicated for 'counterflow inversion fright qi'. This refers to loss of consciousness (inversion pattern) that arises when severe anger depresses the qi, or fright and fear rapidly and violently descend the qi.

Summary of clinical application
Important point for night sweating and steaming bone disorder. “Reducing Yīnxī HE-6 will stop night sweating and treat steaming bone disorder in children” (Ode to Elucidate Mysteries).
Treats blood stasis in the Heart and chest: Heart pain, unbearable stabbing pain of the Heart and fullness of the chest, although Pericardium channel points (e.g. Xīmén P-4 and Nèiguān P-6) are preferred clinically.
