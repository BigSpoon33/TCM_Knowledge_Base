## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Shàngwǎn REN-13 (Upper Cavity) is also known as Shangguan (Upper Controller). This point was traditionally considered to affect the upper portion of the Stomach whilst Xiàwǎn REN-10 (Lower Cavity) was considered to affect its lower portion. Between these two points lies Zhōngwǎn REN-12 (Middle Cavity). The Spiritual Pivot 18 states "When there is difficult ingestion and obstruction in the diaphragm, this indicates the pathogen is in the Stomach. When the disorder is in the upper cavity, then needle Shàngwǎn REN-13 to restrain the rebellion and descend it. When the disorder is in the lower cavity, then needle Xiàwǎn REN-10 to scatter and move it". Shàngwǎn REN-13 is indicated for rebellion of Stomach qi manifesting as nausea, vomiting, vomiting of blood and Stomach reflux and for stagnation in the epigastrium and abdomen manifesting as pain, distention, fullness and masses.

The Conception vessel ascends through the middle of the chest, whilst Shàngwǎn REN-13 is a meeting point of the Conception vessel with the Stomach and Small Intestine channels, both of which connect with the Heart via their primary or secondary pathways. Shàngwǎn REN-13 is indicated (and included in classical combinations) for heat, agitation and pain of the Heart and palpitations. In clinical practice however, Jùguè REN-14, the next point along the channel and the front-mu point of the Heart, is more commonly used for such Heart disorders.

Summary of clinical application
“When there is difficult ingestion and obstruction in the diaphragm, this indicates the pathogen is in the Stomach. When the disorder is in the upper cavity, then needle Shangwan REN-13 to restrain the rebellion and descend it” (Spiritual Pivot): treats rebellion of Stomach qi (nausea, vomiting, vomiting of blood, Stomach reflux) and stagnation in the epigastrium and abdomen (pain, distention, fullness and masses).
For, heat, agitation and pain of the Heart and palpitations.
