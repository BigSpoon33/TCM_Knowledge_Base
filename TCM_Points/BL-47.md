## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

H√∫nm√©n BL-47 is level with GƒÅnsh≈´ BL-18, the back-shu point of the Liver. The Liver stores the ethereal soul (hun), but despite its striking name (Gate of the Ethereal Soul), psychological and emotional indications for this point are notable by their absence in major classical texts63. H√∫nm√©n BL-47 does, however, have some action on regulating the Liver qi and soothing the sinews, and is indicated for fullness and distention of the chest and lateral costal region, contraction of the sinews, and bone and joint pain of the whole body. It is also able to regulate the middle jiao, treating disharmony of both the Spleen (diarrhoea, borborygmus) and Stomach (difficult ingestion, vomiting).

According to the Essential Questions64, the five outer Bladder points level with the five zang back-shu points (i.e. P√≤h√π BL-42, Sh√©nt√°ng BL-44, H√∫nm√©n BL-47, Y√¨sh√® BL-49 and Zh√¨sh√¨ BL-52) drain heat from the five zang, an action shared by the back-shu points of the five zang.
