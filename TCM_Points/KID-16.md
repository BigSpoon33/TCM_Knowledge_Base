## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Huāngshū KID-16 lies on the same level as Shénquè REN-8, Tiānshū ST-25 and Dàhéng SP-15, all points with a strong action on the intestines. Various classics recommend Huāngshū KID-16 for dry stools, whilst the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion specifically recommended it for accumulation of cold in the Large Intestine giving rise to dry stools and cutting pain of the abdomen. It should be remembered that constipation may be due to accumulation of cold, whether deficiency cold deriving from insufficiency of Kidney yang and usually seen in the elderly or debilitated, or excess cold, usually from dietary factors. In the former case the stool may be dry, not from the usual causes (heat or deficiency of fluids, blood or yin) but due to Kidney yang deficiency which fails to circulate fluids.

Summary of clinical application
Level with Tianshu ST-25 and Daheng SP-15; regulates the intestines: constipation (especially due to excess or deficiency cold), dry stools, borborygmus, diarrhoea.
