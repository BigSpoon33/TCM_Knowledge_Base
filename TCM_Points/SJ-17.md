## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Yìfēng SJ-17 is a meeting point of the Sanjiao and Gall Bladder channels, both of which enter the ear, and is an essential local point in the treatment of all ear disorders including tinnitus, deafness, discharge, itching, redness, swelling and pain.

As the name of this point (Wind Screen) indicates, Yìfēng SJ-17 has an action on expelling exterior pathogenic wind and treating the manifestations of internal wind, and is used widely for facial paralysis due to windstroke or Bell's palsy, trigeminal neuralgia, spasm and lockjaw.

Through its action of clearing heat and circulating the channel, Yìfēng SJ-17 is also indicated for local disorders such as mumps, scrofula, swelling of the cheek and toothache.
