## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Xiǎohǎi SI-8 is the he-sea and earth point of the Small Intestine channel. Despite these important characteristics, it is a relatively infrequently used point, reflected by its appearance in very few classical combinations. It is indicated for many different kinds of swelling involving the gums, throat, cheek, elbow and axilla, as well as scrofula of the neck or axilla. Clinically, however, it is primarily used for pain of the scapula and the postero-lateral aspect of the shoulder, arm and elbow. Like Zhīzhèng SI-7, Xiǎohǎi SI-8 is also able to regulate its coupled Heart zang and is indicated for such disorders as epilepsy, tongue thrusting (where the tongue is repeatedly thrust out of the mouth like a snake's tongue), mad walking and agitation of the Heart.

Finally it is worth noting that despite being the he-sea point of the Small Intestine, Xiǎohǎi SI-8 has no significant action on its respective fu. This reflects the essential contradiction that whilst the Small and Large Intestine fu are located in the lower jiao, their channels run along the upper limb. As a consequence, points of these channels have relatively little action on the fu, and disorders of the Small Intestine are rather treated by points such as Xiàjùxū ST-39 or Xiǎochángshū BL-27, the lower he-sea and back-shu points of the Small Intestine respectively.

Summary of clinical application
Clears heat and swelling from the upper portion of the channel: scrofula, swelling and pain of the throat, swelling of the cheek, swelling of the gums, swelling and pain of the elbow and axilla, toothache, dizziness, headache, deafness.
Clinically mostly used to treat disorders of the neck, scapula, shoulder, arm and elbow.
