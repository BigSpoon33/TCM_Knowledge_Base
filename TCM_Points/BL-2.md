## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Z«énzh√∫ BL-2 is an important and frequently used local point for the treatment of disorders of the eye and the surrounding region. It may be substituted for Jƒ´ngm√≠ng BL-1 in a variety of eye disorders (primarily those due to attack by exterior pathogenic factors), especially by practitioners with insufficient clinical experience in needling points close to the eyeball. For this purpose it may be needled to join with Jƒ´ngm√≠ng BL-1, or in the case of heat patterns pricked to bleed. Its effect on redness and itching of the eyes, combined with its ability to treat rhinitis and sneezing, renders it particularly suitable in the treatment of hay fever.

The sphere of action of Z«énzh√∫ BL-2 is not confined to the treatment of eye disorders however, and it is frequently used as a local point for frontal headache, pain of the eyebrow region, sinus pain and facial paralysis, and more widely (see combinations below) for one-sided or generalised head wind, and headache following alcohol intoxication. The Bladder divergent channel winds around the anus, and Z«énzh√∫ BL-2 is indicated for pain of haemorrhoids, an illustration of the principle of using points above to treat disorders below.

Summary of clinical application
Local point for eye disorders including blurred or dim vision, lacrimation on exposure to wind, night blindness, redness, swelling and pain of the eye, itching of the eyes, twitching of the eyelids, bursting sensation of the eye.
Local point for pain of the eyebrow and supraorbital region, rhinitis, sneezing, sinus pain and frontal headache.
