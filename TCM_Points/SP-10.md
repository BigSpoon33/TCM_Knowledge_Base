## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

The name of Xu√®h«éi SP-10 (Sea of Blood) reflects its pre-eminent role in treating various disorders at the blood level. It is generally recognised as having two principal actions: i. invigorating the blood and dispelling stasis, and ii. cooling the blood. These two actions find their expression in its ability to treat a wide range of gynaecological and dermatological disorders due either to blood stasis or to heat in the blood.

As far as gynaecology is concerned, normal menstruation depends on a number of factors including the smooth circulation of blood. Impairment of blood circulation and consequent stasis may be due to a variety of causes including stagnation or deficiency of qi, traumatic injury, haemorrhage, penetration of cold or heat, chronic disease or emotional factors, and may give rise to many different disorders of menstruation. These include dysmenorrhoea and uterine bleeding characterised by severe fixed pain and the discharge of dark or clotted blood, and amenorrhoea accompanied by distention and pain, a purple coloured tongue and a choppy pulse. By contrast, if heat enters the blood level, most frequently due to internally generated heat from the Liver or Heart or overconsumption of excessively heating foods, then two principal conditions may arise: i. the movement of blood may become reckless and overflow its bounds leading to profuse uterine bleeding, or less commonly, the heat may desiccate the blood leading to amenorrhoea. In both cases there will be signs of heat such as a red dry tongue and a rapid pulse. In fact, both the blood cooling and blood invigorating properties of Xu√®h«éi SP-10 come together in its ability to treat uterine bleeding. Blood heat is the most commonly seen pattern of uterine bleeding, but as well as cooling blood, treatment must emphasise resolving stasis, since any pathological bleeding may lead to pooling and stagnation of extravasated blood. This is expressed in the Chinese medicine saying "where there is haemorrhage there is stasis". The close inter-relationship between blood heat and blood stasis is further illustrated by the fact that blood heat may condense and dry the blood giving rise to stasis, as stated in the Treatise on Epidemic Warm Febrile Disease18 "Because latent stagnant fire evaporates the blood's fluid, the blood simmers and forms stasis".

Some authorities further attribute blood nourishing properties to Xu√®h«éi SP-10 and incorporate it into prescriptions for the treatment of blood deficiency. In the light of Xu√®h«éi SP-10's pre-eminence in invigorating blood, this action reflects the saying in Chinese medicine "if blood stasis is not transformed, new blood cannot be generated". This refers to situations where blood stasis has pooled outside the channels, leading directly to blood deficiency as sufficient blood is no longer available to nourish the body. This complex pattern of haemorrhage with both consequent blood stasis and blood deficiency is commonly encountered after childbirth and profuse uterine bleeding.

As far as dermatology is concerned, blood disharmony often plays a central role. The main dermatological patterns treated by Xu√®h«éi SP-10 are heat in the blood level characterised by red lesions, and blood stasis characterised by purple lesions. Xu√®h«éi SP-10 may also be used for the concomitant blood deficiency and stasis seen for example in eczema with thickening of the skin (lichenification) or post-herpetic neuralgia. Xu√®h«éi SP-10 may also be used to treat the manifestations of wind in skin diseases, the most important of which is intolerable itching. This illustrates the Chinese medicine saying "to treat wind first treat the blood; once blood moves wind will be dispelled".

Although the action of Xu√®h«éi SP-10 on invigorating and cooling blood is classically confined to the two principal areas of gynaecology and dermatology, there are in fact relatively few acupuncture points able to treat the blood directly. For this reason, its application may be extended to any disorder in the body with these pathologies. Thus the Song of the Primary Points of the Fourteen Channels says "Xu√®h«éi SP-10 can treat all blood diseases".

Summary of clinical application
One of the main points to move blood stasis and cool blood heat, principally in menstrual and skin disorders: irregular menstruation, dysmenorrhoea, amenorrhoea, uterine bleeding, uterine bleeding containing clots, urticaria, eczema, erysipelis (cinnabar toxin), herpes zoster, painful hot sores. ‚ÄúXu√®h«éi SP-10 can treat all blood diseases‚Äù (Song of the Primary Points of the Fourteen Channels).
Ascribed some action of nourishing blood, especially when allied with blood stasis: ‚ÄúIf blood stasis is not transformed, new blood cannot be generated‚Äù.
