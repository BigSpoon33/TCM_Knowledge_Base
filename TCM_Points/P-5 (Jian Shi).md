## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

The key action of Jiānshǐ P-5 is to transform phlegm in the upper jiao, and predominantly in the Heart. Together with Fēnglóng ST-40 it is one of the two main acupuncture points to treat phlegm disorders. Phlegm obstructing the Heart may arise in one of the following ways: i. excess of any of the seven emotions results in stagnation of qi which hinders the smooth circulation of body fluids, and by transforming into fire, further condenses the stagnant body fluids to form phlegm; ii. stagnation of Liver qi impairs the Spleen's function of transforming and transporting fluids which form phlegm and rise with stagnant qi to disturb the Heart; iii. high fever condenses the body fluids into phlegm, in which case Chinese medicine convention ascribes the disorder to the Pericardium; iv. fright generates phlegm, a concept expounded by Gong Ju-zhong in A Spot of Snow on a Red Hot Stove6 "Phlegm is produced by fright. The spirit leaves its residence, and when the residence is empty, the fluids will form phlegm".

When phlegm or phlegm-fire obstruct and agitate the portals of the Heart, the spirit will be disturbed to varying degrees. There may be milder symptoms such as agitation, apprehension, propensity to fright, poor memory, restlessness and being easily startled, or more severe symptoms such as mania, manic raving, epilepsy and what was known as 'ghost evil', a disorder probably attributed to demonic possession. Jiānshǐ P-5 also treats phlegm manifestations such as drooling following windstroke, vomiting of foam, swelling of the axilla, goitre, scrofula, and plumstone qi (globus hystericus), a form of stagnation and obstruction by qi and phlegm characterised by a sensation of throat blockage which worsens or ameliorates according to fluctuations in the emotional state. The importance of Jiānshǐ P-5 in the treatment of mania disorder and epilepsy is reflected by the fact that Sun Si-miao's Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas suggested that this point was Guilu (one of the thirteen ghost points), rather than Shēnmài BL-62 which was said to correspond to Guilu in the Thousand Ducat Formulas.

The Pericardium channel and its interiorly-exteriorly related Sanjiao channel both connect with the upper, middle and lower jiao. The action of Jiānshǐ P-5, therefore, is not confined to the upper jiao. In the middle jiao, like Nèiguān P-6, it regulates the function of the Stomach and promotes its descending function, being indicated when Stomach qi stagnates giving rise to pain, and when Stomach qi rebels upwards giving rise to vomiting and nausea. Its ability to regulate the Stomach is considered less powerful than that of Nèiguān P-6, but it may be used when nausea and vomiting is due to retention of phlegm in the middle jiao. Jiānshǐ P-5 is also indicated for sudden turmoil disorder characterised by acute vomiting and diarrhoea.

According to the Essential Questions7 "The bao mai (uterine channel) pertains to the Heart and is connected with the uterus". Jiānshǐ P-5 is one of the few points of either the Heart or Pericardium channels that has an action on gynaecological disorders, being indicated for irregular menstruation, dysmenorrhoea, clotted menstrual flow, retention of the lochia and leucorrhoea. Its action on the lower jiao also extends to the treatment of painful urinary dysfunction and urethral pain.

Finally, according to the Spiritual Pivot8 the jing-river points are indicated for 'changes in the patient's voice' and Jiānshǐ P-5 is indicated for halting speech and loss of voice.
Important point to transform phlegm in the Heart and upper jiao: agitation, propensity to fright, poor memory, restlessness, easily startled, mania, manic raving, possession by 'ghost evil', epilepsy, drooling following windstroke, vomiting of foam, goitre, plumstone qi (globus hystericus).
The Pericardium channel descends through the middle jiao: essential point for nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain.
“The bao mai (uterine channel) pertains to the Heart and is connected with the uterus” (Essential Questions): Jiānshǐ P-5 treats irregular menstruation, dysmenorrhoea, clotted menstrual flow, retention of the lochia and leucorrhoea.
