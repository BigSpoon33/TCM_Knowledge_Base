## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Fēngchí GB-20, located at the nape of the neck, occupies a pivotal position between the head and the body and is one of the pre-eminent acupuncture points to treat all diseases of the head, brain and sensory organs, especially the eyes.

Wind, a yang pathogenic factor whose nature is to harass the uppermost (and therefore most yang) part of the body, may be of two kinds: i. exterior pathogenic wind which attacks the most superficial portion of the body, and ii. interior wind which has its origin in disharmony of the Liver. As its name (Wind Pool) implies, Fēngchí GB-20 is an important local point to treat both kinds of wind disease affecting the head.

Exterior wind is known as the 'spearhead of the hundred diseases' and easily combines with other pathogenic factors and drives them into the body. When exterior pathogenic wind, wind-cold or wind-heat injure the body, the characteristic sign is chills and fever. Fēngchí GB-20 is a meeting point of the Gall Bladder channel with both the Yang Motility vessel and the Yang Linking vessel. The Yang Motility vessel is indicated for aversion to wind, whilst the Yang Linking vessel links all the yang channels of the body, including the Governing vessel. Yang corresponds to the exterior while yin corresponds to the interior, and the yang channels as a whole therefore relate more to the exterior portion of the body. According to the Classic of Difficulties3 "when the Yang Linking vessel is diseased, there will be severe chills and fever". Fēngchí GB-20 is especially indicated when injury by wind is accompanied by headache or other symptoms of the head region such as lacrimation, red and sore eyes, nasal congestion and discharge, sore throat, swelling of the face etc.

Fēngchí GB-20 is equally important to pacify pathologically ascending interior wind and to settle yang and clear fire from the head, and is therefore indicated for such disorders as headache, head wind, dizziness, deviation of the mouth and eyes, hemiplegia and lockjaw as well as for hypertension.

According to a saying of Chinese medicine, "The head is the residence of the yang". The Yang Linking vessel links all the yang channels and connects with the Governing vessel (which enters the brain) at Yǎmén DU-15 and Fēngfǔ DU-16, and Fēngchí GB-20 is the single most important acupuncture point in the treatment of headache, whatever the aetiology and whichever the involved channels. A more specific recommendation is found in the Ode of the Jade Dragon which proposes the use of Fēngchí GB-20 for 'head wind with phlegm' and Hégǔ L.I.-4 for 'head wind without phlegm'. In the same way that it treats any variety of headache, Fēngchí GB-20 may be used for dizziness due to any pattern of disharmony.

Fēngchí GB-20 has a strong action on the eyes and nose, and to a lesser extent the ears, and is indicated for red and painful eyes, visual disorders, lacrimation, nosebleed, rhinitis, nasal congestion and discharge, tinnitus and deafness whether due to interior disharmony or exterior wind. By virtue of its connection with the Yang Linking vessel, and hence the Governing vessel, and of its action of pacifying interior wind, it is also effective in 'awakening' the brain and can be used for such symptoms as the sequelae of windstroke, loss of speech following windstroke, epilepsy and loss of memory.

Fēngchí GB-20 has a strong effect on activating the channel and alleviating pain, and is an important point in the treatment of disorders of the neck, shoulders and upper back. It is interesting to note that Fēngchí GB-20 is also indi-cated for lumbar pain and 'crooked lumbar spine leading to flaccidity and lack of strength in the sinews of the neck'.

The wide range of disorders of the head and neck that may be treated by Fēngchí GB-20 is reflected in the variety of needle directions that may be employed at this point. In the treatment of neck disorders, Fēngchí GB-20 is normally needled either perpendicularly or towards opposite Fēngchí GB-20; in the treatment of nose disorders it is needled towards the tip of the nose; in the treatment of eye disorders it is needled towards the opposite eye, and in the treatment of mental disorders towards Yìntáng M-HN-3.

Descends interior wind and uprising yang: headache, head wind, dizziness, deviation of the mouth and eyes, hemiplegia, lockjaw, hypertension.
