## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Although not a major point, Sìbái ST-2 may be used in the following three clinical situations: i. as a substitute for Chéngqì ST-1 in the treatment of eye diseases for those who have not mastered the more difficult technique of needling the latter point, ii. as a local point - often joined to adjacent points - for facial pain and paralysis, and iii. in the treatment of round worms in the bile duct (see Yíngxiāng L.I.-20).

Summary of clinical application
Alternative to Chéngqì ST-1 in the treatment of eye diseases, especially for practitioners without experience of needling Chéngqì ST-1.
Local point for facial pain and paralysis.
For alleviating pain caused by round worms in the bile duct (joined to Yíngxiāng L.I.-20).
