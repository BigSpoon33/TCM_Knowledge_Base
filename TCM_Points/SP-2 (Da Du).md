## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Dàdū SP-2 is the ying-spring and fire point of the Spleen channel and the subject of somewhat contradictory statements in different classics. The Classic of Difficulties3 says that the ying-spring points are indicated for "heat in the body", and indeed the ying-spring points of the twelve channels are usually the principal points to clear heat of excess or deficiency type from their respective zangfu or channel. The Illustrated Classic of Acupuncture Points on the Bronze Man says "when the Spleen is deficient, reinforce Dàdū SP-2", reflecting the status of Dàdū SP-2 as the 'mother' point of the Spleen channel (fire is the mother of earth), according to the principle of tonifying the mother to nourish the child. The Classic of the Jade Dragon simply states that Dàdū SP-2 can treat disharmony of the Spleen and Stomach.

The Spleen dominates the function of the digestive system as a whole, including the Stomach and intestines. Its transportation and transformation function places great demands on the Spleen's qi, and in disharmony the Spleen tends to deficiency, which is why most of the Spleen channel points distal to the knee have some effect on tonifying the Spleen. This deficiency may underlie the patterns of Spleen dampness or damp-heat, either because impaired transportation and transformation leads to the generation of these pathogens inside the body, or because when the Spleen is deficient, the body is especially vulnerable to attack by exterior dampness and damp-heat. It is this picture of Spleen deficiency combined with dampness or damp-heat that is able to reconcile the different statements made in the classics concerning Dàdū SP-2. It should be emphasised however, that among the more distal points of the Spleen channel, the Spleen tonifying action of Dàdū SP-2 is relatively minor, and its primary action is in reducing excess patterns.

Dàdū SP-2 is indicated for excess dampness or damp-heat manifesting as sudden swelling of the four limbs, heaviness of the body with pain of the bones, swelling of the limbs and oppression of the chest. These indications reflect attack by exterior dampness or damp-heat, often as a consequence of underlying Spleen deficiency. Dàdū SP-2 is also indicated for heat patterns of the Stomach and intestines such as abdominal distention, epigastric pain, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation, and sudden turmoil disorder. The indication 'agitation when hungry and dizziness when full' reflects a pattern of phlegm-heat in the Stomach. The heat clearing action of Dàdū SP-2 extends to the treatment of febrile diseases, and it is especially indicated when fevers are accompanied by absence of sweating.

Finally, Dàdū SP-2 may be used as a local point for disorders of the big toe in combination with points such as Tàibái SP-3 and Xíngjiān LIV-2
