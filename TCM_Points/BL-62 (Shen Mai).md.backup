## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

In the Ode of the Obstructed River the use of Shēnmài BL-62 is referred to as one of 'the eight therapeutic methods'. In this description of the application of the eight confluent points of the extraordinary vessels to affect specific symptoms and areas of the body, Shēnmài BL-62 is indicated "to expel cold and heat and [to treat] one-sided and generalised head wind".

Shēnmài BL-62 is both a point of the taiyang Bladder channel and the confluent point of the Yang Motility vessel, reflected in its alternative name 'Yang Qiao' (Yang Motility). The taiyang (supreme yang) Bladder channel traverses the head and the entire length of the back, the most yang area of the body. It connects with the Governing vessel at points Táodào DU-13, Dàzhuī DU-14, Nǎohù DU-17 and Bǎihuì DU-20, where it enters the brain. The Yang Motility vessel traverses the lateral side of the body and head, connects with the Gall Bladder channel at Fēngchí GB-20 and enters the brain at Fēngfǔ DU-16. Furthermore, the Bladder divergent channel enters the Heart. This network of channel pathways helps to explain the principal actions and indications of this point.

Wind is a yang pathogenic factor characterised by sudden onset, rapid changes, constant or abnormal movement and a tendency to attack the head and upper and outer portions of the body. Wind may be of exterior or interior origin. Taiyang channel is the most exterior of the six channels and is generally the first channel to be attacked by exterior pathogenic wind. Shēnmài BL-62 is particularly indicated for the commonly-seen pattern of attack of exterior wind (usually in combination with either heat or cold) with chills and fever, aversion to wind, stiff neck and headache. Interior wind, by contrast, arises from interior disharmony, principally of the Liver. It rushes upwards, disturbing the brain and leading to such symptoms as lockjaw, opisthotonos, upward staring eyes, deviation of the mouth and eyes, windstroke and hemiplegia. The ability of Shēnmài BL-62 to pacify interior wind and treat such manifestations reflects the extreme yang nature of this point and its channel connections to the head and brain, rather than any action on the Liver zang. In other words Shēnmài BL-62 treats the manifestation of wind rather than the root.

Shēnmài BL-62 (the confluent point of the Yang Motility vessel) is classically indicated for day-time epilepsy, in contrast to Zhàohǎi KID-6 (the confluent point of the Yin Motility vessel) which is classically indicated for night-time epilepsy. Epilepsy principally involves three factors, namely stirring of wind, disturbance of the Heart and brain, and phlegm. The fact that the Bladder primary channel enters the brain and the Bladder divergent channel links with the Heart, combined with the ability of Shēnmài BL-62 to pacify wind, explains its special effect on epilepsy. Under its alternative name of Guilu (Ghost Path) Shēnmài BL-62 was included in a group known as the 'thirteen ghost points' listed by Sun Si-miao for the treatment of epilepsy and mania. Shēnmài BL-62 is further indicated for disorders of the Heart and spirit such as palpitations, insomnia and mania-depression.

The Spiritual Pivot states "When the taiyang [Bladder] channel enters the brain it is divided into the Yin Motility and the Yang Motility; it is here that the yin and yang meet; yang enters the yin and yin moves outwards to the yang, meeting at the inner corner of the eye. When the yang is abundant, the eyes are staring open; when the yin is abundant, the eyes will be closed shut"72 and "[When] defensive qi does not enter into the yin it will frequently remain at the yang. [When] it remains at the yang then yang qi will be full, [when] yang qi is full, the Yang Motility vessel [will become] abundant, [when] it does not enter the yin, then yin qi will become deficient and therefore the eyes will not close"73. These two quotations have served traditionally to further explain the ability of Shēnmài BL-62 to treat insomnia.

Shēnmài BL-62 shares with other distal points of the Bladder channel the ability to clear heat and excess from the head, whether due to exterior pathogens, excess fire, uprising of yang or stirring of wind. It is indicated for head wind and headache affecting both the midline (Bladder channel) and lateral (Yang Motility vessel) portions of the head, for dizziness, nosebleed, deafness and tinnitus, and especially for eye disorders, as both the Bladder channel and the Yang Motility vessel link with the inner canthus.

Shēnmài BL-62 may be needled for various other disorders affecting both the Bladder channel and the Yang Motility vessel, for example pain of both the lumbar region (Bladder channel) and hip (Yang Motility vessel).

Finally, Shēnmài BL-62 is indicated for swelling of the axilla and neck. These indications may be explained by the pathway of the Bladder sinew channel which ascends to the axilla and then emerges at the supraclavicular fossa to cross the neck.

Summary of clinical application
Expels exterior wind (chills and fever, aversion to wind, stiff neck and headache) and pacifies interior wind (lockjaw, opisthotonos, upward staring eyes, deviation of the mouth and eyes, windstroke and hemiplegia).
Clears heat and excess from the head: headache, dizziness, nosebleed, deafness, tinnitus, eye disorders.
Classically indicated for daytime epilepsy and insomnia.
Treats disorder of both the Bladder channel and the Yang Motility vessel (midline and lateral headache, pain of both the lumbar region and hip).
