## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Xi√†li√°n L.I.-8 (Lower Angle) and Sh√†ngli√°n L.I.-9 (Upper Angle) are a reflection on the upper limb of the points Xi√†j√πx≈´ ST-39 (Lower Great Hollow) and Sh√†ngj√πx≈´ ST-37 (Upper Great Hollow), the he-sea points of the Small and Large Intestines respectively, on the lower limb. Xi√†li√°n L.I.-8 is therefore indicated for disorders of the intestines, particularly the Small Intestine, manifesting as fullness, distention and pain of the abdomen, periumbilical pain, insufficiency of Small Intestine qi, blood in the stool and diarrhoea containing undigested food. In clinical practice, however, the points on the lower limb are much more frequently used to treat intestinal disorders.

The Large Intestine divergent channel descends to the breast, and Xi√†li√°n L.I.-8 is indicated for breast abscess, the only point on the Large Intestine channel with this indication.

The action of Xi√†li√°n L.I.-8 on clearing yangming fire and calming the spirit, and thus treating manic raving and mad walking, is similar to that of Y√°ngxƒ´ L.I.-5.

Summary of clinical application
Indicated for Small Intestine disorders although rarely used clinically: lower abdominal pain and distention, periumbilical pain, insufficiency of Small Intestine qi, diarrhoea containing undigested food, blood in the stool, dark urine.
Note that Xialian L.I.-8 (Lower Angle) is a reflection on the upper limb of Xiajuxu ST-39 (Lower Great Void), the lower hesea point of the Small Intestine, on the leg.
