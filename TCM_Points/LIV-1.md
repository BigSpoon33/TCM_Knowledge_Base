## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the Song of the Jade Dragon "For the seven types of shan disorder, choose D√†d≈´n LIV-1, whilst the Essential Questions 1 says "when the pathogen resides in the foot jueyin luo, it will give rise to sudden pain of shan disorder; needle above the nail of the big toe". Shan disorder is a broad category that includes hernia, genital swelling and pain, and severe pain of the lower abdomen. The most common patterns for these disorders include stagnation of qi, accumulation of cold in the Liver channel, damp-heat, traumatic injury and deficiency. D√†d≈´n LIV-1 is the jing-well point of the Liver channel which encircles the genitals and enters the lower abdomen. It is an important point to regulate the qi in these areas and is the pre-eminent distal point in the treatment of any pattern of shan disorder, but as the jing-well point is especially suited to urgent conditions with acute and sudden pain. Both the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic and later texts such as the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion recommend that cross-needling be applied at D√†d≈´n LIV-1, in other words left D√†d≈´n LIV-1 is needled for right shan disorder and vice-versa.

Through its action of regulating qi in the lower jiao D√†d≈´n LIV-1 is also indicated for a variety of disorders of both urination and menstruation. As far as urination is concerned, it is notable that all the distal points of the Liver channel are strongly indicated in classical texts for a wide range of urinary disorders. Some explanation may be offered by the fact that the Liver's free-flowing function is said to assist the qi transformation function of the Bladder, and therefore Liver qi stagnation, Liver damp-heat or Liver fire may all impair the smooth flow of urine giving rise to difficult and painful urination, painful urinary dysfunction (especially qi painful urinary dysfunction) etc. In modern clinical practice, points of the Liver channel are often selected in the treatment of such excess patterns, but it is clear from indications such as frequent urination, enuresis and urinary incontinence that Liver channel points were also considered effective in the treatment of deficiency patterns. This reflects the ability of points of the Liver channel to regulate any disorders of the genito-urinary region.

As far as menstrual disorders are concerned, the Liver stores the blood, and if Liver qi stagnation transforms to heat and enters the blood it will give rise to agitation and turbulence manifesting as irregular menstruation, ceaseless uterine bleeding, menorrhagia or metrorrhagia. The important action of D√†d≈´n LIV-1 on stopping excessive bleeding extends also to blood in the urine and, according to Sun Si-miao, to nosebleed, which is frequently due to upsurging heat of the Liver. It is useful to compare the application of D√†d≈´n LIV-1 with its neighbouring point Y«ênb√†i SP-1. Whilst Y«ênb√†i SP-1 has a wide application for haemorrhage due either to Spleen qi deficiency or blood heat, D√†d≈´n LIV-1 is primarily applicable for haemorrhage due to blood heat.

The focus of D√†d≈´n LIV-1 on shan disorder, disorders of the genitals, urinary diseases and uterine bleeding reflects its close affinity for the lower jiao. In this respect it is something of an exception among the jing-well points, which mostly treat disorders of the head and chest region. Finally, in common with the majority of the jing-well points of the twelve channels, D√†d≈´n LIV-1 is indicated for restoring consciousness in cases of collapse and epilepsy, and calming the spirit, being indicated for fear and fright, mania-depression, worry and oppression and sighing.

Summary of clinical application
Important distal point for shan disorder (a broad category that includes hernia itself, as well as genital swelling and pain and severe pain of the lower abdomen).
For urinary disorders: painful retention of urine, blood in the urine, painful urinary dysfunction, enuresis, frequent urination.
Clears heat from the blood: irregular menstruation, ceaseless uterine bleeding, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, blood in the urine, nosebleed.
