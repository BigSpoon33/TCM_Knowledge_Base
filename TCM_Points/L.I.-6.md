## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Piānlì L.I.-6 is the luo-connecting point of the Large Intestine channel from where the luo-connecting channel diverges, hence the name 'Veering Passage'. From this point the luo-connecting channel ascends to the jaw and ears, whilst the Large Intestine primary channel traverses the lower jaw, nose and face, before joining with the Stomach channel which connects to the eye. Like many distal points of the Large Intestine channel, Piānlì L.I.-6 is effective in clearing wind and heat from all these areas (e.g. toothache, redness and pain of the eyes, nosebleed, rhinitis etc.) and is especially applicable for ear disorders such as tinnitus and deafness due to attack of exterior pathogenic wind and heat.

The luo-connecting channel from Piānlì L.I.-6 joins with its interiorly-exteriorly coupled Lung channel. The Guide to the Classics of Acupuncture states "the luo-connecting points are located between two channels ... if they are punctured, symptoms of the interiorly-exteriorly related channels can be treated9". The yang Large Intestine channel may be seen as the outer reflection of its coupled yin Lung channel, and its points are frequently used to release the exterior portion of the Lung system. When external wind disrupts the function of the Lung in regulating the water passages, there may be acute oedema, especially of the upper part of the body, accompanied by absence of sweating and difficult urination. Piānlì L.I.-6 is the primary point on the Large Intestine channel to open and regulate the water passages and thus treat such symptoms as difficult urination, oedema, ascites and borborygmus with oedema.

Finally the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion gives specific indications for excess and deficiency of the luo-connecting points. In the case of Piānlì L.I.-6, these are tooth decay and deafness (excess); cold teeth and obstruction of the diaphragm (deficiency).

Summary of clinical application
Clears heat and expels wind from the ears (tinnitus, deafness), teeth (toothache, tooth decay, cold teeth), eyes (redness and pain of the eyes, dimness of vision, blurred vision), nose (nosebleed), throat (dry throat, throat painful obstruction) and face (deviation of the mouth, swelling of the cheek).
As the luo-connecting point linking with the Lung channel is able to promote the Lung’s function of regulating the water passages when impaired by exterior pathogens: difficult urination, oedema, ascites, borborygmus with oedema, attack by wind without sweating.
