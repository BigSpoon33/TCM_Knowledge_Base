## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

Gānshū BL-18 is the back-shu point of the Liver, where the qi of the Liver emanates from the interior to the body surface, and like all the back-shu points (especially those of the yin zang) Gānshū BL-18 has a strong action on regulating and tonifying its corresponding zangfu at the deepest level. The principal functions of the Liver are to maintain the free flow of qi, store blood, dominate the sinews and open into the eyes. By spreading Liver qi, nourishing and cooling Liver blood, clearing damp-heat and pacifying wind, Gānshū BL-18 is able to regulate all these aspects of the Liver function.

According to Master Dan-xi of the Jin-Yuan dynasty "The Liver governs spreading". This refers to the Liver's function of ensuring the free and easy flow of qi throughout the body and assisting the normal qi movement of all the zangfu, for example the descending of the Lung and Stomach qi and the ascending of the Spleen qi. Stagnation of Liver qi is considered the pre-eminent pathological pattern of the Liver since it is frequently the starting point of other Liver patterns (for example the transformation of Liver qi into fire) and it commonly accompanies any other pattern of Liver disharmony. The ability of Gānshū BL-18 to promote the free flow of Liver qi is reflected in various ways. Stagnant qi in the upper, middle or lower jiao may give rise to distention and pain of the chest, lateral costal region, epigastrium and hypogastrium as well as to shan disorder. According to the Spiritual Pivot20 "with anger the qi rebels upwards and accumulates in the chest". If Liver qi or Liver fire invade the Lung there will be cough with chest pain, coughing of blood, cough with fullness of the lateral costal region and inability to catch the breath, or shortness of breath. According to Correcting Errors in Medicine by Wang Qing-ren of the Qing dynasty "qi is without form and thus unable to congeal into masses; the development of masses requires form in the shape of blood". If stagnation of qi leads to blood stasis, therefore, there will be abdominal masses. If Liver qi stagnation inhibits the function of the Gall Bladder in secreting bile there will be damp-heat of the Liver and Gall Bladder and consequent jaundice. According to the Spiritual Pivot21 "The Liver stores blood, the blood is the residence of the ethereal soul (hun); when Liver qi is deficient there is fear, when excess there is anger". If stagnation of qi is pronounced, and especially if it transforms to fire, there will be emotional manifestations such as anger, mania-depression, and even epilepsy.

The increasing pressure of prolonged qi stagnation may easily transform to fire. According to the Essential Questions22 "Anger will cause the qi to surge upwards; if it is extreme there is vomiting of blood". Since the Liver stores the blood, the heat of Liver fire or Liver yang may easily transmit to the blood and, given the tendency of the Liver qi to rise excessively, cause reckless upward movement of blood leading to symptoms such as vomiting blood, nosebleed, and spitting and coughing blood.

When Liver blood or Liver yin are insufficient, they will be unable to nourish and moisten those regions of the body dominated by the Liver and irrigated by Liver blood, principally the eyes and the sinews. It is a special property of the back-shu points of the zang that they nourish and regulate their corresponding sense organs. According to the Spiritual Pivot23 "Liver qi opens into the eyes; when the Liver is in harmony, the eyes are able to distinguish the five colours", whilst the Essential Questions24 says "The Liver receives blood so there is sight". Insufficiency of Liver blood or Liver yin may lead to disorders such as blurred vision, night blindness, lacrimation and dizziness. If heat from Liver fire or Liver yang rises to disrupt the eyes, there will be redness, itching and pain. If Liver fire leads to the stirring of wind, there will be upward staring of the eyes. The Investigation into Points Along the Channels therefore states that Gānshū BL-18 is indicated for "all diseases of the eyes pertaining to the Liver". According to the Essential Questions "The Liver dominates the sinews of the entire body"25, and "When a person sleeps the blood returns to the Liver"26. If Liver blood or Liver yin fail to nourish the sinews and thus maintain their softness and flexibility, there may be chronic stiffness and contraction, cramps or pain of the sinews. These symptoms may be especially pronounced both when the body is exhausted and the blood is less effective at nourishing, or during or following sleep or inactivity when the blood returns to the Liver and less is available to circulate throughout the body. This kind of stiffness, contraction, cramping or pain will be even more pronounced when there is concurrent stagnation of Liver qi, or when deficiency of yin or blood leads to stirring up of Liver wind.

According to sayings of Chinese medicine "The Liver governs uprising" and "Anger makes the Liver qi rise to the neck and shoulders". Stagnation of Liver qi or uprising of Liver yang therefore easily lead to stiffness and pain of the neck and shoulders. If Liver fire or high fever consume Liver yin and generate wind there may be such acute spasmodic symptoms as opisthotonos, lockjaw, rigidity of the neck and spine and tetany. Gānshū BL-18 is indicated for all of these symptoms.

Finally the Illustrated Supplement to the Classic of Categories states that Gānshū BL-18 is one of five points (Fèishū BL-13, Xīnshū BL-15, Gānshū BL-18, Píshū BL-20 and Shènshū BL-23) which "drain heat from the five zang".
