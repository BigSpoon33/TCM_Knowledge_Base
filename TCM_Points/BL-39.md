## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

The Spiritual Pivot49 states "The he-sea points treat the internal fu". The three yang channels of the upper limb (Sanjiao, Large Intestine and Small Intestine) each have a he-sea point on their respective channel (TiƒÅnj«êng SJ-10, Q≈´ch√≠ L.I.-11 and Xi«éoh«éi SI-8). It is evident however, when one examines the indications for each of these points, that they have relatively little action on their related fu. This is not unexpected in view of the fact that whilst the channels are on the upper limb, in the case of the intestines, their associated fu are in the lower jiao. The same chapter of the Spiritual Pivot then goes on to rectify this contradiction by designating a lower he-sea point on the lower limb for each of the yang channels of the arm (Wƒõiy√°ng BL-39, Sh√†ngj√πx≈´ ST-37 and Xi√†j√πx≈´ ST-39 respectively).

Wƒõiy√°ng BL-39, as the lower he-sea point of the Sanjiao, has a specific action on the treatment of urinary disorders. The Spiritual Pivot50 emphasises the close relationship between the Sanjiao, the Kidneys and the Bladder, and states that there is a direct link between Wƒõiy√°ng BL-39 and the Bladder fu. According to the Essential Questions "The Sanjiao is the official in charge of drainage and controls the water passages"51, whilst the Ming dynasty classic Introduction to Medicine elaborated as follows "The lower jiao dominates moving and draining the urine and faeces, and at the right time discharging them ... therefore it is said the lower jiao is like a drain". The Spiritual Pivot says of Wƒõiy√°ng BL-39 "When excess there is retention of urine; when deficient there is enuresis; [when there is] enuresis, then reinforce, [when there is] retention then reduce"52 and "In diseases of the Sanjiao [there will be] fullness of the abdomen, hardness of the lower abdomen with inability to urinate causing extreme anguish, water will overflow and give rise to oedema and abdominal distention ... select Wƒõiy√°ng BL-39"53. As the lower he-sea point of the Sanjiao on the Bladder channel, Wƒõiy√°ng BL-39 specifically acts on the qi transforming action of the Bladder (ultimately controlled by the Kidneys) and hence is an important point in the treatment of retention of urine or difficult urination as well as enuresis.

An interesting classical indication for this point is axillary pain and swelling. This may be explained either by the pathway of the Bladder sinew channel, or more pertinently as a symptom of the Sanjiao channel.

Summary of clinical application
As the lower he-sea point of the Sanjiao is able to regulate urination: difficult urination, retention of urine, painful urinary dysfunction, enuresis.
‚ÄúIn diseases of the Sanjiao [there will be] fullness of the abdomen, hard ness of the lower abdomen with inability to urinate causing extreme anguish, water will overflow and give rise to oedema and abdominal distention ... select Weiyang BL‚Äë39‚Äù (Spiritual Pivot).
Also indicated for stiffness and pain of the lumbar spine, lumbar pain radiating to the abdomen, contraction and pain of the leg and foot, distention and fullness of the lower abdomen, haemorrhoids, constipation.
