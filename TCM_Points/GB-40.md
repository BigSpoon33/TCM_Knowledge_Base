## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

According to Chen Shi-dou "Only when the Liver acquires ming men is it able to plan strategies, only when the Gall Bladder acquires ming men are decisions made". The Liver and Gall Bladder are entrusted with the ministerial fire which corresponds to the energy of spring, growth, forcefulness and decision making. In disharmony, this indispensable fire is prone to flare up, principally when the Liver and Gall Bladder lose their free-flowing function and qi stagnates and transforms to fire. The fire is drawn into the Gall Bladder channel as a whole, and especially rises upwards to the head. Qiūxū GB-40, the yuan-source point of the Gall Bladder channel, is indicated when there is heat and stagnant qi in various portions of the Gall Bladder channel giving rise to distention, pain, redness or swelling of the head, eyes, neck, throat, axilla and abdomen, distention and pain of the chest and lateral costal region with sighing and inability to catch the breath, and shan disorder.

Qiūxū GB-40 is also indicated when heat and dampness combine, giving rise to such symptoms of damp-heat distressing the Gall Bladder fu or channel as cholecystitis and herpes zoster. If Liver and Gall Bladder heat or damp-heat transversely invade the Stomach, impairing its descending function, there may be vomiting and acid regurgitation.

Qiūxū GB-40 is able to treat disorders of the lower limb as a whole and is frequently employed in combination with points such as Jūliáo GB-29, Huántiào GB-30 and Yánglíngquán GB-34 in the 'chain and lock' point association method. It is specifically indicated for hip pain, sciatica, cramping and pain of the legs, atrophy disorder, painful obstruction (especially of the ankle joint), drop foot and flaccidity or swelling of the ankle. In the cross-needling method of point selection, the wrist joint in the upper body corresponds to the ankle joint in the lower body, and Qiūxū GB-40 is indicated by a number of classical texts for contralateral wrist pain.

According to both the Spiritual Pivot20 and the Essential Questions21 "Taiyang is the opening, yangming is the closing and shaoyang is the pivot". In the differentiation of fevers expounded in the Treatise on Injury by Cold by Zhang Zhong-jing, shaoyang syndrome represents the 'half-exterior half-interior' stage. The pathogenic factor resides between the taiyang and yangming levels and in this sense shaoyang is the pivot or hinge between the exterior and interior. Qiūxū GB-40 has long been used for chronic malaria, a classic example of a disease where the pathogenic factor enters the body and lodges at the half-exterior half-interior level. The alternating fever and chills reflect the battle between the correct qi and the pathogenic qi. When the correct qi predominates and is able to struggle with the pathogen, there is fever, and when the pathogenic qi predominates there are chills. Qiūxū GB-40, the yuan-source point of the foot shaoyang channel, is chosen to regulate the shaoyang channel and expel the pathogen, especially when chills predominate.

Summary of clinical application
Clears heat and stagnant qi from the Gall Bladder channel: distention, pain, redness or swelling of the head, eyes, neck, throat, axilla, chest, lateral costal region and abdomen; sighing,inability to catch the breath, shan disorder.
Clears damp-heat from the Gall-Bladder: cholecystitis, herpes zoster, vomiting, acid regurgitation.
For disorders the lower limb: hip pain, sciatica, cramp and pain of the legs, atrophy disorder, painful obstruction (especially of the ankle joint), drop foot, flaccidity or swelling of the ankle.
For chronic malaria.
