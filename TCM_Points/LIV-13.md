## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13, located midway between the middle and lower jiao, is both a point of the Liver channel and the front-mu point of the Spleen. The term 'mu' means to gather or to collect, and the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates on the anterior surface of the body. ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13 is therefore an important point to harmonise the relationship both between the Liver and Spleen, and between the middle and lower jiao, with the emphasis on disorders of the abdomen and intestines.

According to Standards of Patterns and Treatments "The essence of the five zang is all transported from the Spleen". As the origin of the post-natal qi, the Spleen and Stomach are considered to play a central role among the zangfu, transforming and distributing the essence of food and drink throughout the body. For this reason, the Spleen may be said to dominate the zang and the Stomach the fu. The close relationship of ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13 to the Spleen, therefore, is further reflected in its status as the hui-meeting point of the zang, in the same way that Zh≈çngw«én REN-12, the front-mu point of the Stomach, is also the hui-meeting point of the fu.

The Liver tends to excess patterns and the Spleen to deficiency. Liver-Spleen disharmony may originate either from the Liver, when qi stagnation aggressively invades, obstructs and suppresses the transportation and transformation function of the Spleen, or from the Spleen, when Spleen qi deficiency is unable to resist the encroachment of exuberant Liver qi. This process is reflected in the saying "Anger is hard and the zangfu are soft; what is hard easily injures what is soft" and by Zhang Jing-yue's observation "If anger occurs during or after eating it injures the Stomach and Spleen" 17. The origin of Liver-Spleen disharmony, therefore, may be either an excess condition of the Liver or a deficient condition of the Spleen, or a combination of the two. One characteristic of this disharmony is the fluctuation in severity of symptoms with changes in the emotional state, and the tendency for either Liver qi stagnation or Spleen deficiency to predominate at different times. ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13, which is able both to regulate the Liver qi and to tonify the Spleen, is the main point on the abdomen to treat all gradations of Liver-Spleen disharmony giving rise to symptoms such as propensity to anger, distention and pain of the abdomen, borborygmus, diarrhoea and loss of appetite. Diarrhoea due to Liver-Spleen disharmony is distinguished by two main characteristics. The first is that the diarrhoea is often preceded by distention and pain, both of which are relieved after passing stools. The second is that the diarrhoea frequently alternates with constipation, for which this point is also indicated. This pattern is frequently encountered in irritable bowel syndrome and premenstrual bowel disorders.

ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13 may also be used for Spleen disharmony without Liver complications, or Liver disharmony without Spleen complications. Through its action of fortifying the Spleen, it is indicated for weariness of the limbs, emaciation, injury to the Stomach and Spleen from overindulgence in eating, and diarrhoea containing undigested food. By resolving Liver qi stagnation it is able to treat oesophageal constriction, fullness of the chest, focal distention, pain of the lateral costal region and constipation. If Liver qi stagnation leads to stasis of blood, there may be abdominal masses and (in terms of western medicine) enlargement of the liver and/or spleen. If Liver qi stagnation transforms to fire, there may be agitation and heat with a dry mouth, mad walking and propensity to anger. If the Liver is deficient, there will be propensity to fear. If Liver qi invades the Stomach or Lung, and impairs their descending function, there will be vomiting, cough or dyspnoea. Through its dual action on the Liver and Spleen, ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13 is also able to drain dampness or damp-heat from the middle and lower jiao with such symptoms as jaundice and frequent urination with turbid white discharge.

The Liver channel is interiorly-exteriorly coupled with the Gall Bladder channel which controls the sides of the body and facilitates turning and bending. ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13, a meeting point of the Liver and Gall Bladder channels, is located close to the waist and lumbar region and is indicated for rigidity of the spine, lumbar pain and inability to turn and bend the waist. The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion recommends ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13 for cold and pain of the lumbar spine, whilst Sun Si-miao in the Thousand Ducat Formulas is more specific and recommends it for cold and painful lumbar spine in men.

Finally, ZhƒÅngm√©n LIV-13 is indicated for the pattern of running piglet qi arising from severe stagnation of qi. According to the Essentials From the Golden Cabinet "Running piglet disorder arises from the lower abdomen; it rushes up to the throat with such ferocity that the patient feels he is close to death. It attacks and then remits. It is brought about by fear and fright". Running piglet qi primarily arises when stagnant Liver qi transforms to heat, or when Kidney yang deficiency leads to accumulation of cold in the lower jiao. In both cases, qi is violently discharged and rushes upwards along the Penetrating vessel. In clinical practice, running piglet qi may be encountered in a number of variants, all involving a rushing sensation, usually upwards, along the trunk, back or limbs. It is usually accompanied by feelings of intense anxiety.
