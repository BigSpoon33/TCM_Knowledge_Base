## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Zhiyang DU-9 is located at the level of Geshu BL-17 (Diaphragm Shu). The diaphragm separates the middle and upper jiao, and Zhiyang DU-9 acts on both these areas. In fact an alternative name for this point is Feidi (Bottom of the Lung), again reflecting its location at the intersection of these two jiao.

In the middle jiao it is able to tonify and warm the Stomach and Spleen (cold in the Stomach, inability to eat, emaciation), as well as to drain dampness or damp-heat, especially of exterior origin (heaviness of the four limbs, and general malaise of the body). In modern clinical practice this point is much emphasised in the treatment of jaundice and was classically indicated for the five types of jaundice.

In the upper jiao it is able to unbind the chest (fullness of the chest and lateral costal region, cough and dyspnoea), and in common with many of the points of the Governing vessel is indicated for stiffness of the spine and lumbar pain.

Finally in the Essential Questions30 Zhiyang DU-9 is indicated for heat in the Kidneys. This indication clearly fell out of favour and was not mentioned in subsequent texts.

Summary of clinical application
Commonly used for jaundice.
For cold and deficient Stomach and Spleen (cold in the Stomach, inability to eat, emaciation, diminished qi difficulty in speaking) and dampness (heaviness of the four limbs).
Also for disorders of the upper jiao: fullness of the chest and lateral costal region, cough, dyspnoea.
