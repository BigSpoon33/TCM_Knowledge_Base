## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

Q√¨xu√© KID-13 (like S√¨m«én KID-14 and Zh≈çngzh√π KID-15) is an important point in the treatment of running piglet qi. According to Zhang Zhong-jing in the Essentials from the Golden Cabinet "Running piglet disorder arises from the lower abdomen; it rushes up to the throat with such ferocity that the patient feels he is close to death. It attacks and then remits. It is brought about by fear and fright". In the Classic of Difficulties26 running piglet was classified as one of the 'five accumulations' pertaining to the Kidneys. Running piglet qi primarily arises when stagnant Liver qi transforms to heat, or when Kidney yang deficiency leads to accumulation of cold in the lower jiao. In both cases, qi is violently discharged and rushes upwards along the Penetrating vessel. In clinical practice, running piglet qi may be encountered in a number of variants, all involving a rushing sensation, usually upwards, along the trunk, back or limbs. According to the Classic of Difficulties27 "When the Penetrating vessel is diseased there is counterflow qi". The application of Q√¨xu√© KID-13, S√¨m«én KID-14 and Zh≈çngzh√π KID-15 in the treatment of this distressing condition reflects both their location on the Kidney channel and their status as points of the Penetrating vessel, which both ascends through the abdomen to disperse in the chest, and enters the spine and circulates through the back.

Many classical sources list Baomen (Gate of the Uterus) and Zihu (Child's Door) as alternative names for this point. The Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas, however, is quite clear that these names correspond to Shu«êd√†o ST-28, referring to the points located 2 cun either side of GuƒÅnyu√°n REN-4.
