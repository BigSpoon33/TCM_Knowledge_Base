## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the (Classic of Difficulties4 ying-spring points are indicated for "heat in the body". The Sanjiao primary channel ascends: i. both posterior and anterior to the ear as well as entering the ear, ii. to the inferior aspect of the eye and the outer canthus, and iii. through the cheek. Yèmén SJ-2, the ying-spring and water point of the Sanjiao channel, is therefore able to clear heat from the upper reaches of the channel in the ears (deafness, tinnitus, earache), eyes (redness, dryness, lacrimation) and gums and teeth (pain and bleeding).

The Sanjiao is interiorly-exteriorly related to the Pericardium, the 'outer wrapping' of the Heart, and Yèmén SJ-2 is able to clear heat from the Heart and spirit manifesting as palpitations, fright, mania, raving and epilepsy.

In comparison with Guānchōng SJ-1, it is less effective in the treatment of febrile diseases and distal channel disorders affecting the shoulder and elbow, but more effective in calming the spirit and treating local channel disorders affecting the wrist, hand and fingers.

Summary of clinical application
Clears heat from the upper reaches of the channel in the ears (deafness, tinnitus, earache), eyes (redness, dryness, lacrimation) and gums and teeth (pain and bleeding).
Clears heat from the Heart and spirit manifesting as palpitations, fright, mania, raving and epilepsy.
Treats redness and swelling of the back of the hand, contraction of the five fingers, weakness of the wrist, neck pain and inability to raise the arm due to pain.
