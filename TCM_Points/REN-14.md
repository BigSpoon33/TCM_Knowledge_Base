## üß¨ TCM Theory & Commentary

According to the Essential Questions the front-mu points are where the qi of the zangfu gathers and concentrates, and J√πqu√® REN-14, the front-mu point of the Heart, is indicated for disorders both of the Heart zang and of the spirit. The Introduction to Medicine by Li Ting of the Ming dynasty states that J√πqu√® REN-14 treats the "nine types of Heart pain". According to the principles "without movement there is pain" and "where there is malnourishment there is pain", Heart pain always involves either stagnation of qi and blood or deficiency of qi, blood, yin or yang. In clinical practice such excess and deficiency patterns often combine, and even when the manifestation is excess (for example blood stasis or obstruction of blood by phlegm), the root may involve deficiency. Whatever the aetiology or pattern, as the front-mu point of the Heart J√πqu√® REN-14 is the principal local point for these disorders, particularly, according to many classical sources, when cold attacks the Heart. It is also indicated for chest pain, especially when it radiates to the back, a symptom of what is known as chest painful obstruction. This disorder, characterised by stasis of phlegm and blood and impaired circulation of yang qi, may also disrupt the function of the Lung resulting in cough and shortness of breath.

Any disharmony of the Heart may give rise to disturbance of the spirit, but the most serious occurs when phlegm obscures the portals of the Heart. In the context of the traditional indications for J√πqu√® REN-14, when phlegm alone predominates there may be poor memory, disorientation, loss of consciousness or epilepsy with vomiting of foam, whilst if phlegm combines with heat there will be various manifestations of mania disorder such as ranting and raving, great anger and fury, a tendency to curse and scold others etc. Alternatively, if i. Heart blood is deficient, ii. blood stasis hinders the proper nourishment of the Heart by fresh blood, or iii. either Heart yin deficiency or the transformation of blood stasis generate heat which agitates the spirit, there may be anxiety, palpitations and a nervous, agitated sensation in the pit of the epigastrium (below the Heart). J√πqu√® REN-14 is the principal local point for the treatment of these disorders.

The main pathway of the Conception vessel ascends from the perineum to the region of the mouth. Notwithstanding this upward movement of the channel, the points of the Conception vessel on the chest and abdomen have a strong action on descending qi, especially of the Lung and Stomach. This downward movement is reflected in the qigong 'small heavenly circuit' practice which ascends the qi through the Governing vessel and descends it through the Conception vessel. Located in the region between the Lung and Stomach, J√πqu√® REN-14 has a strong action on subduing rebellious qi in these two zangfu.

As far as the Lung is concerned, J√πqu√® REN-14 is indicated for rebellious qi manifesting as cough and fullness of the chest with shortness of breath. As for the Stomach, J√πqu√® REN-14 is able to regulate rebellion of qi manifesting as nausea, Stomach reflux, vomiting and acid regurgitation, and stagnation of qi giving rise to abdominal distention, oesophageal constriction, focal distention and obstruction of the diaphragm.

Finally the Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion recommends J√πqu√® REN-14 for mutual overacting of the five phases. This extremely broad indication is usually interpreted as a reflection of the status of the Heart, of which J√πqu√® REN-14 is the front-mu point, as the sovereign ruler of all the zangfu.
