## 🧬 TCM Theory & Commentary

According the Classic of Difficulties28 "When the Penetrating vessel is diseased there is counterflow qi and abdominal urgency". Like many of the Kidney channel points on the abdomen, Yōumén KID-21 (the final point of the Penetrating vessel on the Kidney channel) is indicated for counterflow qi manifesting as nausea, vomiting, retching and cough. The term abdominal urgency refers to a sensation of acute cramping pain, usually associated with dysenteric disorder.

Like the majority of the Penetrating vessel points on the Kidney channel, Yōumén KID-21 is indicated for redness of the eyes originating at the inner canthus. Whilst there is no simple explanation of this symptom, it is worth noting that although some descriptions of the Penetrating vessel suggest that it terminate at the lips, illustrations and other accounts of its pathway usually show it ending at the inner portion of the eyes.
