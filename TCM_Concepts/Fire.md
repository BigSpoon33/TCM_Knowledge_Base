# ðŸ§¬ Fire

## ðŸ“– Definition

Fire is a yang pathogenic factor caused by excess of yang qi. It often occurs in summer, but may be seen in other seasons.

---

## ðŸ”¬ Key Characteristics

### 1. Yang Nature & Upward Direction

Fire is a yang pathogenic factor characterized by burning and upward direction.

**Clinical Significance:** High fever, restlessness, thirst, sweating, mouth and tongue ulcers, swollen and painful gums, headache and congestion of the eyes. Restlessness, insomnia, mania, emotional excitement and coma or delirium may occur if pathogenic fire disturbs the mind.

### 2. Consumption of Yin Fluid

Pathogenic fire often consumes yin fluid. Burning pathogenic fire heat can consume yin fluid and force it to the exterior of the body, leading to insufficiency of body fluid.

**Clinical Significance:** High fever, thirst with desire to drink, dry lips and throat, constipation and deep-yellow scanty urine.

### 3. Stirring Wind and Disturbance of Blood

Invasion by fire stirs up wind and causes disturbance of blood. Excess of fire heat affects the Liver Meridian and deprives the tendons and meridian of nourishment, thus stirring up the liver wind. When pathogenic fire heat disturbs blood, it speeds up blood circulation and gives rise to very rapid pulse. In severe cases, blood is forced out of the vessels.

**Clinical Significance:** High fever, coma, convulsion of the four limbs, neck rigidity, opisthotonos and upward staring of the eyes (extreme heat stirring up wind). Very rapid pulse, epistaxis, spitting of blood, bloody stool, haematuria, uterine bleeding and menorrhagia. Pathogenic fire heat may stay in and rot the blood and flesh, thus creating carbuncle, furuncle, boil and ulcer.
