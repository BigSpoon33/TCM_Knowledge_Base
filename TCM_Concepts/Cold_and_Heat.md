## üî¨ Key Characteristics

### 1. Cold syndromes

Pathological conditions resulted from exposure to exogenous pathogenic cold or from deficiency of yang in the interior of the body.

**Clinical Significance:** Aversion to cold, preference for warmth, tastelessness in the mouth, absence of thirst, pallor, cold limbs, lying with the body curled up, loose stools, clear urine which is increased in volume, pale tongue, white and moist coating, slow or tense pulse.

### 2. Heat syndromes

Pathological conditions caused by invasion of exogenous pathogenic heat or by deficiency of yin in the interior of the body.

**Clinical Significance:** Fever, preference for coolness, thirst with preference for cold drinks, redness of face and eyes, irritability, restlessness, constipation, deep-yellow and scanty urine, red tongue with yellow and dry coating, and rapid pulse.

### 3. Complicated syndromes of cold and heat

The patient may have simultaneous signs of heat in the upper half of the body, and of cold in the lower half.  Examples are "heat above with cold below," cold on the exterior with heat in the interior, and heat on the exterior with cold in the interior.

**Clinical Significance:** "Heat above with cold below" manifests as suffocation and heat sensation in the chest and a frequent desire to vomit (heat above), whilst the "cold below" presents abdominal pain which can be alleviated by warmth, and loose stools.

### 4. Transformation of cold and heat syndromes - Cold to Heat

Cold syndrome occurs first and gradually changes into a heat syndrome.  Exposure to exogenous pathogenic cold may lead to an exterior cold syndrome, but if this pathogenic cold goes deep into the interior of the body and turns into heat, cold signs will subside and heat signs will occur.

**Clinical Significance:** Initial symptoms: fever, aversion to cold, general aching, no sweating, white tongue coating and superficial and tense pulse. Later symptoms: irritability, thirst and yellow tongue coating.

### 5. Transformation of cold and heat syndromes - Heat to Cold

Heat syndrome occurs first and gradually changes into a cold syndrome.

**Clinical Significance:** Abrupt appearance of cold limbs, pallor, and a deep and slow pulse in the patient with high fever, profuse sweating, thirst, irritability, and a surging and rapid pulse.

### 6. True heat with false cold

Syndrome in which there is heat in the interior of the body and false cold on the exterior. Excessive internal heat hinders the yang qi from reaching the exterior.

**Clinical Significance:** Cold limbs, burning sensation in the chest and abdomen, no aversion to cold, but aversion to heat, and a deep but forceful pulse. Thirst with preference for cold drinks, irritability, dry throat, foul breath, scanty, deep-yellow urine, constipation and a deep red tongue with yellow dry coating.

### 7. True cold with false heat

Syndrome in which there is real cold in the interior and false heat on the exterior. Excessive yin cold in the interior forces the yang qi to the exterior.

**Clinical Significance:** Feverishness of the body, flushed face, thirst and a superficial pulse. The patient wants to cover up the body in spite of the feverishness, wants to take warm drinks to relieve the thirst, and has a superficial and weak pulse. Other cold signs such as clear urine, loose stools and a pale tongue with white coating.
