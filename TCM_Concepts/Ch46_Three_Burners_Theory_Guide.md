### LEFT COLUMN

Identification of Patterns 
According to the Three Burners

Key contents

Upper Burner

Wind-Heat in the Lungs’ Defensive Qi portion
Heat in the Lungs (Qi level)
Heat in the Pericardium (Nutritive Qi level)

Middle Burner

Heat in Bright Yang
Damp-Heat in the Spleen

Lower Burner

Heat in the Kidneys
Liver-Heat stirs Wind
Liver Empty-Wind

The identification of patterns according to the Three 
Burners was formulated by Wu Ju Tong (1758–1836), 
author of ‘Systematic Differentiation of Warm Dis-
eases’ (Wen Bing Tiao Bian). The identification of pat-
terns according to the Three Burners classifies the 
clinical manifestations of febrile diseases from invasion 
of Wind-Heat according to the Three Burners: that is, 
according to their location rather than their energetic 
depth as the identification of patterns according to the 
Four Levels does.

However, the identification of patterns according to 
the Three Burners has many points in contact with 
that according to the Four Levels because the patterns 
of the Middle Burner are essentially the same as some 
of those of the Qi level and those of the Lower Burner 
are essentially the same as some of those of the Blood 
level. By contrast, the patterns of the Upper Burner 
occur at three levels: Defensive Qi, Qi and Nutritive Qi 
levels. The connections between the Four Levels, the 
Three Burners and the Six Stages were highlighted in 
chapter 45.

SECTION 3

PART 6

Clinical note

Wu Ju Tong formulated the widely used formula Yin Qiao San 
Lonicera–Forsythia Powder, the formula of choice for the 
beginning stage of invasions of Wind-Heat

The Three Burner patterns discussed are:

•	 Upper Burner

•	 Wind-Heat in the Lungs’ Defensive Qi portion
•	 Heat in the Lungs (Qi level)
•	 Heat in the Pericardium (Nutritive Qi level)
•	 Middle Burner

•	 Heat in Bright Yang
•	 Damp-Heat in the Spleen
•	 Lower Burner

•	 Heat in the Kidneys
•	 Liver-Heat stirs Wind
•	 Liver Empty-Wind

UPPER BURNER

Wind-Heat in the Lungs’ Defensive  
Qi portion

Clinical manifestations

Fever, aversion to cold, headache, sore throat, slight 
sweating, runny nose with yellow discharge, swollen 
tonsils, body aches, slight thirst, tongue Red in the 
front or sides with a thin white coating, Floating-Rapid 
pulse.

Pathology

The pathology of this pattern is the same as that for 
invasion of Wind-Heat at the Defensive Qi Level of the 
Four Levels. The tongue coating is white because the 
pathogenic factor is on the Exterior.
