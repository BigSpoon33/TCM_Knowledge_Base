# üß¨ Inspection

## üìñ Definition

Inspection is a diagnostic method where the doctor observes changes in a patient's vitality, color, appearance, secretions, and excretions to understand pathological changes in internal organs. It relies on the relationship between the external body (especially the face and tongue) and the zang-fu organs.

## üî¨ Key Characteristics

### 1. Observation of the Vitality

Vitality is the general manifestation of the vital activities of the human body, and the outward sign of relative strength of qi and blood of the zang-fu organs, which take essential qi as the basis. By observing vitality, one may get a rough idea of the strength of the antipathogenic qi of the human body and severity of the disease.

**Clinical Significance:** If the patient is fully conscious and in fairly good spirits, responds keenly with a sparkle in the eyes, the patient is vigorous and the disease is mild. If the patient is spiritless with dull eyes and sluggish response or even mental disturbance, the patient lacks vigour and the disease is severe.

### 2. Observation of the Colour

Both the colour and lustre of the face are observed. There are five discolorations, namely, blue, yellow, red, pale and dark grey. Observation of the lustre of the face is to distinguish whether the complexion is bright and moist or dark and haggard.

**Clinical Significance:** The colour and lustre of the face are the outward manifestations of the relative strength of qi and blood of the zang-fu organs. Their changes often suggest various pathological conditions. Observation of these changes is valuable for diagnosing disease.

### 3. Red Colour

A red colour often indicates heat syndromes, which may be of deficiency type or of excess type. When the entire face is red, it is a sign of a heat syndrome of excess type resulting from either exposure to exogenous pathogenic factors with the symptom of fever, or hyperactivity of yang of zang-fu organs. The presence of malar flush accompanied by tidal fever and night sweating suggests an interior heat syndrome due to yin deficiency.

### 4. Pale Colour

A pale colour indicates cold syndromes of deficiency type and loss of blood. A pale complexion is often due to yin excess or yang deficiency. A bright white face with a puffy, bloated appearance is a sign of deficiency of yang qi. If the pale face is withered, it signifies blood deficiency.

### 5. Yellow Colour

A yellow colour indicates syndromes of deficiency type and damp syndromes. When the entire body, including the face, eyes and skin, is yellow, it is jaundice. If the yellowness tends toward bright orange, it is called yang jaundice resulting from damp heat. If the yellow is smoky dark, it is called yin jaundice resulting from either cold damp or long-term stagnation of blood. A pale yellow complexion without brightness is a sign of deficiency of both qi and blood.

### 6. Blue Colour

A blue colour indicates cold syndromes, painful syndromes, stagnation of blood and convulsion. A pale complexion with a blue tinge is seen in a syndrome of excessive yin and cold with the symptom of severe pain in the epigastrium and abdomen. Blue purplish face and lips with the intermittent pain in the precordial region or behind the sternum are due to stagnation of the heart blood. Blue purplish face and lips accompanied by high fever and violent movement of the limbs in children are signs of infantile convulsion.

### 7. Dark Grey Colour

A dark grey colour indicates deficiency of the kidney and stagnation of blood. A pale and dark complexion accompanied with lumbar soreness and cold feet suggests insufficiency of the kidney yang. A dark complexion without brightness, accompanied by scaly skin signifies prolonged stagnation of blood.

### 8. Observation of the Appearance

Appearance refers to the body shape which can be described as strong, weak, heavy or skinny; and to the movement and posture related to disease.

**Clinical Significance:** Overweight with mental depression mostly suggests deficiency of qi and excess of phlegm damp. A thin person with dry skin indicates insufficiency of blood. Great loss of weight in the course of a long illness indicates the exhaustion of the essential qi.

### 9. Observation of the Five Sense Organs

Abnormal changes in the eye are not only associated with the liver, but also reflect the pathological changes of other zang-fu organs. 

**Clinical Significance:** Redness and swelling of the eye are often due to wind heat or liver fire. Yellow sclera suggests jaundice. Ulceration of the canthus denotes damp heat. Upward, straight forward or sideways staring of the eye is mostly caused by disturbance of liver wind.

### 10. Observation of the nose

Observe the appearance and discharge of the nose.

**Clinical Significance:** The flapping of the ala nasi is often present in asthmatic breathing due to either heat in the lung or deficiency of qi of both the lung and kidney. Clear nasal discharge is due to exposure to wind cold, whilst turbid nasal discharge to wind heat. Prolonged turbid nasal discharge with stinking smell suggests chronic rhinitis or chronic sinusitis.

### 11. Observation of the ear

Due attention is paid to the colour of the ear and conditions of the internal ear.

**Clinical Significance:** Dry and withered auricles, burnt black in colour, present in the patient with a prolonged or severe illness, are due to consumption of the kidney essence not allowing it to nourish upwards. Purulent discharge in the ear, known as ‚ÄúTin Er‚Äù (suppurative infection of the ear), is mostly caused by damp heat of the liver and gallbladder.

### 12. Observation of the gums

Observe the gums

**Clinical Significance:** Pale gums indicate deficiency of blood. Redness and swelling of the gums are due to flaring up of the stomach fire. If redness and swelling of the gums are accompanied by bleeding, it is due to injury of the vessels by the stomach fire.

### 13. Observation of the lips and mouth

Observe the changes of the lips and mouth in colour, moisture and appearance.

**Clinical Significance:** Pale lips denote deficiency of blood. Blue purplish lips suggest either retention of cold or stagnation of blood. Dry lips, deep red in colour, indicate excessive heat. Sudden collapse with open mouth is deficiency, whilst sudden collapse with lock jaw is excess.

### 14. Observation of the throat

The focus is on abnormal changes of the throat in colour and appearance.

**Clinical Significance:** Redness and swelling of the throat with soreness denote accumulation of heat in the lung and stomach. Redness and swelling of the throat with yellow or white ulcer spots are due to excessive toxic heat in the lung and stomach. A bright red throat with a mild soreness suggests yin deficiency leading to hyperactivity of fire. If there occurs a false membrane over the throat, which is greyish white in colour, hard to remove, bleeds following forceful rubbing and regrows immediately, it indicates diphtheria resulting from heat in the lung consuming yin.

### 15. Observation of the Tongue

The tongue directly or indirectly connects with many zang-fu organs through the meridians and collaterals. So the essential qi of the zang-fu organs can go upward to nourish the tongue, and pathological changes of the zang-fu organs can be reflected by changes in tongue conditions.

**Clinical Significance:** Observation of the tongue can determine the pathological changes of the internal organs.

### 16. Tongue Proper

Observe the colour and form of the tongue proper.

### 17. Pale Tongue

A pale tongue is less red than a normal tongue, and indicates syndromes of deficiency type and cold syndromes caused by deficiency of yang qi or insufficiency of qi and blood.

### 18. Red Tongue

A red tongue is bright red and redder than a normal tongue. It indicates various heat syndromes including interior heat syndromes of excess type and interior heat syndromes of deficiency type due to yin deficiency.

### 19. Deep Red Tongue

A deep red tongue indicates an extreme heat condition. In exogenous febrile diseases, it indicates invasion of the ying and xue (blood) systems by pathogenic heat. In endogenous diseases, it indicates yin deficiency leading to hyperactivity of fire.

### 20. Purple Tongue

A blue purple tongue indicates stagnation of blood which is related to either cold or heat. A deep blue purplish tongue, dry and lustreless, is related to heat, whilst a pale purplish and moist tongue is related to cold. The presence of purplish spots on the tongue surface also indicates stagnation of blood.

### 21. Swollen Tongue

A swollen tongue is larger than normal. If a swollen tongue is delicate in quality and pale in colour, and with tooth prints on the border, it indicates yang deficiency of the spleen and kidney. The condition is due to impaired circulation of body fluid producing harmful water, retained fluid, phlegm and damp. If a swollen tongue is deep red in colour occupying the entire space of the mouth, it indicates excessive heat in the heart and spleen. If a swollen tongue is blue purplish and dark, it indicates toxicosis.

### 22. Thin Tongue

A thin tongue is smaller and thinner than normal. A thin and pale tongue indicates deficiency of qi and blood. A thin, dry and deep red tongue indicates hyperactivity of fire due to deficiency of yin in which body fluid is consumed.

### 23. Cracked Tongue

Irregular streaks or cracks on the tongue indicate excessive heat consuming body fluid if the tongue is deep red in colour, and indicate deficiency of blood if the tongue is pale.

**Clinical Significance:** A cracked tongue may be present in a normal person. If so, the cracks are not deep, and remain there all the time unchanged. This is considered normal.

### 24. Thorny Tongue

The papillary buds over the surface of the tongue swell up like thorns. A thorny and red tongue indicates accumulation of pathogenic heat in the interior.

**Clinical Significance:** The more severe the pathogenic heat is, the more enlarged and profuse the thorns will be.

### 25. Deviated Tongue

A deviated tongue indicates windstroke or early threatening signs of windstroke.

### 26. Rigid Tongue

A rigid tongue lacks flexibility and is difficult to protrude, retract or roll. A rigid tongue seen in exogenous febrile diseases often indicates invasion of the pericardium by heat, retention of turbid phlegm in the interior, or excessive pathogenic heat consuming body fluid. A rigid tongue present in endogenous diseases indicates wind stroke or early threatening signs of windstroke.

### 27. Flaccid Tongue

A flaccid tongue is weak in motion, and often indicates extreme deficiency of qi and blood or consumption of yin fluid depriving the tongue of the nourishment. If a flaccid tongue is pale, it indicates deficiency of qi and blood. If it is deep red, it indicates collapse of yin.

### 28. Tongue Coating

Quality of the tongue coating

### 29. Thick Coating and Thin Coating

The tongue coating is considered thin if the tongue proper can indistinctly be seen through it, and considered thick if the tongue proper cannot be seen through it.

**Clinical Significance:** One can understand the severity of the pathogenic factors and progression of the pathological conditions by distinguishing the thickness and thinness of the tongue coating. Generally speaking, a thin tongue coating is present if the superficial portion of the body is affected in a disease, or if the disease is due to deficiency of the antipathogenic qi. Retention of damp, phlegm or food in the interior, or inward transmission of the pathogenic factor from the exterior may produce a thick tongue coating. Thickening coating indicates inward transmission of the pathogenic factor from the exterior, and is a sign of aggravation of the disease. Thinning coating points to gradual elimination of the pathogenic factor, and is a sign of alleviation of the pathological conditions.

### 30. Moist Coating and Dry Coating

One can understand the condition of the body fluid by distinguishing the moisture and dryness of the tongue coating.

**Clinical Significance:** A normal tongue coating is moist and lustrous, which is the manifestation of normal dissemination of the body fluid. A dry tongue coating, which looks coarse and feels lacking moisture indicates consumption of body fluid due to excessive heat or consumption of yin fluid not allowing it to nourish upwards. If there is excessive moisture over the tongue surface, and the saliva dribbles when the tongue is stuck out in a severe case, it is a slippery tongue coating. The condition is caused by upward flooding of harmful water and damp.

### 31. Sticky Coating and Granular Coating

Both sticky and granular tongue coating help deduce the turbid damp in the intestines and stomach.

**Clinical Significance:** It is a sticky coating if the tongue is covered by a turbid layer of fine greasy substance which is hard to be scrubbed. A sticky tongue coating is often seen in syndromes resulting from retention of turbid damp and phlegm or retention of food. It will be a granular coating if the granules on the tongue surface are coarse, loose and thick like residue of making soy bean curds, and easily scrubbed. A pasty tongue coating often results from excessive yang heat bringing the turbid qi in the stomach upwards. It is also seen in syndromes caused by retention of turbid phlegm or retention of food.

### 32. Peeled Coating

The tongue with a part of its coating peeling off is known as "geographic tongue."

**Clinical Significance:** It is a sign of consumption of qi and yin of the stomach. If the entire coating peels off leaving the surface mirror smooth, the condition is known as glossy tongue. It is a sign of exhaustion of the stomach yin and severe damage of the stomach qi.

### 33. White Coating

A thin and white coating is normal. Yet a white coating may appear in an illness. If so, it indicates exterior syndromes and cold syndromes.

**Clinical Significance:** A thin and white coating is present in exterior cold syndromes, whilst a thick and white coating is seen in interior cold syndromes.

### 34. Yellow Coating

A yellow coating indicates interior syndromes and heat syndromes.

**Clinical Significance:** The deeper yellow the coating is, the more severe pathogenic heat it indicates. A light yellow coating points to mild heat; a deep yellow coating to severe heat; a burnt yellow coating to accumulation of heat.

### 35. Grey Coating

A grey coating indicates interior syndromes, and may be seen in interior heat syndromes or syndromes resulting from cold and damp.

**Clinical Significance:** If a grey coating is yellowish and dry, it signifies consumption of body fluid due to excessive heat. If a grey coating is whitish and moist, it implies retention of cold damp in the interior or retention of phlegm and fluid. As a grey coating often develops into a black coating, a greyish black coating is seen.

### 36. Black Coating

A black coating indicates interior syndromes due to extreme heat or excessive cold. A black coating is often the outcome of the further development of a yellow coating or a grey coating. It is present at the severe stage of an illness.

**Clinical Significance:** If a black coating is yellowish and dry, possibly with thorns, it signifies consumption of body fluid due to extreme heat. A pale black and slippery coating implies excessive cold due to yang deficiency.
