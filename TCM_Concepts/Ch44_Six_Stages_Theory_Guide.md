The identification of patterns according to the Six 
Stages was formulated by Zhang Zhong Jing (ad 150–
219) in his celebrated book ‘Discussion of Cold-Induced 
Diseases’ ‘Shang Han Lun’ (c.ad 220). Although the 
‘Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine’ deals 
with the pathology and treatment of diseases of exte-
rior origin in several chapters, the ‘Discussion of Cold-
Induced Diseases’ was the first clinical manual to 
describe systematically the pathology and treatment of 
diseases caused by invasion of exterior pathogenic 
factors. However, the historical and clinical signifi-
cance of the ‘Discussion of Cold-Induced Diseases’ goes 
beyond the mere pathology and treatment of diseases 
caused by exterior pathogenic factors as many of the 
herbal formulae from this book are very important and 
frequently used in the clinic today.

Identification of Patterns 
According to the Six Stages

For centuries, the ‘Discussion of Cold-Induced Dis-
eases’ dominated Chinese medical thinking on diseases 
of exterior origin and, in consequence, in most cases 
these were attributed to invasion of Wind with Cold, 
although the book does describe patterns of Wind-Heat 
as well. Many centuries later, in the late Ming and espe-
cially early Qing dynasty, a new school of thought 
emerged which emphasized exterior Wind-Heat in  
the pathology and treatment of exterior diseases and 
such diseases were called Wen Bing, ‘Warm Diseases’ 
(see chs 45 and 46). The doctors who described  
the clinical manifestations and treatment of ‘Warm 
Diseases’ are referred to collectively as the ‘School of 
Warm Diseases’.

Although the term ‘Warm Disease’ (wen bing) appears 
already in the ‘Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal 
Medicine’ and in the ‘Discussion of Cold-Induced Dis-
eases’ itself, in these books it has a different meaning 
than the one it has in the School of Warm Diseases. 
The ‘Simple Questions’ (Su Wen) mentions diseases 
from exterior Heat in chapters 3, 5, 31, 32, 33, 71 and 
74 and the ‘Spiritual Axis’ (Ling Shu) in chapters 23 
and 74. Indeed, the ‘Simple Questions’ itself describes 
the clinical manifestations of the Six Stages (i.e. Greater 
Yang, Bright Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Yin, Lesser Yin 
and Terminal Yin), although with different symptoms 
than those in the ‘Discussion of Cold-Induced Dis-
eases’. However, as the medical thinking on diseases  
of exterior origin was dominated by the emphasis of 
exterior Cold as the main pathogenic factor, even dis-
eases characterized by Heat manifestations (called 
‘Warm Disease’) were explained as a transformation  
of Cold.

For example, chapter 3 of the ‘Simple Questions’ 
says: ‘If Cold attacks in Winter it will cause a Warm 
Disease in Spring’.1 Chapter 4 of the ‘Simple Questions’ 
says: ‘The Essence is the root of the body: if it is stored [in 
Winter], Warm Diseases will not occur in Spring.’2

### LEFT COLUMN

The ‘Classic of Difficulties’ (Nan Jing) says in  
chapter 58: ‘There are five types of injury from Cold: 
attack of Wind, attack of Cold, Damp-Warmth [shi wen], 
Heat disease and Warm disease [wen bing].’3

The ‘Discussion of Cold-Induced Diseases’ became 
such an authoritative text on the treatment of diseases 
of exterior origin that a rigid convention developed 
according to which ‘The method should not depart from 
the Shang Han [Lun]; the prescription should follow Zhong 
Jing.’4

Thus, the term ‘Injury from Cold’ (Shang Han) has 
two different meanings. In a broad sense, developed 
during the centuries following the time of Zhang 
Zhong Jing until the Song dynasty, shang han does not 
refer specifically to Cold but to exterior pathogenic 
factors in general. In a narrow sense, developed in the 
centuries after the Song dynasty, the term shang han 
refers to invasions of external Cold and it is a term that 
is contrasted to the term wen bing, which refers to inva-
sions of external Wind-Heat (Fig. 44.1).

The term shang han has yet another meaning. In the 
Greater Yang stage of invasion of Wind-Cold there is a 
further differentiation between prevalence of Cold (no 
sweating) called shang han, and prevalence of Wind 
(sweating) called zhong feng (Wind strike).

The concept and nature of ‘Wind’ as an exterior 
pathogenic factor has already been discussed in chap-
ters 21 and 43. The ‘Discussion on Cold-Induced  
Diseases’ describes two separate types of invasion of 
exterior pathogenic factors in the beginning stage, that 
is, an ‘attack of Wind’ (literally ‘Wind-strike’ zhong 
feng)5 and an ‘attack of Cold’ (literally ‘injury from 
Cold’ shang han). Essentially these two patterns describe 
the clinical manifestations arising from an invasion of 
external Wind with Cold (now called Wind-Cold), the

former with the emphasis on Wind, the latter with the 
emphasis on Cold.

The Six Stages described in the ‘Discussion on  
Cold-Induced Diseases’ are (Fig. 44.2):

Greater Yang stage (Tai Yang)

• Channel patterns

• Invasion of Wind-Cold with prevalence of Wind

(Zhong Feng)
• Invasion of Wind-Cold with prevalence of Cold

(Shang Han)
• Organ patterns

• Accumulation of Water
• Accumulation of Blood
Bright Yang stage (Yang Ming)

• Bright Yang channel pattern
• Bright Yang organ pattern
Lesser Yang stage (Shao Yang)
Greater Yin stage (Tai Yin)
Lesser Yin stage (Shao Yin)

• Cold transformation
• Heat transformation
Terminal Yin stage (Jue Yin)

The first stage, Greater Yang, is the beginning stage 
and the only exterior stage: at the Greater Yang stage, 
the exterior Wind is still on the Exterior of the body  
and the Internal Organs are not affected (although the 
Greater Yang stage does have two organ patterns as 
well). All the other stages are characterized by penetra-
tion of the pathogenic factor into the Interior, in the 
Bright Yang stage in the Yang and in the three Yin 
stages in the Yin. The Lesser Yang stage is somewhat 
different as it is characterized by the oscillation of  
the pathogenic factor between the Exterior and the 
Interior.

From Jin to Song dynasty: broad meaning of injury from
external pathogenic factors in general

From Song dynasty onwards: narrow meaning of injury from
Wind-Cold, as opposed to Wen Bing, injury from Wind-Heat

In the Defensive Qi (Wei) Stage of 6 Stages, invasion
of Wind-Cold: it refers to prevalence of Cold (no sweating)
as opposed to prevalence of Wind (sweating)

GREATER YANG STAGE

The first stage, Greater Yang, is the beginning stage and 
the only exterior stage: at the Greater Yang stage, the 
exterior Wind is still on the Exterior of the body and 
the Internal Organs are not affected (although the 
Greater Yang stage does have two organ patterns as 
well).

There are three essential symptoms of this stage, 
irrespective of the pattern (Fig. 44.3):

1. Aversion to cold
2. Headache and stiff neck
3. Floating pulse

Aversion to cold

This is caused by obstruction of the space between skin 
and muscles by exterior Wind and it has already been 
described above.

Headache and stiff neck

The headache is typically occipital. Wind contracts and 
stops movement, hence the stiff neck. External Wind 
obstructs the Greater Yang channels and this causes 
the typical occipital headache (i.e. along the Greater 
Yang channels, Small Intestine and Bladder).

Floating pulse

The Floating pulse feels very superficial and, indeed, 
‘floating’ under the finger; it is also relatively large. The

The three essential symptoms of external Wind invasion are:
1. Aversion to cold
2. Occipital headache and stiff neck
3. Floating pulse

Clinical manifestations

Pathology

This pattern is characterized by two features: there is 
an emphasis on Wind more than Cold and there is a

### RIGHT COLUMN

deficiency of Nutritive Qi (Ying Qi) compared to Defen-
sive Qi (Wei Qi).

Aversion to cold indicates a subjective feeling of cold 
experienced by the patient with sudden onset: this cold 
feeling is typically not alleviated by covering oneself. In 
fact, in severe cases, the patient may be lying in bed 
under several blankets and still be shivering. Aversion 
to cold is caused by the obstruction of the space 
between the skin and muscles by exterior Wind: this 
impairs the circulation of Defensive Qi in this space, 
which therefore cannot warm the muscles. In Attack 
of Wind (compared to Attack of Cold) the aversion to 
cold is mild; ‘aversion to wind’ is the same as ‘aversion 
to cold’ but milder.

‘Fever’ does not refer to an actual fever but to the 
objective hot feeling of the patient’s skin to palpation: 
the simultaneous occurrence of the subjective cold 
feeling ‘aversion to cold’ and ‘fever’ is typical of inva-
sions of exterior Wind. The ‘fever’ reflects the struggle 
between the exterior Wind and the body’s Qi. What I 
translate as ‘fever’ is called fa re: that is, ‘heat emission’ 
(see Glossary).

In Attack of Wind, the patient is sweating slightly 
because the deficient Nutritive Qi fails to hold sweat in 
the space between skin and muscles. The Attack of 
Wind pattern of the Greater Yang stage is character-
ized by a relative imbalance between the Defensive Qi 
and the Nutritive Qi, the former being ‘full’ and the 
latter ‘empty’. In Chinese, this situation is summarized 
in the expression ‘Defensive [Qi] strong, Nutritive [Qi] 
weak’ (Wei qiang, Ying ruo). In this case, the Defensive 
Qi is ‘strong’ only in relation to the Nutritive Qi, which 
is weak.

The occipital headache and stiff neck are caused by 
the obstruction of Qi in the Greater Yang channels of 
Small Intestine and Gall Bladder: as Wind naturally 
invades the upper part of the body, such obstruction 
manifests itself in the head and neck.

Sneezing is caused by the impairment of the diffus-
ing of Lung-Qi in the nose. The Floating pulse reflects 
the rush of Defensive Qi towards the surface of the 
body to fight the external Wind. The pulse is slow 
because Wind contracts and slows down.

Although both the Attack of Wind and Attack of 
Cold are Full conditions due to the presence of a patho-
genic factor, Attack of Wind is more Empty in relation 
to the Attack of Cold as in the former the Nutritive Qi 
is relatively weak.

Pathology

The aversion to cold, fever, headache, stiff neck, sneez-
ing and Floating pulse have already been explained 
above and the pathology is the same as in Attack  
of Wind.

A crucial difference between the Attack of Wind and 
Attack of Cold is that in the former there is a slight

sweating while in the latter there is no sweating. The 
lack of sweating in Attack of Cold reflects a more Full 
condition than in attack of Wind: that is, both Defen-
sive Qi and Nutritive Qi are in an Excess condition char-
acterized by the invasion of external Wind and by a 
‘tightness’ of the space between the skin and muscles. 
Cold contracts the pores, which therefore prevents 
sweating.

The runny nose with white discharge is due to the 
temporary impairment of the descending of Lung-Qi, 
which is unable to transform fluids in the Upper Burner 
and the nose specifically. Breathlessness is also due to 
the impairment of the descending of Lung-Qi.

The Tight quality of the pulse reflects Cold.

Treatment

Treatment principle: release the Exterior, expel Wind

and Cold, restore the diffusing and descending of 
Lung-Qi.

ORGAN PATTERNS

Accumulation of Water

Clinical manifestations

Aversion to cold, fever, retention of urine, slight thirst, 
vomiting of fluids soon after drinking, Floating-Rapid 
pulse.

Pathology

Although the Greater Yang is the beginning stage of an 
invasion of Wind characterized by the location of the 
pathogenic factor on the Exterior, it does have two 
organ patterns in which the pathogenic factors has 
penetrated in the Interior.

IDENTIFICATION OF PATTERNS

In the case of Accumulation of Water, the patho-
genic factor is in the Bladder organ while there are still 
symptoms of the Wind being on the Exterior: namely, 
aversion to cold, fever and Floating pulse.

The Bladder’s function of Qi transformation is 
impaired, Water is not transformed and this causes 
retention of urine, thirst and vomiting after drinking. 
The thirst is caused by the impairment of the Bladder’s 
separation of fluids and the Bladder’s fluids not ascend-
ing, not by a deficiency of fluids: for this reason, this 
thirst is not relieved by drinking and there is vomiting 
soon after drinking. No matter how much fluids one 
drinks, these accumulate in the Stomach and they 
cause vomiting soon after drinking.

Treatment

Treatment principle: release the Exterior, promote the

Bladder’s function of Qi transformation, promote 
the excretion of fluids.

Accumulation of Blood

Clinical manifestations

Hypogastric distension, fullness and urgency, blood  
in urine, mental restlessness, Reddish-Purple tongue 
without coating, Deep-Fine-Rapid or Deep-Choppy pulse.

Pathology

This pattern is characterized by accumulation of Heat 
and stasis in the Lower Burner and the Bladder organ. 
The stasis in the Bladder causes the hypogastric disten-
sion, fullness and urgency.

As the Bladder function is affected and the patho-
genic factor is at the Blood level, there is blood in the 
urine.

The Blood is the residence of the Mind: as there is 
Heat and stasis at the Blood level, there is mental rest-
lessness (what the ‘Discussion of Cold-Induced Dis-
eases’ literally calls ‘manic behaviour’ fa kuang).

Because of the Blood stasis, the blood vessels are 
obstructed and for this reason the pulse may be Choppy.

Treatment

Treatment principle: invigorate Blood, eliminate stasis

from the Lower Burner, clear Heat from the Bladder.

Identification of Patterns According to the Six Stages

Pathology

At the Bright Yang stage, the pathogenic factor has 
become interior and transformed into Heat. Therefore, 
from the Eight-Principle point of view, this pattern is 
interior Full-Hot. This pattern can develop from both 
the Greater Yang and the Lesser Yang stages.

There are two types of patterns at the Bright Yang 
stage: one characterized by Heat ‘without form’ (wu 
xing) and called ‘Bright Yang channel pattern’, the 
other characterized by Heat ‘with form’ (you xing) and 
called ‘Bright Yang organ pattern’. One could also  
say that the channel pattern is characterized by  
Heat, while the organ pattern is characterized by Fire 
(see below).

In the channel pattern there is Heat and, although 
this is interior, it is intense and projected towards the 
surface of the body: for this reason, it is cleared with 
pungent cold herbs which push the Heat outwards 
(the pungent taste has an outward, floating move-
ment). I use the term ‘clear Heat’ (xie re) for this action 
(see Glossary).

============================================================

============================================================

### LEFT COLUMN

This pattern is characterized by what are called the 
‘four bigs’: big thirst, big sweating, big fever and Big 
pulse. Intense Heat causes the thirst and sweating: the 
Heat is in the Stomach and, as this is the source of 
fluids, there is intense thirst. Unlike the Greater Yang 
stage, in this case, ‘fever’ does mean an actual fever 
caused by interior Heat: this is therefore an ‘interior 
fever’ while that at the Greater Yang stage is an ‘exte-
rior fever’. Besides the fever, there is also a pronounced 
feeling of heat and definitely no aversion to cold: indeed 
the disappearance of the aversion to cold and the onset 
of the aversion to heat heralds the change from the 
Greater Yang to the Bright Yang stage.

Pathology

This pattern is also characterized by interior Heat in 
the Stomach and Intestines. However, the Heat is more 
intense and it has injured the body fluids, leading to 
dryness. Some of the clinical manifestations are the 
same as in the Bright Yang channel pattern: that is, 
fever, feeling of heat, thirst and sweating.

As Heat (in this case called Fire) has injured the Body 
Fluids and led to dryness, there are dry stools and con-
stipation: the accumulation of dried-up faeces from 
constipation causes the abdominal fullness and pain. 
In this case, not only is Heat more intense (and there-
fore called Fire) but also it is more drying and at a 
deeper energetic level than the Heat of the Bright Yang 
channel pattern. For this reason, it cannot be expelled 
outward with pungent cold herbs but it must be con-
ducted downwards and expelled through the faeces by 
stimulating the bowel movement with bitter cold herbs. 
I call this treatment method ‘drain Fire’ (xie huo, 
bearing in mind that the ‘xie’ here is different than the 
‘xie’ in ‘clear Heat’; see Glossary).

The Deep pulse reflects the deeper location of Fire 
compared to Heat (in which the pulse was Overflowing 
or Big).

Treatment

Treatment principle: drain Fire from the Stomach and

Intestines, move downward.

LESSER YANG (SHAO YANG) STAGE

Clinical manifestations

Alternation of shivers (or cold feeling) and fever (or 
feeling of heat), bitter taste, dry throat, blurred vision, 
hypochondrial fullness and distension, no desire to eat 
or drink, irritability, nausea, vomiting, unilateral thin 
white coating, Wiry-Fine pulse (Fig. 44.6).

Pathology

In this pattern, the pathogenic factor ‘oscillates’ 
between the Greater Yang and the Bright Yang stages: 
when it goes towards the Greater Yang, the patient has 
aversion to cold (in the same way as in the Greater 
Yang stage); when it goes towards the Bright Yang, the 
patient feels hot or has a fever. For this reason, the 
Lesser Yang pattern is described as being ‘half interior 
and half exterior’: this does not mean that it is half 
interior and half exterior in character but that the

IDENTIFICATION OF PATTERNS

pathogenic factor oscillates (or ‘bounces’) between the 
Exterior (Greater Yang) and the Interior (Bright Yang).

It is important to note that the aversion to cold and 
feeling of heat alternate and are not simultaneous as in 
the Greater Yang pattern. Moreover, if there is no 
actual fever, the feeling of heat in the Lesser Yang 
pattern is a subjective feeling of heat, while the ‘heat 
emission’ of the Greater Yang pattern is an objective hot 
feeling of the patient’s body on palpation.

Other symptoms and signs are typical of the Gall 
Bladder channel: bitter taste, dry throat, blurred vision, 
hypochondrial fullness and distension, irritability, 
nausea and vomiting.

Typically, the tongue has a unilateral coating.

Treatment

Treatment principle: harmonize the Lesser Yang.

Pathology

The Greater Yin pattern is the first of the Yin patterns. 
It is characterized by Spleen-Yang deficiency with Cold. 
The obstruction of Cold in the abdomen causes abdom-
inal fullness and vomiting while the other symptoms 
are caused by Spleen-Yang deficiency.

From the Eight-Principle point of view, the pattern is 
interior Empty-Cold.

LESSER YIN (SHAO YIN) STAGE

The Lesser Yin stage has two patterns, called ‘Cold 
transformation’ and ‘Heat transformation’. These pat-
terns describe, respectively, essentially a deficiency of 
Kidney-Yang with Empty-Cold and one of Kidney-Yin 
with Empty-Heat.

Cold transformation

Clinical manifestations

Chills, feeling cold, lying with body curled, listlessness, 
desire to sleep, cold limbs, diarrhoea, no thirst, fre-
quent pale urination, Pale and wet tongue with white

Learning outcomes

In this chapter you will have learned:
• The historical context for identifying patterns according to

the Six Stages (especially Zhang Zhong Jing and his Shang 
Han Lun)
• The three essential symptoms of the Greater Yang stage of

external Wind invasion: aversion to cold, headache and stiff 
neck and a Floating pulse
• How to identify the following Greater Yang stage patterns:


### RIGHT COLUMN

Channel patterns

Invasion of Wind-Cold with a prevalence of Wind: slight sweating,

deficiency of Nutritive Qi, mild aversion to cold
Invasion of Wind-Cold with a prevalence of Cold: no sweating,

aversion to cold, Floating-Tight pulse

Organ patterns

Accumulation of Water: symptoms of Wind in the Exterior with

retention of urine, slight thirst and vomiting after drinking 
caused by the pathogenic factor in the Bladder
Accumulation of Blood: hypogastric fullness and urgency, blood

in urine, and mental restlessness caused by accumulation 
of Heat and stasis in the Lower Burner and Bladder
• How to identify the following Bright Yang stage patterns:

Bright Yang channel pattern: characterized by the ‘four bigs’:

big thirst, sweating, fever and pulse
Bright Yang organ pattern: fever, sweating, thirst, abdominal

fullness and constipation caused by more intense Heat 
at a deeper energetic level than the channel pattern (in 
Stomach and Intestines)
• How to identify the remaining Six-Stage patterns:

Lesser Yang: alternation of shivers and fever caused by

pathogenic factor oscillating between Greater Yang and 
Bright Yang stages, with Gall Bladder symptoms
Greater Yin: characterized by Spleen-Yang deficiency with

Cold (abdominal fullness, vomiting and feeling cold)
Lesser Yin Cold transformation: pathology of Kidney-Yang

deficiency with Cold (chills, frequent pale urination, pale 
and wet tongue with white coat)
Lesser Yin Heat transformation: pathology of Kidney-Yin

Identification of Patterns According to the Six Stages

deficiency with Empty-Heat (feeling of Heat, dry mouth 
and throat at night, night sweating, Red tongue without 
coating)
Terminal Yin: characterized by Heat above (thirst, feeling of

energy rising, pain and heat sensation in heart region, 
hunger) and Cold below (cold limbs, vomiting)

Self-assessment questions

pathology and treatment of diseases caused by invasion of 
exterior pathogenic factors? Who was the author and in 
which century was it written?
2. What are the three essential symptoms of a Greater Yang

stage invasion?
