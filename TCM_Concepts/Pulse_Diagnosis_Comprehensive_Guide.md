     INTRODUCTION
   Diagnosis by palpation includes palpation of the pulse, chest and abdomen,
various parts of the body, channels and points. The two most important parts of
diagnosis by palpation are the pulse and the abdomen.
   Pulse diagnosis developed to a very high level of sophistication in Chinese
medicine, benefiting from an unbroken continuous tradition for over 2000 years.
The first systematic elements of pulse diagnosis are found in the Yellow
Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine. It is possible that, in later centuries (from
the Song dynasty onwards) when Confucian morality prevailed, pulse diagnosis
was developed in preference to abdominal diagnosis as it was considered
improper for male physicians to palpate the body of women.
   Diagnosis by palpation of channels and points is very important especially
for acupuncturists as palpation and needling of tender points merges diagnosis
and therapy in one.

LIMITATIONS OF PULSE DIAGNOSIS

      It is subjective
      It is subject to short-term influences
     INTRODUCTION
   Pulse diagnosis is the most diﬃcult of the Chinese diagnostic arts: it is a very
complex subject which must involve a deep level of understanding and a great deal of
skill. An essential diagnostic tool for all practitioners of Chinese medicine, pulse
diagnosis is truly an ‘art'; it has more right to that title than any other of the Chinese
diagnostic skills. To acquire the skills of good pulse diagnosis requires great patience
and to become proficient takes years of practice. It is a study that has no end: one will
continue to develop one's skills and understanding of pulse diagnosis throughout a
lifetime of practice.
   What is one feeling when taking the pulse? Basically, we are feeling the pulsation
of Qi through the pulsation of Blood. Qi is a subtle energy and cannot be ‘felt' (except
by expert practitioners of Qi Gong) or ‘measured'; we therefore use the radial artery to
feel the pulsation of the blood to give us an idea of the state of Qi. This is made
possible by the strong link between Qi and Blood: Qi is the commander of Blood and
Blood is the mother of Qi. Thus, through the pulsation of Blood, we can feel the state
of Qi. That we use pulse diagnosis to feel the state of Qi is also shown by the fact that
the pulse is felt on the radial artery where the Lung channel flows; because the Lungs
govern Qi, that particular artery tells us about the state of Qi.
   Pulse diagnosis is important for two reasons: it helps to identify the internal organ
aﬀected or the prevailing pa ern and it reflects the whole complex of Qi and Blood.

     The pulse identifies organ and pattern disharmony
   Within the general picture of a disharmony, the pulse may be considered to be a
manifestation like any other (e.g. thirst, dizziness, red face, etc.). The unique
significance of pulse diagnosis, however, is that it, by itself, allows us to diagnose a
pa ern, even in the absence of other symptoms. For example, dizziness indicates a
Kidney deficiency only if it occurs together with other Kidney-deficiency symptoms,
such as tinnitus, lower backache and night sweating. However, a Deep-Weak Kidney
pulse on both Rear positions by itself unequivocally indicates a Kidney deficiency.
   In addition, the pulse may also indicate, by itself, a pa ern with some certainty.
For example, dizziness may be caused by Phlegm and, in order to diagnose this, it
should be accompanied by other symptoms or signs of Phlegm such as a feeling of
oppression in the chest, a feeling of muzziness in the head, a Swollen tongue, etc.
However, a Slippery pulse by itself indicates Phlegm (excluding of course the case of
pregnancy).

     The pulse gives us an idea of the state of Qi and Blood as a whole
   Another way in which the pulse diﬀers from other clinical manifestations is that it
gives a picture of the body as a whole, of the state of Qi and Blood, of the state of Yin
and Yang organs, of the state of parts of the body, and of the constitution of an
individual. No other clinical manifestation can do that and only the tongue comes
anywhere near so doing.
     THE ‘NINE REGIONS' OF THE PULSE FROM
THE ‘YELLOW EMPEROR'S CLASSIC OF
INTERNAL MEDICINE'
   The practice of feeling the pulse on the radial artery was described in the ‘Classic
of Diﬃculties' (c. AD 100); before that, the pulse was taken on nine diﬀerent arteries:
three in the head, three on the hands and three in the legs, as described in Chapter 20
of the ‘Simple Questions': ‘ There are three areas in the body, each area is divided into
three which makes nine regions: these are used to determine life and death [i.e.
prognosis], and in them, 100 diseases manifest, Deficiency and Excess are regulated
and the pathogenic factors can be expelled.' 1
   The ‘nine regions' are the arteries where the pulse is felt and which reflect the state
of the Upper, Middle and Lower Burners; each of these three areas is divided into
three regions identified with Heaven, Person and Earth to indicate Upper, Middle and
Lower regions as indicated in Table 49.1 .
   Table 49.1

   Although this method of taking the pulse on nine diﬀerent arteries and in nine
diﬀerent places was superseded by that of taking only the pulse of the radial artery,
feeling the pulses of the nine regions may still be useful in clinical practice to confirm
the Emptiness or Fullness of a particular area. For example, in a patient suﬀering from
hypertension caused by the rising of Liver-Yang, it may be useful to check the pulses
of the upper regions to determine the degree and severity of this pathology (the
stronger, harder and fuller the pulses of the upper regions, the more severe is the
rising of Liver-Yang).
   Another example of the use of the pulses of the nine regions is in patients with
circulatory problems in the legs; in this case, it may be useful to feel the pulses of the
lower regions to establish the degree of severity of this problem (the weaker and
emptier the pulses of the lower regions, the poorer is the circulation of Qi in the lower
legs). Furthermore, this method may be particularly important if taking the pulse of a
patient whose arm or leg has been amputated; in such a case the three pulses of the
radial artery of the missing limb may be replaced by the nine regions from the ‘Simple
Questions'.
     THE PULSE IN THE ‘CLASSIC OF
DIFFICULTIES'
   The ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' (AD 100) established for the first time the practice of
taking the pulse at the radial artery; this pulse was variously called Qi Kou (‘Portal of
Qi'), Cun Kou (‘Portal of Inch [Front pulse position]') and Mai Kou (‘Portal of Pulse').
The ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' says:
        The 12 main channels have their own arteries but the pulse can be taken only at the
    Portal of Inch [LU-9 position] reflecting the life and death of the 5 Yin and 6 Yang organs
    … The Portal of Inch is the beginning and end point of the energy of the 5 Yin and 6 Yang
    organs and that is why we can take the pulse at this position only. 2
   The last part of this statement is interesting since the description of the pulse of the
Portal of Inch as the ‘beginning and end point of the energy of the 5 Yin and 6 Yang
organs' seems to imply an understanding of the circulation of blood as a closed circuit.
   There are two main reasons why the pulse is felt at the ‘Qi Portal' position on the
radial artery by the wrist in correspondence with the Lung channel. First of all, the
Lungs govern Qi and this channel is therefore the best to gauge the state of Qi in the
body. In fact, Chapter 1 of the ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' says:
        Twelve channels have places where a pulse can be felt and yet one selects only the Inch
    Portal to determine the state of the 5 Yin and 6 Yang organs, why is this? The Inch Portal
    constitutes the great meeting place of the vessels, it is the place where the pulse of the
    Hand Greater Yin [Lungs] beats … the Inch Portal is the beginning and end of the 5 Yin
    and 6 Yang organs and therefore only the Inch Portal is used [for diagnosis]. 3
   Secondly, Postnatal Qi and Blood are derived from food and water entering the
Stomach. The Stomach extracts the essences of food, which go to the Lungs; from the
Lungs, they go to the skin and the five Yin and six Yang organs and to all the arteries
in the body; this is a reason why LU-9 Taiyuan is the Gathering point of all blood
vessels. The ‘Simple Questions' says in Chapter 11 :
        The Yellow Emperor asked: why is it that one can tell the state of the 5 Yin organs
    only from the Qi Portal? Chi Po replied: the Stomach is the Sea of Food and Drink and the
    great origin of the 6 Yang organs. The five flavours enter the mouth and are stored in the
    Stomach which nourishes the Qi of the 5 Yin organs; the Qi Portal is the Greater Yin. The
    flavours of the 5 Yin and 6 Yang organs are all derived from the Stomach and then
    transformed to become visible at the Qi Portal. 4
   Chapter 21 of the same text says:
        The Qi of food enters the Stomach, Food-Qi goes to the Heart and its refined part
    enters the vessels, the Qi of the vessels flows into the 12 channels and the Qi of the
    channels reaches the Lungs. The Lungs govern all vessels and their refined essence goes to
    the skin and body hair. The body hair and vessels combine together and Qi is transmi ed
    to the 6 Yang organs whose Qi is manifested and nourishes the four Yin organs [apart
    from the Heart]. When Qi is in balance, the Qi Portal becomes the Inch Portal [i.e. the
    pulse position] from which the state of the body can be determined. 5
   Thus, the section of radial artery on the Lung channel can tell us about the state of
Qi and Blood of the whole body (Box 49.1 ).
                      BOX 49.1          WHY THE PULSE IS FELT ON THE
              RADIAL ARTERY (LUNG CHANNEL)
                   • The Lungs govern Qi
                   • The Lungs receive the Food-Qi from the Stomach
      Dr J. H. F. Shen has an interesting further idea why the pulse is felt at the radial
artery by the wrist. He compares the blood flowing in the radial artery by the wrist
with a sea wave and the metacarpal bone of the thumb with a cliﬀ: because the wave
of blood in the radial artery crashes against the cliﬀ and is pushed back, we can feel
the pulse here. If the blood did not encounter this obstacle, it would flow through
undeflected and we would not be able to interpret it in the same way (Fig. 49.1 ).

              FIG. 49.1   The radial artery pulse according to Dr Shen

         THE THREE SECTIONS OF THE PULSE
      The three pulse sections are as follows:

Inch (Cun )    Front
Gate (Guan ) Middle
Foot (Chi )    Rear

      The second chapter of the ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' explains how its author arrived at
feeling the pulse at the three positions called Inch or Front, Gate or Middle and Foot
or Rear (Cun, Guan and Chi):
                The Foot and Inch sections of the pulse are the meeting point of the channels. The
        distance from the Gate position [LU-8, level with the radial apophysis] to the Foot position
        in the elbow represents the Foot-Interior and it reflects the Yin energies. The distance
        from the Gate position to the point Fish Margin [the thenar eminence] is the Foot-Exterior
        and it reflects the Yang energies. Hence, the distance of 1 inch is separated from the
        distance of 1 foot [from the Gate position to the elbow crease], so that the distance of 1 foot
        is represented by 1 inch. Hence the Yin energies are reflected within that 1-inch section of
        the foot-long section and the Yang energies are reflected within a 9-fen [nine-tenths of an
        inch] section of the Inch section. The total length of the Foot and Inch section extends over
        1 inch and 9 fen; hence one speaks of Foot and Inch sections. 6
      In other words, the distance from the Gate-Guan (or Middle) position of the pulse
(on LU-8 Jingqu) to the crease of the elbow measures one Chinese foot and reflects the
Yin energies; the distance from the Gate-Guan position to the crease of the wrist is 9
fen (nine-tenths of an inch) and reflects the Yang energies. However, a 1-inch section is
separated from the 1-foot distance from the Gate-Guan position to the elbow crease to
represent the Yin energies; in other words, this 1-inch section is representative of the
1-foot section (Fig. 49.2 ).
                                                                        Gate (LU- 8)

                                    Radial artery
      FIG. 49.2   Inch, Gate and Foot pulse sections from the ‘Classic of Difficulties'
   The ‘Pulse Classic' says something similar:
        From the Fish Margin [the thenar eminence] to the prominent bone [the radial styloid
     process] moving one inch backwards [proximally], in the middle of this is the Inch Portal.
     From the Inch to the Foot, it is called Chi Ze and this position is called Foot. The position
     behind the Inch and in front of the Foot positions, is called Gate position: this is the
     boundary between the emerging Yang [at the Inch position] and submerging Yin [at the
     Foot position]. Emerging Yang occupies three divisions [positions] and submerging Yin
     also occupies three divisions [positions]. Yang originates at the Foot position and moves
     [or manifests] in the Inch position; Yin originates in the Inch position and moves [or
     manifests] in the Foot position. The Inch position governs the Upper Burner including the
     skin and hair up to the hands; the Gate position governs the Middle Burner including the
     abdomen and back; the Foot position governs the Lower Burner including the lower
     abdomen up to the feet. 7
   The ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' says in Chapter 3 : ‘ In front [i.e. distal] of the Gate
position Yang moves, the pulse here is 9 fen long and superficial … behind [i.e.
proximal to] the Gate position Yin moves, the pulse here is 1 cun long and is deep. '. 8
   Thus, three sections of the pulse are identified: the Inch-Cun (Front) section
reflecting the Yang energies, and the Gate-Guan (Middle) section and the Foot-Chi
(Rear) section reflecting the Yin energies, (Box 49.2 ).

           BOX 49.2             THE THREE POSITIONS OF THE
      PULSE
          • The Inch-Cun (Front) position reflects the Yang energies
          • The Gate-Guan (Middle) and Foot-Chi (Rear) positions reflect the
      Yin energies
   Three diﬀerent types of finger pressure are applied to each section, making up the
‘nine regions', which share the same name with but have a diﬀerent meaning from
those of the ‘Simple Questions' listed above. This was the revolution brought to pulse
diagnosis by the ‘Classic of Diﬃculties': the same information that could be gained by
feeling the pulse on nine separate arteries in the head, hands and legs, could now be
gained by feeling the pulse at the radial artery only.
   Chapter 18 of the ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' describes the three diﬀerent pressures
applied to the pulse:
        There are three sections, Inch, Gate and Foot, and three pressures, superficial, middle
    and deep [which makes] 9 regions. The Upper section pertains to Heaven and reflects
    diseases from the chest to the head; the Middle section pertains to Person and reflects
    diseases from the dia-phragm to the umbilicus; the Lower section pertains to Earth and
    reflects diseases from the umbilicus to the feet. [One must] examine [these sections] before
    needling. 9
   This passage establishes clearly the principle, adopted by all successive doctors,
that the Inch section of the pulse corresponds to the Upper Burner and diseases from
the chest upwards, the Gate section to the Middle Burner and diseases from the
diaphragm tothe umbilicus, and the Foot section to the Lower Burner and diseases
from the umbilicus to the feet (Fig. 49.3 ).

  ASSIGNMENT OF PULSE POSITIONS TO
ORGANS
   I shall discuss the assignment of pulse positions to organs by examining the
various pulse arrangements over the ages, and then trying to reconcile the
discrepancies between the various arrangements.

     Organ Positions On The Pulse
   Besides a ributing the three sections of the pulse to the Three Burners, Chinese
pulse diagnosis goes much further in assigning each pulse position to the Qi of a
particular organ. Through the centuries, Chinese doctors have disagreed over such
assignment and many diﬀerent opinions exist. Table 49.2 summarizes the assignment
of pulse positions to various organs, according to six representative major classics:

   It is worth reporting the actual passages concerning the correlation between organs
and pulse positions from some of the classics to show how such correlation has never
been so simple and mechanical as what tends to be taught today, that is, that we feel
the ‘Yang organs at the superficial level and Yin organs at the deep level'.

     Classic of Difficulties (Nan Jing , AD 100)
   Chapter 18 of the ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' explains the correspondence of pulse
positions to organs (or channels) in accordance with the five Elements in a rather
complex statement:
        The Hand Greater Yin [Lungs] and the Hand Bright Yang [Large Intestine] pertain to
    Metal; the Foot Lesser Yin [Kidneys] and Foot Greater Yang [Bladder] pertain to Water.
    Metal generates Water, Water flows downwards and cannot ascend. Therefore, these are
    felt at the position below the Gate position [i.e. Foot position]. The Foot Terminal Yin
    [Liver] and the Foot Lesser Yang [Gall-Bladder] pertain to Wood; Wood generates the Fire
    of the Hand Greater Yang [Small Intestine] and Hand Lesser Yin [Heart]. Fire blazes
    upwards and cannot descend. Hence, the Hand Greater Yang [Small Intestine] and Hand
    Lesser Yin [Heart] correspond to the position above the Gate [i.e. the Inch position]. The
    Fire of the Hand Heart Master [i.e. Pericardium] and Lesser Yang [Triple Burner]
    generates the Earth of Foot Greater Yin [Spleen] and Foot Bright Yang [Stomach], Earth
    governs the Centre and its position is therefore the central one. This is in accordance with
    the Five-Element Mother-Child mutual generating and nourishing relationship. 10
   Thus, the ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' assignment of organs to pulse positions follows
strictly the Generating cycle of the Five Elements as follows (Fig. 49.4 ):
                                                 (a)

                                                       I   ~u

Left                 Right
Small Intestine/Heart Lungs/Large Intestine
Gall-Bladder/Liver   Spleen/Stomach
Bladder/Kidneys      Pericardium/Triple Burner

       It is interesting to note that this strict assignment of organs to pulse positions
according to the Five Elements and the assignment of the right Foot (Rear) position to
the Pericardium and Triple Burner would suggest that the ‘Classic of Diﬃculties'
assigns channels rather than organs to the pulse positions. Thus, the arrangement of
pulse positions in the ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' is seen clearly from the acupuncturist's
perspective rather than the herbalist's and this would confirm that the two main pulse
arrangements, that is, one with the Small Intestine and Large Intestine on the Front
and the other with them on the Rear position, reflect the diﬀerent perspectives of the
acupuncturist and herbalist, as discussed in more detail below.

        Pulse Classic (Mai Jing, AD 280)
       The ‘Pulse Classic' discusses the correspondence of pulse positions to organs (or
channels) in Chapter 7 . It says:
               The Heart position is assigned to the left Cun [which is] distal to the Gate position.
        The Heart is the Hand Lesser Yin and is exteriorly-interiorly related to the Hand Great
        Yang, i.e. the Small Intestine. The Liver position is assigned to the left gate position. The
        Liver is the Foot Terminal Yin and is exteriorly-interiorly related to the Foot Lesser Yang,
        i.e. the Gall-Bladder. The Kidneys position is assigned to the left Foot position which is
        proximal to the Gate position. The Kidneys are the Foot Lesser Yin which is exteriorly-
        interiorly related with the Foot Greater Yang, i.e. the Bladder. The Lungs position is
        assigned to the right Cun position, distal to the Gate position. The Lungs are the Hand
        Greater Yin and are exteriorly-interiorly related to the Hand Bright Yang, i.e. the Large
        Intestine. The Spleen position is assigned to the right Guan position. The Spleen is the
        Foot Greater Yin which is exteriorly-interiorly related to the Foot Bright Yang, i.e. the
        Stomach. The Kidneys position is assigned to the right Foot position, proximal to the Gate
        position. The Kidneys are the Foot Lesser Yin which is exteriorly-interiorly related to the
        Foot Greater Yang, i.e. the Bladder. The Kidneys and Bladder meet in the Lower Burner at
        a point to the right of Guan Yuan [Ren-4]: to the left of this point are the Kidneys, to the
        right the Uterus also called Triple Burner. 11
       The last part of this statement is of note as it seems to assign both left and right
Rear positions to the Kidneys and Bladder, while the Rear position reflects also the
Uterus and Triple Burner. Most authors translate the end of the above passage as
meaning that the left Rear position corresponds to the Kidneys and the right Rear one
to the Uterus and Triple Burner; I personally think that ‘right' and ‘left' at the end of
the above passage refer to right and left of Ren-4 Guanyuan. In conclusion, the pulse
arrangement from the ‘Pulse Classic' is:

Left                    Right
Small Intestine/Heart Lungs/Large Intestine
Gall-Bladder/Liver      Spleen/Stomach
Bladder/Kidneys         Kidneys/Uterus/Triple Burner/Bladder

       The association between Uterus and Triple Burner is interesting as it confirms the
statement from Chapter 66 of the ‘Classic of Diﬃculties', according to which the
Original Qi stems from the space between the two kidneys (and therefore also the
Uterus in women) and it spreads to the five Yin and six Yang organs via the
intermediary of the Triple Burner.

         The ‘Study of the Pulse from Pin Hu Lake' (Pin Hu Mai Xue , 1564)
       The ‘Study of the Pulse from Pin Hu Lake' assigns only the Yin organs to the pulse
positions:
               ‘The Heart and Liver are on the left and Lungs and Spleen on the right. The Kidneys
        and Gate of life [Ming Men] are at the Foot position on left and right.' 12

         The ‘Golden Mirror of Medicine' (Yi Zong Jin Jian , 1742)
       The ‘Golden Mirror of Medicine' by Wu Qian assigns the pulse positions to the
organs as follows:

Left                              Right
‘External'/‘Internal'             ‘Internal'/‘External'
Shanzhong/Heart                   Lungs/Centre of thorax

Bladder, Small Intestine/Kidneys Kidneys/Large Intestine

           FIG. 49.6      Translation of pulse diagram from the ‘Golden Mirror of Medicine'
       The diagram from the ‘Golden Mirror of Medicine' clearly shows that ‘external'
and ‘internal' mean distal and proximal respectively: this means that the Yang and Yin
organs within each position are felt at the distal and proximal ends respectively. This
is discussed in greater depth below.

         Modern China
       The most common pulse assignment in modern China is as follows:

Left                              Right
‘External'/‘Internal'             ‘Internal'/‘External'
Pericardium/Heart                 Lungs
Gall-Bladder/Liver                Spleen/Stomach
Small Intestine/Bladder/Kidney-Yin Kidney-Yang/Large Intestine
    Such assignment of pulse positions to organs is something that I have deduced
from the various teachers I learned with in China as modern books do not usually
present this information in a clear form. This is probably due to the fact that there has
been considerable disagreement on this over the centuries and modern books tend
therefore to gloss over this. For example, ‘Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion' of
1987 does not even give any assignment of pulse positions to organs. 14 Other texts
often overlook the assignment of the Small and Large Intestine organs as this is the
subject of more disagreement: for exam-ple, the ‘Fundamentals of Chinese Medicine'
(a translation of a Chinese text) of 1985 says: ‘ The right Inch pulse is associated with
the Lungs, and the right Barrier pulse is associated with the Stomach and Spleen. The
left Inch pulse is associated with the Heart, and the left Barrier pulse is associated
with the Liver and Gall-Bladder. The Kidney and Bladder are reflected in both Cubit
pulses. ' 15

     Reconciling Different Pulse Arrangements
    Although diﬀerent pulse assignments may seem contradictory, there is a common
thread running through them. It is generally agreed that the Front position reflects the
Upper Burner, the Middle position the Middle Burner and the Rear position the
Lower Burner. Generally, the main discrepancies occur with the assignment of the
Yang organs and especially the Small and Large Intestine. Indeed, many doctors do
not assign the Yang organs to the pulse at all (the ‘Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal
Medicine' does not).

     Yin and Yang organ as reflected on the pulse
    The commonly held assumption that the superficial level reflects the state of the
Yang organs and the deep level that of the Yin organs has never been the only one in
Chinese medicine. In fact, the diﬀerent levels (or diﬀerent places) where the Yang and
Yin organs are felt are often described as wai (external) and nei (internal) and ‘external'
and ‘internal' may be interpreted in three ways:

           • ‘external' meaning superficial and ‘internal' meaning deep level
           • ‘external' meaning lateral and ‘internal' meaning medial
           • ‘external' meaning distal and ‘internal' meaning proximal.
    The first interpretation is by far the most common today but it is important to
realize that it is not the only one and also that the three interpretations are not
mutually exclusive. Indeed, Dr J. H. F. Shen often uses the second and third
interpretations when reading the pulse; this will be discussed later. Figure 49.7
illustrates the three diﬀerent ways of interpreting ‘external' and ‘internal'.
                                                                                 En em all

      FIG. 49.7   Meanings of ‘external' and ‘internal' in pulse taking
   In any case, the relationship between Yin and Yang organs as reflected on the pulse
needs to be interpreted dynamically and not mechanically; we should not simply
assign the superficial level to the Yang organs and the deep level to the Yin ones, for
example on the left Middle position the Gall-Bladder on the superficial level and the
Liver on the deep level. As the relationship between the paired Yin and Yang organs is
very close (except for the Small Intestine/Heart and Large Intestine/Lung, which will
be discussed shortly), each individual pulse position should be first analysed as a
whole, paying a ention to the intensity and the level of the pulse, rather than
mechanically feeling the ‘Gall-Bladder' on the superficial level and the ‘Liver' on the
deep level as two separate entities.
   Each pulse position can reflect diﬀerent phenomena in diﬀerent situations. For
example, let us consider the left Middle position (Liver and Gall-Bladder): in a state of
health, the Liver and Gall-Bladder will be balanced or, to put it diﬀerently, Yin and
Yang within the Liver/Gall-Bladder sphere are balanced. In this case, the pulse will be
relatively soft and smooth and not particularly superficial or deep and the Gall-
Bladder influence on the pulse will not be felt. But if Liver-Yang is in excess and rises
upwards aﬀecting the Gall-Bladder channel (causing severe temporal headaches), the
rising Qi will be reflected on the pulse, which will be Wiry (harder than normal) and
more superficial (it will be felt pounding under the finger). In interpreting this pulse
we can say that Liver-Yang is rising or, to put it diﬀerently, that the Gall-Bladder Qi is
in excess.

    The acupuncturist's and herbalist's perspectives in pulse
diagnosis
   One of the possible explanations for the diﬀerent pulse arrangements is the
therapeutic approach of the practitioner, that is, the acupuncturist or the herbalist.
Given that the pulse reflects the Qi of both organ and channel, acupuncturists working
on the channels would naturally assign the Small Intestine and Large Intestine to the
same positions as the Heart and Lungs respectively to which their channels are paired.
Herbalists, on the contrary, would give more importance to the Internal Organs rather
than the channels and therefore assign the Small and Large Intestine to the Rear
positions, that is, the Lower Burner where their organs are located.

    Small and Large Intestine channels versus organs in pulse
diagnosis
   The Small and Large Intestine are probably the subject of the widest discrepancies
in pulse diagnosis because they are sometimes placed on the Front and sometimes on
the Rear position. This discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the connection
between these two organs and their channels is somewhat looser than that of other
organs. In fact, the Small and Large Intestine organs are in the Lower Burner while
their channels are in the arms (the organs of the Upper Burner have their channels in
the arm, whereas the organs of the Middle and Lower Burner have their channels in
the legs). Furthermore, the functions of the intestinal organs do not correspond closely
to those of their channels; in fact, although the arm points of the Small and Large
Intestine can of course be used for intestinal problems, their chief clinical application
is to treat problems of the neck, shoulders, face and head as well as external invasions
of Wind.
   Thus, the same pulse quality in the specific example of the Front position could
mean two diﬀerent things in diﬀerent situations. For example, if the right Front
position (Lung) is quite superficial, slightly big and slightly Rapid, this could indicate
an emotional upset aﬀecting the Lungs. Here, the pulse reflects the state of the Lungs.
But on another occasion exactly the same type of pulse may indicate something quite
diﬀerent when, for example, the patient has an acute, large, purulent tooth abscess. In
such a case, the pulse reflects the state of the Large Intestine channel (where the
abscess is) rather than a problem with the Lung organ. On the other hand, problems
with the Large Intestine organ (rather than channel) more often manifest on the Rear
position of the pulse and often on both sides. For example, in patients suﬀering from
ulcerative colitis nearly always the Rear position of both sides is very Wiry, reflecting
the Heat and stagnation in the Large Intestine. Thus, from these two examples (tooth
abscess and ulcerative colitis) we can see how the contradictory assignments of the
Large Intestine to the right Front and right Rear positions can both be right.

   Clinical significance of pulse diagnosis irrespective of organ
positions
   We should not make too much of the diﬀerent pulse positions assumed by
diﬀerent doctors and we should not view the relationship between pulse positions
and organs mechanically. In fact, it would be perfectly possible to make a good,
clinically significant pulse diagnosis without referring to the Internal Organs at all.
This is because the pulse gives us an idea of the relative strength of Qi in the Three
Burners, at the three levels and on left and right sides.
   The pulse essentially reflects the state of Qi in the diﬀerent Burners and at diﬀerent
energetic levels which are dependent on the pathological condition. We need to
interpret the pulse dynamically rather than mechanically. The most important thing is
to appraise how Qi is flowing, what is the relationship between Yin and Yang on the
pulse (i.e. is there Deficiency or Excess of Yin or Yang), at what level is Qi flowing (i.e.
is the pulse superficial or deep), and whether the body's Qi is deficient and whether
there is an a ack by an external pathogenic factor.

         The pulse gives us clinically relevant information, even without
      reference to organ positions.

   Clinical interpretation of the pulse in acute versus chronic
conditions
   The clinical relevance of the assignment of pulse positions to organs diﬀers in
acute and chronic conditions. In acute conditions, especially in fevers, after operations,
during infections, etc., the assessment of the individual pulse positions is somewhat
less important than that of its overall quality and rate. For example, if a person suﬀers
a severe invasion of Wind, the pulse will be Floating in all the positions and, of course,
this does not indicate a pathology in each of the organs corresponding to those
positions.

     The pulse as a reflection of Heart-Qi
   Although each pulse position can be assigned to a particular Internal Organ or
channel, we should not lose sight of the fact that the pulse as a whole reflects the state
of Heart-Qi and Heart-Blood: the Heart governs Blood and the blood vessels and it is
therefore natural that a disharmony of the Heart may reflect on the pulse as a whole .
The influence of the Heart on the pulse as a whole is particularly manifest when the
pulse is extremely Weak, Fine or Choppy, or, conversely, Overflowing, in all positions,
and also when it is very Slow or very Rapid.
   Furthermore, any irregularity of the pulse (Kno ed, Hasty, Hurried, Intermi ent)
always indicates a Heart disharmony, whatever the other Internal Organs that may be
involved. Frequently, but by no means always, the above pulse qualities may indicate
not only a Heart disharmony in the Chinese sense, but possibly also a heart problem
in a Western sense. For example, a congenital heart defect may manifest with one of
the above qualities.
   The clinical significance of pulse diagnosis in heart problems is discussed further
below.

         Independently of positions, the pulse as a whole reflects Heart-Qi.

     THE THREE LEVELS
   When feeling the pulse one should apply three diﬀerent pressures to feel three
diﬀerent levels of energy: the superficial level is felt with a very light pressure and
corresponds to Qi, Yang and the Yang organs, the deep level is felt with a heavy
pressure and corresponds to Yin and the Yin organs; and the middle level is felt in
between the two levels with a moderate pressure and corresponds to Blood.
   The clinical significance of the three levels is summarized in Table 49.3 .

        The correlation that relates the superficial level to Qi and Yang, the middle level to
Blood and the deep level to Yin is clinically important. This distinction, is after all,
implicit in many of the pulse qualities; for example, when we say that a pulse is Weak
we mean that it is weak at the superficial level and it therefore indicates deficiency of
Yang; when we say that a pulse is Floating-Empty we mean that it is weak at the deep
level and it therefore indicates Yin deficiency; when we say that a pulse is Hollow we
mean that it is empty at the middle level and it therefore indicates deficiency of Blood.
        The above three examples all refer to a deficiency of energy at the three levels. Of
course, the pulse can also be too strong at each of those levels. For example, a Floating
pulse is too superficial and it therefore indicates ‘Excess of Yang', which may be
external (as Wind is a Yang pathogenic factor) or internal; a Firm pulse is by definition
full, strong and hard at the middle and deep levels and it may therefore indicate
Blood stasis or Blood-Heat; a Deep and Full pulse indicates the presence of a
pathogenic factor in the Interior and therefore in the Yin energy. The clinical
significance of the strength of the pulse at each level is summarized in Table 49.4 ,
which also indicates the pulse qualities corresponding to each level.
        Table 49.4
        Clinical significance of the pulse strength at the three levels

Level     Weak                                                  Strong
Superficial Yang or Qi deficiency (Deep, Weak, Soggy, Hidden)   Excess of Yang, invasion of external pathogenic factor (Floating, Big, Overflowing, Wiry)
Middle    Blood deficiency (Choppy, Leather, Hollow, Scattered) Blood-Heat or Blood stasis (Firm, Wiry, Slippery, Big, Overflowing)

I
Deep
          I
          Yin deficiency (Floating-Empty, Leather, Scattered)   Internal Cold or internal Heat, stasis in the Yin organs (Deep, Full, Slippery, Wiry, Firm, Tight)

        Another way of interpreting the three levels is that given by Li Shi Zhen, who
correlates the superficial, middle and deep levels with the energy of Lungs and Heart,
Stomach and Spleen, and Liver and Kidneys respectively (Table 49.3 ). This means
that, according to his theory, the whole of the superficial level (irrespective of
positions) reflects the state of the Lung and Heart, the whole of the middle level
reflects the state of the Stomach and Spleen, and the whole of the deep level
(irrespective of position) reflects the state of the Liver and Kidneys; this thinking is
certainly clinically useful especially when the pulse displays the same quality in all
positions. For example, if the pulse is Empty at the deep level in all positions, we can
certainly deduce that there is a deficiency of Yin of the Liver and Kidneys; that does
not mean to say, of course, that other organs may not have Yin deficiency but if, say,
there was a deficiency of Yin of the Lungs, the pulse would be Empty at the deep level
only in the Lung position. The idea that the three diﬀerent levels can be correlated to
the energy of diﬀerent organs is actually very old and is present in both the ‘Classic of
Diﬃculties' and the ‘Pulse Classic'.
   The ‘Pulse Classic' (Mai Jing ) says:
        Initially one should apply the pressure [equivalent to] 3 soya beans and [this level
     corresponds to] skin and hair and to the energy of the Lungs; with the pressure equivalent
     to 6 soya beans, it corresponds to blood vessels and the energy of the Heart; with the
     pressure equivalent to 9 soya beans it corresponds to the muscles and the energy of the
     Spleen; with the pressure equivalent to 12 soya beans it corresponds to the sinews and the
     energy of the Liver; finally, pressing down to the bone and then releasing the pressure, if
     the pulse comes fast, it corresponds to the energy of the Kidneys. 16
   Wang Shu He (author of the ‘Pulse Classic') obviously relied here on the
description in the ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' which has a passage that is almost identical
in Chapter 5 . 17
   It should be noted that some pulse qualities (Wiry, Slippery, Big, Overflowing, etc.)
manifest of course at more than one level.

     METHOD OF PULSE TAKING
   There are four aspects to the method of taking the pulse:

            • time
            • levelling the arm
            • equalizing the breathing
            • placing the fingers.

     Time
   In theory the best time to take the pulse is in the early morning when the Yin is
calm and the Yang has not yet stirred; it is also the time when the pulse is not aﬀected
by work, eating, emotions, etc. The ‘Simple Questions' explains why the early
morning is the best time to take the pulse: ‘Normally the pulse should be taken in the
morning when Yin Qi has not stirred yet [not yet decreased after the night], Yang Qi is
not yet dispersed [not yet emerged after the night], the patient has not eaten yet, the
main channels are not yet full, the Connecting channels are balanced, and Qi and
Blood are balanced.' 18 Obviously this is not possible in clinical practice and we should
therefore bear in mind the various factors that could aﬀect the pulse in the short term,
that is, hurrying at work, hurrying to get to the clinic, having just had a meal or being
in a state of hunger, an emotional upset, etc.

     Levelling The Arm
   The patient's arm should be horizontal and should not be held higher than the
level of the heart. If the patient is lying down, the arm should be resting on the couch;
it should not be bent, resting on the patient's body (Fig. 49.8 ). If the patient is si ing,
the arm should be resting comfortably on the table. In China, this is the most common
way of taking the pulse, using a small soft cushion for the patient to rest his or her
wrist on.
     (a)                                                       (b)

      FIG. 49.8   Patient's arm position when taking the pulse: (a) sitting; (b) lying down

     Equalizing The Breathing
   Traditionally, equalizing the breathing was necessary to determine whether the
pulse was Slow or Rapid, by relating it to the practitioner's breathing cycle: if the
patient's pulse beats three times or less per practitioner's breathing cycle, it is Slow; if
it beats five times or more, it is Rapid. This method is not used nowadays because we
can make use of a watch to count the rate of a pulse; however, ‘equalizing the
breathing' is still a useful procedure because it facilitates the practitioner's necessary
relaxation and concentration.

     Placing The Fingers
   Placing the fingers involves five aspects, as follows:

           • placing the fingers
           • arranging the fingers
           • regulating the fingers
           • using the fingers
           • moving the fingers

                     - lifting
                     - pressing
                     - searching
                     - pushing
                     - rolling.

     Placing the fingers
   Placing the fingers means that the practitioner's three fingers (index, middle and
ring fingers) are placed simultaneously on the radial artery to make an initial
assessment of the strength, level and quality of the pulse. To assess individual
positions, it may be necessary to lift two of the fingers slightly, while interpreting the
pulse with the third finger. Usually, one feels the pulse of the patient's right arm with
one's left hand and vice versa (Fig. 49.9 ) and the index, middle and ring fingers are
placed on the Front, Middle and Rear positions respectively.

      FIG. 49.9    Placing the fingers when taking the pulse

     Arranging the fingers
   Arranging the fingers means that the practitioner should either spread the fingers
slightly or press them close together according to the size of the patient's arm. For
example, when feeling the pulse of a 10-year-old child, we should press our fingers
closer together to feel the three positions; the younger the child, the closer together
our fingers should be and, in a baby under a year old, we feel the three positions with
a single finger (by rolling it proximally and distally to feel the Rear and Front
positions respectively). When taking the pulse of a very tall man, we should spread
the fingers out slightly to feel the three positions.

     Regulating the fingers
   Regulating the fingers means that the practitioner should place the fingertips on
the three positions, allowing for the diﬀerent length of the fingers. In other words, the
middle finger, being the longest, is slightly contracted. To feel the pulse, the pads
rather than the tips of the fingers are used (Fig. 49.10 ).

      FIG. 49.10    Using the pads of the fingers to take the pulse

     Using the fingers
   Using the fingers means that the practitioner should bear in mind the subtle
diﬀerence in sensitivity between the three fingers. Generally, the ring finger is slightly
more sensitive than the others and we should take this into account when comparing
the diﬀerent strengths of the three positions; however, the diﬀerence in sensitivity is
very small and not too important in clinical practice.

    Moving the fingers
   Moving the fingers means that the fingers should be moved in various directions
when feeling the pulse. It is a common misconception that the pulse is felt by keeping
the fingers absolutely still for a long time; in fact, the fingers are kept still only when
counting the rate of the pulse to decide whether it is Slow, Rapid or normal. The
movements are five (Box 49.3 ).

          BOX 49.3            THE FIVE MOVEMENTS
         • Lifting : this consists of gently lifting the fingers to check the
      strength of the pulse at the superficial level and therefore whether the
      pulse is Floating, normal or deficient at that level.
         • Pressing : this consists of gently pressing the fingers downwards
      to check the strength of the pulse at the middle and deep levels and
      therefore whether the pulse is Deep, normal or deficient at these levels:
      this is necessary to determine whether the pulse is Deep, Hollow,
      Hidden or empty at the deep level.
         • Searching : this consists of not moving the fingers but keeping
      them still to count the rate of the pulse, to decide whether it is Slow,
      Rapid or normal.
         • Pushing : this consists of gently moving the fingers from side to
      side (lateral-medial) in each position (Fig. 49.11 ). This movement is
      necessary to interpret many pulse qualities, such as Slippery, Wiry,
      Leather, Tight, Choppy, Fine, Minute, etc. One can only identify these
      pulse qualities by moving the fingers in this way in order to feel around
      the pulse: it is only by feeling round the pulse that we can determine its
      shape.

                                                       \

                                                           \

            FIG. 49.11   Pushing the fingers from side to side
         • Rolling : this consists of moving the fingers back and forth
      (proximal-distal) in each position (Fig. 49.12 ): this movement is
      necessary to determine whether the pulse is Short, Long or Moving or to
      read the pulse of a child under 1 year old.
               FIG. 49.12   Rolling the fingers

           Remember: the pulse is not felt with the fingers totally still but
        moving the fingers in four ways:
           1. Lifting (upwards)
           2. Pressing (downwards)
           3. Pushing (from side to side)
           4. Rolling (proximal-distal).

    FACTORS AFFECTING THE PULSE
   There is no such thing as a ‘standard' normal pulse. A person's pulse varies
according to many factors, all of which should be taken into account.
   The following factors aﬀect the pulse:

    -
    I
           • season
           • gender
           • age
           • body build
           • menstruation
           • pregnancy
    IL_    • Fan Guan Mai and Xie Fei Mai .
                                                                               -   I

    Season
   The pulse varies considerably according to the seasons (Box 49.4 ), becoming
relatively Wiry in the spring, Overflowing in the summer, Soft in the autumn and
Deep in the winter.

    r      BOX 49.4              SEASONAL PULSES
           -            -
           • Spring: slightly Wiry
           • Summer: superficial, Overflowing
           • Autumn: soft
    IL_    • Winter: Deep                                                          I
   In spring the pulse should be slightly Wiry, straight and relatively Long. It was
traditionally described as ‘feeling like the tender tip of a bamboo pole'.
   In summer the pulse should be more superficial than in other seasons. It should
feel round, slightly Slippery, coming forcefully and disappearing quickly. It was
traditionally described as feeling like a hook or ‘a string of pearls'. In late summer, the
pulse should be relatively soft, light and relaxed and was traditionally described as
‘feeling like the steps of a chicken'.
   In autumn, the pulse should again be relatively soft, superficial, light and relaxed.
It was traditionally described as ‘feeling like a group of seedlings sprouting together'.
   In winter, the pulse should be deeper than at other seasons and should feel
relatively hard and round like a stone.
   The normal seasonal pulses have been described in slightly diﬀerent ways in
various passages from the classics. The ‘Classic of Categories' by Zhang Jing Yue
(1624) describes the pulse in springtime as round and Slippery, in summertime as
Overflowing and Big, in the autumn as Floating and like a hair and in wintertime as
Deep and like a stone. 19 It also says that ‘ In Springtime the pulse is floating like a fish
swimming in the waves; in Summertime it is at the skin level, flooding and full; in the
Autumn it is under the skin and like a hibernating worm about to move; in
Wintertime it is at the level of the bones and like a hidden hibernating worm'. 20
   The ‘Simple Questions' in Chapter 19 describes the normal seasonal pulses as
follows: ‘ In springtime the pulse is like a bowstring … in summertime like a hook …
in the autumn floating … and in wintertime like a storage place. ' 21
   The ‘Simple Questions' describes the normal pulses in each season by comparing
them with various instruments for measuring such as a ruler, the carpenter's square,
the steelyard arm (the arm of a weighing scale) and the counterpoise weight: ‘ In
springtime the pulse should be like a ruler, in summertime like a [carpenter's] square,
in the autumn like the arm of a steelyard and in wintertime like a counterpoise
[weight]. ' 22 The analogy between the seasonal pulses and the measuring instruments
highlights the idea of balance and harmony of the pulse with the changing seasons.
The modern commentary explains that in springtime the pulse should be light, supple
and Slippery, in summertime Overflowing and relatively Rapid, in the autumn
superficial and relatively soft like hair and in wintertime like a stone and Deep.

     Gender
   Men's pulses are relatively stronger than women's in general. There are two other
diﬀerences between men's and women's pulses. First, the left-side pulse is rather
stronger than the right-side pulse in men and vice versa in women; this is only a very
slight diﬀerence (some authors say it is about 8%). The ‘Pulse Classic' (Chapter 7 )
says: ‘ The left side [of the pulse] is big in men, the right side is big in women.' 23 Li Shi
Zhen also discusses the diﬀerences between left and right: ‘ In men the left pulse
should be stronger, in women the right pulse should be stronger.' 24
   Secondly, in men, the Front position is relatively stronger than the Rear one and
vice versa in women (Box 49.5 ). The ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' (Chapter 19 ) says: ‘ In
men the pulse [is found] above the Middle position, in women below the Middle
position. Thus, men's pulse is usually weak on the Rear position while women's pulse
is strong on the Rear position: this is normal.' 25 Li Shi Zhen says something similar in
his book ‘The Study of the Pulse from Pin Hu Lake': ‘There are diﬀerences in the Rear
position in men and women: in women, the Yang [i.e. the Front position] is weak and
the Yin [i.e. the Rear position] is strong.' 26 Qing dynasty's Chen Jia Yuan says:

          BOX 49.5          DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE
      PULSES OF MEN AND WOMEN
          • The left side is slightly stronger in men, the right in women
          • The Front positions are slightly stronger in men, the Rear in
      women (not verified in my practice)
        Men have less Yin and more Yang, women have less Yang and more Yin. South
    corresponds to Fire and man, the two Front pulse positions correspond to South and the
    original Yang, hence they are big and overflowing while the two Rear positions are weak
    and soft. Women correspond to North, and so the two Front pulse positions are fine and
    weak while the two Rear positions are big. 27
   Box 49.5 summarizes gender diﬀerences in the pulse according to the classics.
   It is interesting to note that this situation is hardly ever encountered in practice as
women's pulses are more commonly weak on the Rear position, perhaps indicating a
decline of hereditary Kidney strength compared with previous generations. In my
practice, from a database of more than 2500 patients, I have found that 22% of women
have a very weak pulse on both Rear positions, as opposed to 4.6% of men.

          Contrary to what the classics say, the Rear positions are usually
      weaker in women than in men.

     Age
   The pulse varies considerably with age, especially in its rate, being faster in small
children and slower in old people (see Chapter 50 ). Most Chinese books also say that
the pulse is naturally weaker in old people; I do not find this to be true in practice as
in many cases, the pulse of the elderly is often Full and Wiry. This is because old
people frequently suﬀer from Liver-Wind or Phlegm.

     Body Build
   The pulse should naturally be stronger, larger and longer in robust, large people
and weaker, smaller and shorter in small, frail people. Thus, a pulse that would be
judged to be too weak and short in a robust man might be normal in a small, thin
woman. The ‘Pulse Classic' says:
        When diagnosing from the pulse one must take into account whether the patient is
    large, small, tall or short and whether their nature is placid or nervous. If the pulse,
    whether slow, rapid, big, small, long or short, accords with the patient's nature, it is
    normal; if it does not accord with it, it is abnormal. The three pulse positions tend to be of
    equal size. For example in a small-size person, or a woman, or a thin person the pulse is
    small and soft. 28

     Menstruation
   In the week preceding the onset of the period, the pulse is slightly Slippery,
especially on the right Rear position. When the period arrives, the pulse loses its
Slippery quality and becomes relatively Weak and maybe a bit slower.

     Pregnancy
   The pulse becomes Slippery during pregnancy; this quality is therefore normal in
pregnancy. The more advanced the pregnancy, the more Slippery is the pulse. It is
also normal for the Front and Rear pulses to become stronger in pregnancy.

     Fan Guan Mai And Xie Fei Mai
Fan Guan Mai
   The radial artery is displaced in a small percentage of people (about 5%) so that it
lies on the dorsal rather than the inner aspect of the arm (Fig. 49.13 ). This anatomical
abnormality was called Fan Guan Mai in Chinese, meaning ‘pulse on the opposite
gate'. In such cases (which usually occur on one side only) we cannot interpret the
pulse properly and we should therefore refer to the pulses of the nine regions on the
head, hand and feet. Thus, whenever the pulse cannot be felt at all, or can be felt only
very faintly, we should always check the dorsal aspect of the arm to see if the artery is
displaced, lest we deduce wrongly that the pulse is very weak and almost non-
existent.

      FIG. 49.13   Fan Guan Mai pulse

     Xie Fei Mai
   In a few individuals, the pulse runs from the Rear position obliquely towards the
Front position. This pulse was called Xie Fei Mai , which means Oblique-Flying Pulse.
Like the Fan Guan Mai, it is due to an irregularity of the radial artery which makes it
diﬃcult to read and interpret the pulse properly.
   Box 49.6 summarizes the factors aﬀecting the pulse.

     ATTRIBUTES OF THE NORMAL PULSE
   The normal pulse has three a ributes: ‘spirit', ‘Stomach-Qi' and ‘root'.

     Spirit
   The Chinese word used here is shen , which is of course used very frequently in the
context of diagnosis to indicate a favourable condition, a good prognosis. The word
shen is used in the context of tongue diagnosis, facial and eye diagnosis. In the context
of pulse diagnosis, a pulse has ‘spirit' when it is soft and gentle but with strength. It
also has ‘spirit' when it is regular in rate and ‘orderly' in quality. A pulse without
‘spirit' is too hard, not soft, not gentle, perhaps irregular and maybe also changing
quality frequently.

     Stomach-Qi
   The pulse has Stomach-Qi when it is relatively slow (Slowed-down, i.e. four beats
per breathing cycle), gentle, calm and relatively soft.
   We feel the pulse on the radial artery along the Lung channel to gauge the state of
Qi and Blood of all the organs; however, the Qi of the organs cannot reach the Lung
channel without the force of Stomach-Qi. As a Chinese textbook says, ‘ The food
essences enter the Stomach, Food-Qi goes to the Heart and the excess enters the blood
vessels. The Qi of the blood vessels flows in the twelve channels which are all under
the control of the Lungs.' 29 This means that Lung-Qi reflects the Qi of all the channels
and blood vessels and for this reason we can feel the pulse on the radial artery along
the Lung channel, but Lung-Qi relies on the motive force and nourishment of
Stomach-Qi to reach the channels and blood vessels.
   The Stomach has an important influence on the pulse as it is from the Stomach that
the motive force for the beating of the Heart comes. Also, the beating of the left
ventricle that can be felt below and to the left of the left nipple is, in Chinese medicine,
the beating of Xu Li , that is, the Great Connecting channel of the Stomach. The
Stomach is the Source of Post-Heaven Qi, the Sea of Food, the source of Postnatal Qi
and Blood and it therefore gives ‘body' to the pulse; for this reason, a pulse that is not
soft, too hard, not gentle and not Slowed-down means that it has no Stomach-Qi.
   It is important not to confuse the quality of having ‘Stomach-Qi' with the actual
Stomach pulse as the former applies to all pulse positions. Moreover, it is important to
stress that ‘not having Stomach-Qi' does not necessarily imply a deficiency: ‘not
having Stomach-Qi' can apply both to Deficient- and to Full-type pulses. Thus, for
example, a Wiry pulse by definition lacks Stomach-Qi because it is too hard;
conversely, a Soggy pulse also lacks Stomach-Qi because it is too soft.

          Remember: a pulse may lack ‘Stomach-Qi' by being too soft (Empty)
      or too hard (Full).
          Root
         The normal pulse should have a ‘root'; this has two meanings. First, it means that
the pulse on the Kidney position should be normal; secondly, the pulse at the deep
level (corresponding to Liver and Kidneys in Li Shi Zhen's configuration described
above) should be normal. Thus, a pulse ‘without root' is either very weak on the
Kidney positions or very empty at the deep level.
         In a few cases, however, obstruction of the Lower Burner or the Uterus by Cold
may cause the Kidney pulse to be very weak or almost imperceptible. This is due to
Cold obstructing the Lower Burner and preventing the blood coming through to the
Rear position of the pulse; it would be wrong to interpret this pulse as having ‘no
root' because, once Cold is removed, the Kidney pulse returns to normal. Thus, if the
Kidney pulse is very weak, one should always bear in mind the possibility that this
might be due to obstruction of the Lower Burner by Cold and check the symptoms
and signs to exclude this.
         To summarize, the normal pulse has ‘spirit', which indicates good Heart-Qi,
Stomach-Qi, which indicates good Stomach-Qi, and a root, which indicates good
Kidney-Qi; these three aspects correspond to the Three Treasures: Spirit, Qi and
Essence (Jing-Qi-Shen ) (Table 49.5 ).

                       Kidneys Essence (Jing )

         I would add that the normal pulse also has a fourth quality and that is a ‘wave'.
This is a clear, smooth, wave-like movement from the Rear towards the Front position;
such a pulse indicates good Stomach- and Heart-Qi. The pulse ‘without wave' lacks
the smooth, wave-like flow and may be pathological either because it has no wave or
because its wave movement is excessively long. Many pulse qualities actually depict a
pulse without wave (e.g. Short, Choppy, Sca ered, Weak, Soggy), whereas others
depict a pulse with an excessive wave (e.g. Wiry, Long, Overflowing, Big). The pulse
lacking a wave often reflects the presence of emotional problems due to sadness and
grief, while the pulse with an excessive wave often reflects emotional problems due to
anger.
         Passages from both the ‘Pulse Classic' and the ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' seem to
describe the a ribute of a normal pulse with wave even though they do not mention
this word. For example, the ‘Pulse Classic' says:
             The position behind the Inch and in front of the Foot position is the Gate position; this
          is the boundary between the emerging Yang [at the Inch position] and submerging Yin [at
          the Foot position]. Emerging Yang occupies three divisions [positions] and submerging
          Yin also occupies three divi-sions [positions]. Yang originates at the Foot position and
          moves [or manifests] towards the Inch position; Yin originates in the Inch position and
          moves [or manifests] towards the Foot position. 30
         This passage clearly implies the notion of a wave of Qi, in its Yin and Yang
qualities, moving in the pulse from the Inch to the Rear and from the Rear to the Inch
position (Fig. 49.14 ).

      FIG. 49.14   Wave-like flow of Qi in the pulse
   The ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' in Chapter 3 has a similar concept in a passage that
describes the pulse lacking a wave (Fig. 49.14b ) or having an excessive wave:
        In front of the Gate position, Yang moves and the pulse should extend in 9 fen and be
    near the surface; if it exceeds 9 fen, it is in excess and if it is shorter than 9 fen, it is
    deficient … Behind the Gate position, Yin moves and the pulse should extend to 1 cun and
    be at the deep level. If it exceeds 1 cun, it is in excess, while if it is less than 1 cun, it is
    deficient. 31
   This passage essentially describes Long and Short pulse qualities and a pulse
having an excessive wave or lacking one respectively.
   Box 49.7 summarizes the a ributes of a normal pulse.

           BOX 49.7             ATTRIBUTES OF A NORMAL PULSE
          • Spirit: soft, gentle but with strength, regular
          • Stomach-Qi: gentle, calm, relatively soft, relatively slow
          • Root: normal on the Rear positions and at the deep level
          • Wave: pulse with clear, smooth wave from the Rear to the Front
      position

  GUIDELINES FOR INTERPRETING THE
PULSE
   When taking the pulse, I recommend assessing the aspects in the following order.
         1. Feel the pulse as a whole with three fingers to get an initial idea of
      its overall strength or weakness.
         2. Feel whether the pulse has spirit, Stomach-Qi and root.
         3. Feel the three positions first with three fingers and then
      individually by gently lifting two of the fingers and feeling with the
      third.
         4. Feel the three levels by constantly lifting and pressing the fingers,
      searching for them.
         5. Feel the overall quality of the pulse, if there is one.
         6. Feel the pulse quality, strength and level of each individual pulse
      position by rolling and pushing the fingers as described above.
         7. Count the pulse rate.
   It is a good idea to train oneself to assess the above aspects of the pulse in a
rational order; for example, when taking the pulse one should never immediately
concentrate on a particular quality of a specific organ position without first assessing
the pulse as a whole. Each of the above aspects of pulse taking has its own clinical
significance.

    Feeling The Pulse As A Whole With Three Fingers
   Feeling the pulse as a whole with three fingers gives us an initial idea of the overall
strength or weakness of the pulse; this gives us an initial assessment of the patient's
constitution and the strength of his or her body's Qi. It also enables us to appraise
whether the pulse matches the person's body build.

    Feeling The Spirit, Stomach-Qi And Root
   Feeling the spirit, Stomach-Qi and root of the pulse gives us an idea of the state of
the Mind, Stomach-Qi and Kidneys. Stomach-Qi is particularly important as it gives
us an immediate idea of whether the pulse is normal or not: any pulse that is either
too soft or too hard and full immediately tells us that Stomach-Qi is lacking.

    Feeling The Three Positions Together First And Then
Individually
   Feeling the three positions together first is important to give us an idea of the
overall strength or weakness of the pulse and also to compare the relative strengths of
the left and right pulses. After feeling the three positions together with the three
fingers, we should feel each position individually, gently lifting two of the fingers and
feeling with the third. At this stage, this is done not so much to feel the state of the
Internal Organs related to each position but more to get an idea of the distribution and
balance of Qi among the three positions and therefore the Three Burners.
   It is important to remember that the feeling of strength or weakness in the three
pulse positions reflects the state and distribution of Qi in the Three Burners,
irrespective of the individual organs; in other words, we can get a good idea of the
strength or weakness of Qi and its ‘rebelliousness' (flowing in the wrong direction) by
carefully feeling and assessing the flow of Qi in the three pulse positions initially
ignoring the organs associated with those positions. To put it diﬀerently, we must
remember that the three pulse positions reflect parts of the body as well as organs.
The ‘Simple Questions' confirms this in Chapter 17 when it says: ‘ When the upper
[position] of the pulse is strong [it means that] Qi is rushing upwards; when the lower
[position] of the pulse is strong [it means that] Qi is distended [below].' 32
   At this stage, we can get an initial idea of the relative strength of Qi and Blood in
the Three Burners. For example, if the pulse is very weak on both Rear positions and
relatively overflowing on both Front positions, this may indicate that Qi is rebelling
upwards and that this upward rebellion is most probably due to a deficiency of Qi and
Blood in the Lower Burner so that Qi is not ‘anchored' in the Lower Burner and rebels
upwards towards the Upper Burner.

     Feeling The Three Levels
   One feels the three levels by constantly lifting and pressing down the fingers to
‘search' for them. It is a good idea to search for the middle level in two diﬀerent ways:
first by gently pressing down from the superficial level, and then by pressing all the
way down to the deep level and slowly lifting the fingers to stop at the middle level.
   Feeling the three levels is essential to give us an idea of the state of Qi/Yang, Blood
and Yin and also of the level of Qi in the body. For example, if the pulse is Floating-
Empty, this means two things: first, that Qi is weak at the deep level and in relative
excess at the superficial level; secondly, that there is a Yin deficiency with a relative
Yang excess. These are not two diﬀerent phenomena but simply two diﬀerent ways of
interpreting the same clinical situation and expressing its pathology.
   Integrating the three positions (corresponding to the Three Burners) with the three
levels, we form a three-dimensional picture of the Qi in the body in a similar way that
Western medicine does with CT (computerized tomography), MRI (magnetic
resonance imaging) and PET (positron emission tomography) scans (Fig. 49.15 ). This
picture is clinically relevant even without referring to the correspondence of positions
to organs at all. The relative strength of Qi in each Burner and at each level is clinically
significant even without referring to the organs at all and it is actually a good exercise
when reading the pulse not to get too ‘fixated' on the assignment of each position to a
particular organ. In other words, an assessment of Qi in the three positions and three
levels gives us a dynamic picture of the distribution and balance of Qi in the body
which is necessary before we analyse each position in its relation to a particular organ.

   and the three energetic layers and between the left and right pulse and the left and right side

     Feeling The Overall Quality Of The Pulse, If There Is
One
   The next step is to try to feel if the pulse has an overall quality, remembering that a
pulse's ‘quality' can be felt only by ‘rolling' and ‘pushing' the fingers as described
above. The pulse does not always have an overall quality; for example, it may be
slightly Overflowing in the Heart position but very Weak in the Spleen/Stomach
position. In contrast, a pulse may feel very clearly and very definitely Wiry in all
positions, giving a strong indication of a Liver disharmony (or Phlegm).
   If a pulse has a clear, overall quality, this generally means that the disharmony of
the patient is fairly simple; for example, if all the pulse positions are Wiry, this
indicates a Liver disharmony (or Phlegm) and no other disharmonies. In contrast, if a
pulse has several diﬀerent qualities in diﬀerent positions, this indicates that the
patient suﬀers from a complex disharmony characterized by both Deficiency and
Excess conditions in various organs.

     Feeling The Pulse Quality, Strength And Level Of
Each Individual Position By Rolling And Pushing The
Fingers
   The next step consists in feeling the pulse quality, strength and level of each
individual position by gently lifting two fingers while the third concentrates on a
particular position. It is important to note that to assess each individual position the
finger is constantly moving, searching, exploring the shape and level of pulse; this is
done by ‘rolling' the finger distally and medially, ‘pushing' the finger medially and
laterally, and ‘lifting and pressing' the finger to feel the level of the pulse. Rolling tells
us whether the pulse in that position is Short, Long, Choppy, Moving or without
wave; pushing tells us whether the pulse in that position is Choppy, Slippery, Wiry,
Weak, Sca ered, Big, Overflowing, Fine, Minute, etc.; lifting and pressing tells us
whether the pulse in that position is Floating, Deep, Weak, Soggy, Floating-Empty,
Hidden, Leathery, or Firm.

     Counting The Pulse Rate
   Finally, counting of the pulse rate is carried out. As mentioned above, in past times
this was done by referring the pulse rate to the breathing rate of the practitioners.
Nowadays, we simply count the pulse rate with a watch. This is of course crucial to
diagnosing pulse qualities that reflect irregularities of the pulse rate and rhythm (e.g.
Slow, Rapid, Slowed-Down, Hurried, Moving, Kno ed, Hasty, Intermi ent).

  CLINICAL APPLICATION OF PULSE
DIAGNOSIS
   Pulse diagnosis is an essential part of Chinese diagnosis for many reasons. Two
aspects could be singled out as being the most important features of pulse diagnosis:
first, apart from giving us indications about prevailing disharmonies, it also reflects
the constitution of a person; secondly, when expertly applied, pulse diagnosis can
give us a very detailed and accurate picture of the state of Qi in all organs and all parts
of the body.
   The following are some examples of the clinical application of pulse diagnosis.
     The Pulse Is Often Crucial In Clinching A Diagnosis
   The pulse is often crucial in clinching a diagnosis. A common example of the value
of the pulse in clinching the diagnosis is when a person (usually a man) presents
complaining of tiredness, sluggishness and general listlessness. He may speak with a
low voice and the general first impression would be that a Deficiency is the cause of
the problem. However, if the pulse is Wiry on both sides (as often happens in such
patients), this clearly points to Liver-Qi stagnation as the cause of the problem; in such
a case, the pulse is often the only symptom pointing to a Full condition, and
specifically Liver-Qi stagnation, as the cause of the problem.
   Case history 49.1 is an illustration of the value of the pulse in clinching a diagnosis.

               Case History 49.1
         A 65-year-old woman complained of an acute pain in the ribs on the
      left-hand side. She had seen her doctor and an orthopaedic surgeon
      who had ordered X-rays, which showed no abnormality. Both the
      doctor and the surgeon treated this as a musculoskeletal problem.
         When asking her about her symptom I was also somewhat puzzled
      as she had no symptoms of a Liver or Gall-Bladder pa ern that might
      explain the rib pain. I was also puzzled as to why, if this was indeed a
      musculoskeletal problem, it should start suddenly without a fall or any
      other apparent cause. However, her pulse told a completely diﬀerent
      story: it was very Rapid (over 100), Overflowing and Slippery. In
      particular, the right Front position (Lung position) was very
      Overflowing. This pulse clearly indicated that, far from being a simple
      musculoskeletal problem, she had a serious internal organ problem
      and, although one cannot conclusively diagnose cancer, I suspected
      there was a serious disease in the left lung causing the rib pain. I
      thought this would be either pleurisy or a carcinoma.
         I insisted that she went back to the doctor for further tests. An MRI
      scan and blood tests showed that she had carcinoma of the left lung and
      spine.

     The Pulse Is Essential To Distinguish Deficiency
From Excess
   Distinguishing Deficiency from Excess is one of the most useful aspects of pulse
diagnosis. In many cases, the patient presents with a mixture of Deficiency and
Excess; indeed, this, rather than a pure Deficiency or pure Excess condition, is
probably the most common situation in practice.
   Postviral fatigue syndrome is a good example of this situation: practically all
patients suﬀering from this condition suﬀer from retention of Dampness together with
a deficiency of the Spleen, Stomach, Lungs or Kidneys, or a mixture of these.
However, the combination of a Deficient and an Excess condition is never 50-50: one
aspect is always predominant and it is often not easy to determine this from the
symptoms and signs. For example, a patient suﬀering from postviral fatigue
syndrome will experience extreme fatigue and poor appetite (symptoms of
Deficiency) but also muscle aches and a feeling of heaviness (symptoms of Fullness, in
this case Dampness). In such a situ-ation, the pulse is absolutely crucial in clinching
whether the Deficiency or the Excess predominates: if the pulse is on the whole weak,
this means that the Deficiency predominates; if the pulse is on the whole of the full
type, this means that the Excess predominates. Thus, in this case, the pulse is the
single most important aspect of diagnosis to make this diﬀerentiation.
   The important implication of this is that the pulse therefore determines the choice
of treatment principle: if it is weak on the whole, we should concentrate on tonifying
the Upright Qi; if it is of the full type on the whole, we should concentrate on
expelling pathogenic factors (in this case, resolve Dampness).

    The Pulse Is Essential To Determine The Treatment
Principle
   The pulse is essential to determine the treatment principle in complex conditions
of mixed Deficiency and Excess. The example of postviral fatigue syndrome was given
above. Another example could be a situation of Liver-Blood deficiency leading to
Liver-Yang rising; this situation is very common in women and it is often the cause of
menstrual problems such as premenstrual tension or menstrual headaches. The
symptoms themselves may not help us to determine whether the deficiency of Liver-
Blood or the rising of Liver-Yang predominates. The pulse can help us to diﬀerentiate
this very clearly: if it is Choppy or Fine, the deficiency of Liver-Blood predominates
and we should therefore nourish Blood; if it is Wiry, the rising of Liver-Yang
predominates and we should therefore subdue Liver-Yang.

    The Pulse In Emotional Problems
   In many situations, the pulse reflects emotional problems clearly. A few examples
will be given here.
   When a person is aﬀected by sadness, grief or worry, the Heart pulse may become
slightly and relatively Overflowing; it is important to note that this is not the true
Overflowing pulse, but it is nevertheless slightly Overflowing in relation to the other
positions. Often the pulse may be quite Weak or Choppy on the whole, but a careful
feeling of the Heart position reveals that it is very slightly Overflowing compared with
the rest of the pulse. This Heart-pulse quality is quite subtle and may be easily missed;
besides being more superficial compared with the other pulse positions, the Heart
pulse also feels somewhat ‘round' and very slightly Slippery. This is a sure sign that
the patient is deeply aﬀected by emotional problems such as sorrow, sadness or grief
aﬀecting the Heart. When all the other pulses are weak but the Heart pulse is
relatively Overflowing as described, this usually indicates that the person is suﬀering
from sadness and bears the emotional strain in silence.
   Another good example of a clear reflection of emotional stress by the pulse is the
situation when a patient may appear very depressed, walk slowly and talk with a low
voice - all of which lead us to assume that he or she suﬀers from a Deficiency;
however, very often (and more commonly in men), the pulse of these people is
extremely Wiry and Full in all positions. This is an absolutely reliable indication that
that person is not really depressed but angry, or, to put it diﬀerently, may be
depressed because of repressed anger.
   A Rapid pulse is another indication of emotional stress. Usually the person is
under great stress and suﬀers from fear, anxiety, guilt or the consequence of shock.
Case history 49.2 is an illustration of this point.

                Case History 49.2
          A 28-year-old woman complained of tiredness, nausea and
      dizziness. She had no other symptoms and she seemed quite healthy.
      Emotionally she appeared to be quite happy and she spoke with a
      cheerful, ringing voice, smiling frequently. All the indications were,
      therefore, that she suﬀered from a simple deficiency of the Spleen and
      possibly Blood as many women do. However, the pulse showed a
      completely diﬀerent picture: it was Fine and very Rapid (over 100). Her
      tongue had a red tip. I had the feeling that she had long-standing,
      repressed emotional problems and I suspected shock was the main
      cause of them. When I asked her whether she had suﬀered a shock
      some years before she burst into tears and said that she had been
      sexually abused from the age of 6 to 9.
          Of course, we should exclude other causes of a Rapid pulse such as
      an infection, a true Heat pa ern or Blood Heat. In the absence of clear
      Heat symptoms and signs, a Rapid pulse usually indicates the above-
      mentioned emotional problems.
          A pulse without wave indicates that the person suﬀers from sadness
      or grief, which may also be indicated by a very Weak Lung pulse. A
      Full Lung pulse may indicate that the person suﬀers either from worry
      or from unexpressed grief. If both Front positions (Lungs and Heart)
      are Weak and Short, they indicate long-standing emotional problems
      deriving from sadness or grief. A Moving pulse often indicates shock; it
      should be noted that the pulse may retain this quality many years after
      the original shock.
   Box 49.8 summarizes the pulse qualities in emotional problems.

          BOX 49.8          THE PULSE IN EMOTIONAL
      PROBLEMS
          • Heart pulse slightly Overflowing: sadness, grief or worry
          • All pulses Wiry and Full: repressed anger or frustration
          • Rapid pulse: fear, guilt or shock
          • Pulse without a wave: sadness or grief
          • Weak Lung pulse: sadness or grief
          • Full Lung pulse: worry or unexpressed grief
          • Both Front positions Weak and Short: long-standing sadness or
      grief
          • Moving pulse: shock
     The Pulse As An Indicator Of An Organ Problem
   When all the pulse positions are very weak and deep except for one, this usually
indicates that the organ corresponding to that position is ‘diseased'. This often points
to an actual organic disease in a Western medical sense (rather than a Chinese pa ern
of disharmony), but it is by no means an absolute rule. For example, if the pulse is
Weak, Choppy and Deep in all positions except in the Heart position, this may simply
indicate deep emotional problems as described above, but it may also indicate an
actual heart problem; the la er is all the more likely if the Heart pulse feels Slippery
and Fine, and particularly if Slippery in its medial and lateral sides.
   A Floating quality on the Heart pulse also often indicates a problem with the heart
itself, especially if it is Floating-Hollow on the lateral and medial sides of the pulse
position (which may indicate high blood pressure). A Floating-Weak-Hollow quality
indicates that the heart is dilated; this occurs often in people who jog for long
distances every day. A Floating-Tight-Hollow quality may indicate hardening of the
arteries.

     The Pulse As An Indicator Of A Heart Problem
   Just as Heart-Qi is reflected on the pulse as a whole, irrespective of positions, the
condition of the heart (in the Western sense) is also reflected on the whole pulse, not
only at the left Front position. We should always remember that when we feel the
pulse we feel the radial artery, which is a blood vessel, and that the Heart governs all
blood vessels; thus, by definition, the general feeling of the radial artery reflects the
condition of the Heart in a Chinese sense and also of the heart in a Western medical
sense.
   For example, when the whole pulse is Wiry, Slippery, Overflowing and Hurried
and feels very hard, aortic aneurysm may be suspected.
   If the pulse is Hurried (i.e. very rapid and agitated) and generally Full, this often
indicates a heart problem such as tachycardia (in all its various types, e.g.
supraventricular tachycardia, junctional tachycardia or broad-complex tachycardia).
Similarly, any irregu-larity of the pulse (Kno ed, Hasty, Intermi ent) may indicate a
heart conduction problem such as atrial fibrillation (when it is rapid and irregular, i.e.
Hasty), sick sinus syndrome, Wolﬀ-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome or Lown-
Ganong-Levine (LGL) syndrome.
   If the pulse is extremely Slow, this may also indicate a heart problem such as sick
sinus syndrome or atrioventricular block (unless, of course, it is due to intense, regular
exercise such as in athletes).
   If the pulse is Minute or Sca ered, this may indicate the possibility of heart failure.
The medial and lateral aspects of the Heart pulse may reflect problems of the valves
such as mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation or mitral prolapse; in such cases, these
aspects of the Heart pulse (felt by rolling the finger medially and laterally very
slightly) feel Slippery or Tight. (See Fig. 50.2 on p. 500 .)
   Case histories 49.3 -49.5 illustrate the use of the pulse in diagnosing heart
conditions.
        Case History 49.3
   A 45-year-old woman complained of extreme tiredness, something
she had been suﬀering from for over 20 years. She also complained of
poor memory, floaters, tinnitus, frequent urination and occasional
dribbling of urine. She also suﬀered from constipation and her periods
had stopped 6 months previously.
   As a child, she had suﬀered from frequent bouts of bronchitis and
pneumonia. She had received acupuncture treatment for 5 years and
Chinese herbs for about 2; these treatments did produce some
improvement but it never lasted.
   Her tongue was slightly Red on the sides and Swollen and her pulse
was Deep, very Weak, Choppy, Fine and Slow (52).
   Three main pa erns emerge from an analysis of the clinical
manifestations: Liver-Blood deficiency (stoppage of the periods,
floaters, tiredness, Choppy pulse), Kidney-Yang deficiency (tinnitus,
frequent urination, dribbling of urine, tiredness, constipation, Deep-
Weak-Slow pulse), and Heart-Blood deficiency (poor memory, Choppy
pulse). However, the fact that the pulse is very Weak, Choppy and Fine
in all positions and also that it is very Slow clearly indicates that the
main problem probably lies in the Heart, and specifically a severe
deficiency of Qi and Blood of the Heart. This deficiency may be
congenital or may have been induced by the frequent bouts of
bronchitis and pneumonia during her childhood. I advised this patient
to have her heart examined by a cardiologist; she did this and the
cardiologist did say that the pericardium membrane was enlarged and
showed signs of inflammation.
   The principle of treatment in this case, therefore, should be not only
to nourish Liver-Blood and tonify Kidney-Yang, but also to tonify the
Qi and Blood of the Heart.

        Case History 49.4
   A 60-year-old man sought treatment for a frozen shoulder. On
taking his pulse, I noticed that it was very Full, Slippery, Wiry, very
Overflowing and Rapid. The combination of these qualities to such a
degree clearly indicated not only a Heart disharmony but also the
possibility of a problem in the heart or blood vessels; however, he had
no symptoms of heart problems (no hypertension, no chest pain, no
arrhythmia). Although he came to me for treatment of his shoulder
problem, I tried to encourage him to see a cardiologist, which he did
and he was found to have an aneurysm of the aorta for which he
needed an operation.

        Case History 49.5
   A 25-year-old woman complained of painful periods with clear
symptoms of Cold in the Uterus (spastic pain, feeling cold during the
         period, menstrual blood with small dark clots, Pale tongue, Slow
         pulse). However, a striking feature of her pulse (for her age) was its
         Slowness (48) and its stopping at irregular intervals: such pulse quality
         (Slow and stopping at irregular intervals) is called Kno ed. This
         indicated the possibility, not only of a Heart disharmony, but of an
         actual heart problem and she was advised to see a cardiologist who
         indeed diagnosed a conduction problem in the heart.

    The Pulse Does Not Necessarily Reflect All The
Aspects Of A Disharmony
   As for the tongue, we should not expect the pulse to reflect all the aspects of a
disharmony. For example, if a woman suﬀers from Liver-Qi stagnation causing very
clear symptoms of premenstrual tension with distension of the breasts and abdomen
and irritability, the pulse may not be Wiry if the Liver-Qi stagnation occurs against a
background of Liver-Blood deficiency; in such a case, the pulse may be Weak and
Choppy reflecting the Liver-Blood deficiency but not the Liver-Qi stagnation. The
opposite may also occur: in the above example, the pulse may be Wiry if the Liver-Qi
stagnation is intense, in which case the pulse quality reflects only this pa ern and not
the Liver-Blood deficiency.
   In the elderly, the pulse is frequently of the full type, often being Wiry or Slippery,
or both; this happens because old people suﬀer frequently from chronic Phlegm,
Blood stasis or internal Wind, all of which may make the pulse Wiry and hard.
However, very many old people suﬀering from such pa erns also frequently suﬀer
from Yin deficiency (which may be apparent from a lack of tongue coating); the Wiry
and Full quality of the pulse masks the Yin deficiency, which does not show on the
pulse.

    The Pulse Indicates Disharmonies Beyond The
Presenting Patterns
   When the pulse indicates disharmonies beyond the presenting pa erns it raises the
important issue of integration of pulse diagnosis with symptom diagnosis. In the
majority of cases, the pulse and clinical manifestations accord with each other; for
example, if a patient displays all the symptoms of Phlegm, the pulse is most likely
Slippery. In other cases, as mentioned above, the pulse reflects only one aspect of a
disharmony. There are cases, however, when the pulse seems to be at variance with
the clinical manifestations, or at least unrelated to them. The tendency in modern
China (according to my experience) is to give more importance to the clinical
manifestations; if the pulse does not accord with them it is simply ignored. I
personally disagree with this approach as I think that the pulse is always clinically
significant and should never be discarded as a diagnostic sign.
   Many examples could be given of situations when the pulse seems to be unrelated
to the clinical manifestations (not necessarily contradicting them); for example, the
patient has symptoms of Phlegm but the pulse is not Slippery, the patient has no
symptoms of Phlegm but the pulse is Slippery, the patient appears to be an exuberant,
Yang type of person but the pulse is very Weak and Deep; the patient has no
symptoms of any Liver disharmony but the pulse is Wiry (or vice versa), etc.
   In such cases, apart from the above-mentioned situation when the pulse reflects
one aspect of a disharmony and the clinical manifestations another, a pulse that is
seemingly unrelated to the presenting clinical manifestations simply reflects the
existence of a disharmony that has not yet caused symptoms.
   A common example relates to the Lung pulse: a woman may present with clinical
manifestations of Liver-Qi stagnation causing premenstrual tension or other
menstrual irregularities and the pulse is slightly Wiry but the position that most
stands out is that of the Lung being extremely Weak and Deep. What are we to make
of this? Since all the clinical manifestations and the Wiry pulse point to a Liver
disharmony shall we ignore the Lung position? In my opinion, this should never be
done. In this example, the weakness of the Lung position simply indicates that this
patient suﬀers from Lung-Qi deficiency without symptoms of it yet ; the weakness of
the Lung position should never be ignored also because, after all, a Weak Lung pulse
is reflective of Lung-Qi deficiency as much as a weak voice and chronic cough. In such
a case, I would definitely pay a ention to the weakness of the Lung pulse and tonify
the Lungs (in addition to treating the Liver disharmony).
   To give another example relating to a full rather than empty-type of pulse, it
happens frequently that a person has no symptoms of Phlegm but the pulse is clearly
Slippery; barring the cases when a Slippery pulse may indicate health (or of course
pregnancy), this definitely indicates that the patient is suﬀering from Phlegm even
though there are no manifestations of it.
   Incidentally, this characteristic applies to tongue diagnosis too: the tongue also can
show disharmonies beyond the presenting manifestations. A good example is a
central Stomach crack on the tongue indicating a tendency to Stomach-Yin deficiency
even in the absence of any digestive symptoms.

     The Pulse Can Indicate An Underlying Deficiency In
The Absence Of Symptoms
   When the pulse is Weak in a certain position, it definitely indicates Deficiency of
that particular organ whether there are symptoms of Deficiency or not. It is precisely
for this reason that pulse diagnosis allows us to give preventive treatment before the
onset of clinical manifestations.
   A weakness of the Kidney pulse (often on both sides) is the most common example
of this situation. There are very many patients (especially women) who have a very
Weak pulse on both Rear positions without any symptoms of Kidney deficiency;
however, as mentioned above, a Weak and Deep pulse on both Rear positions reflects
a Kidney deficiency as much as tiredness, backache, dizziness and tinnitus do. Indeed,
this is precisely one reason why pulse diagnosis is so important: it points to a certain
disharmony unequivocally, which is more than isolated symptoms do. In the example
just mentioned above, if the patient suﬀered only from dizziness we could not
diagnose a Kidney deficiency because this symptom may be due to many other
disharmonies (Blood deficiency, Phlegm, Liver-Yang rising, etc.), but the weakness of
the pulse on both Rear positions points unequivocally to a Kidney deficiency.
    The Pulse In Cancer
   There is no specific pulse quality or pulse picture that allows us to diagnose cancer
unequivocally. Generally speaking, in advanced cancer two opposite pulse pictures
may emerge: either the pulse becomes extremely Weak, Choppy, Fine and Deep or it
becomes Full, Slippery, Overflowing and Rapid.
   Although the pulse cannot be used to diagnose cancer, it is very important to
determine the prognosis and the treatment principle.
   As for prognosis , if a patient has cancer the prognosis is poor if the pulse has either
of the pictures described above (i.e. it is either very Deep, Weak, Choppy and Fine, or
very Full, Slippery, Overflowing and Rapid). If the pulse in addition is particularly
Rapid and Overflowing this may indicate the presence of Toxic Heat, which is never a
good sign in cancer or in cancer patients who have undergone Western treatment.
   As for the treatment principle , the pulse is very important indeed. Generally
speaking, cancer patients will undergo some treatment in the form of surgery,
radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or a combination of these. At the end of these
treatments, our role is to stimulate the immune system to prevent a recurrence. From
the point of view of Chinese medicine, we have to assess the condition of the patient
as if the cancer were still present. In fact, Western treatments may remove the cancer
surgically, by radiotherapy or chemotherapy, but they do not remove the pa erns that
were at the root of the cancer; the most common pa erns seen are Phlegm, Blood
stasis, Toxic Heat and Dampness.
   We should therefore assess the patient's condition very carefully to determine
whether Deficiency or Excess predominates, that is, whether the above pathogenic
factors are relatively weak and the main problem is a deficiency of the Upright Qi or
whether the above pathogenic factors are still quite strong. In the former case, the aim
is to tonify the Upright Qi primarily and expel pathogenic factors secondarily; in the
la er case the aim is to expel pathogenic factors primarily and tonify the Upright Qi
secondarily. The pulse is crucial in making this distinction and choosing the
appropriate treatment principle: if the pulse is primarily Weak, Fine, Choppy or
Empty, we need to concentrate our a ention on tonifying the Upright Qi; if the pulse
is of the full type, Slippery, Wiry, Tight or Firm, we need to concentrate on expelling
pathogenic factors (which may be to resolve Phlegm, invigorate Blood, resolve
Dampness or clear Toxic Heat).

         In cancer patients after surgery, the pulse is crucial in determining
      whether there is still an active pathogenic factor and therefore in
      determining the treatment principle.
   For example, let us assume that a woman suﬀering from a malignant breast
tumour comes to us after undergoing a lumpectomy and ensuing radiotherapy. We
should assess her condition carefully as if she still had the tumour because the surgery
and radiotherapy have removed the tumour but not the pa ern at the root of its
formation. The pa erns appearing in breast cancer are usually Phlegm or Blood stasis,
or both, in diﬀering combinations; of course, there is often also Qi stagnation but this
cannot cause a tumour by itself, whereas Phlegm and Blood stasis can.
   When presented with such patients we should therefore not assume in all cases
that we must tonify the Upright Qi to prevent a recurrence: we must choose the
treatment principle according to the clinical manifestations bearing in mind that we
cannot rely on an examination of the tumour as this has been removed. In the
presence of a tumour we would palpate it to decide whether it is caused by Phlegm
(in which case it is relatively soft and painless) or by Blood stasis (in which case it is
hard and probably painful). A decision on the choice of treatment principles relies a
lot on the pulse: if this is of the empty type, we should concentrate our a ention on
tonifying the Upright Qi; if it is of the full type (Slippery, Wiry, Tight) we should
concentrate on expelling pathogenic factors (resolve Phlegm or invigorate Blood, or
both). If the pulse in addition is also Rapid and Overflowing this may indicate the
presence of Toxic Heat and we need to clear Heat and resolve Toxin (in herbal
medicine this is done by using herbs from the category which clear Toxic Heat, many
of which have also an anticancer eﬀect).

  INTEGRATION OF PULSE AND TONGUE
DIAGNOSIS
   There are many ways in which the integration of pulse and tongue diagnosis is
crucial in clinical practice.

     Qi And Blood
   The pulse and tongue are quite complementary in so far as the pulse reflects more
the state of Qi while the tongue that of Blood; of course this is a generalization
(because the pulse can reflect the state of Blood, e.g. when it is Choppy), but it is a
useful one nevertheless.
   This distinction can be useful in patients suﬀering from emotional problems. For
example, a Wiry and Full pulse often indicates a Liver pa ern deriving from
emotional stress and if the tongue-body colour is normal this tells us that the
emotional problem is not long standing; if the tongue is Red this indicates that the
emotional problem is more long standing and more severe.

     Time Factor
   The pulse is more influenced by short-term factors than is the tongue. For example,
a period of overwork, an emotional upset and physical exercise can all change the
pulse in the short term but not the tongue.
   For this reason, the tongue is a good indicator of the length of a problem; for
example, an Overflowing Heart pulse indicates that the person is under emotional
stress and if the tongue is Red with a redder tip this indicates that this problem is long
standing.
   Another example is that of Blood stasis. A Choppy or Firm pulse may point to
Blood stasis and if the tongue is Purple this indicates that the problem is of long
duration. Another good example is that of Yin deficiency. A Floating-Empty pulse
indicates Yin deficiency and we can tell exactly the stage of Yin deficiency by
observing the degree of absence of coating on the tongue.

     When The Pulse Is Rapid And The Tongue Is Not Red
   A Rapid pulse indicates Heat and this should be mirrored by a Red tongue. In
practice, quite often the pulse is Rapid but the tongue is not Red.
   Shock may be an explanation of this discrepancy because it often makes the pulse
Rapid but it does not cause redness of the tongue.
   Another explanation of this discrepancy is in cases when a person constantly
pushes himself or herself into working too much and too long hours; this causes the
heart to become dilated and then the Heart pulse is often Overflowing but Empty and
the pulse Rapid.

     When The Pulse Is Slow And The Tongue Is Red
   The most common explanation of this discrepancy is the practice of intense
exercise, especially jogging or running; this makes the pulse Slow. Because the
Slowness is due to the exercise and not to a true Cold pa ern, the tongue is not Pale
and may be Red from other reasons.
   Another possible explanation of a contradiction between a Slow pulse and a Red
tongue (and one that should always be kept in mind) is heart disease. A very Slow
pulse may often indicate some irregularities in heart conduction, especially if the
pulse is also irregular.

     Pulse Diagnosis Adds Detail To Tongue Diagnosis
   The pulse often adds detail to the findings from tongue diagnosis. For example, a
sticky yellow coating with red points on the root of the tongue indicates Damp-Heat
in the Lower Burner but it does not tell us whether this is in the Bladder, Intestines or
Uterus. The pulse would add detail to the information gleaned from the tongue
because Damp-Heat in the Bladder would manifest with a Slippery-Wiry quality on
the left Rear position, Damp-Heat in the Intestines with the same quality on both Rear
positions, while Damp-Heat in the Uterus would manifest with the same quality on
the Uterus position just proximal to the left Rear position.
   Another field in which the pulse adds detail to the tongue is that of Heart pa erns.
When the tongue has a deep central crack, this indicates the tendency to Heart
pa erns from emotional problems. However, it may also indicate the hereditary
tendency to actual heart problems. If the Heart pulse is Full and hard on the lateral
and medial positions of the Heart position (rolling the finger laterally and medially
very slightly), this indicates the possibility of an actual heart disease.
   Another situation in which the pulse adds detail to the findings from the tongue is
when the tongue is Purple, indicating Blood stasis. If the whole tongue is Purple, this
does not help us to pinpoint the organ aﬀected; the Wiry quality of the pulse in one or
other organ position helps us to pinpoint which organ is particularly aﬀected by
Blood stasis.
     LIMITATIONS OF PULSE DIAGNOSIS
   The main drawbacks of pulse diagnosis are its subjectivity and its being readily
aﬀected by short-term changes.

     It Is Subjective
   More than any other element of Chinese diagnosis, pulse diagnosis is rather
subjective, at least compared with other elements of diagnosis such as looking. For
example, there can be li le disagreement over whether a face is red or a tongue very
Red; such signs can also be seen objectively by diﬀerent observers. If, however, a pulse
is described as being Wiry, this is a purely subjective interpretation on the part of the
practitioner; it is impossible to ‘show' other observers how the pulse is Wiry and,
moreover, another practitioner might describe the same pulse as Slippery.

     It Is Subject To Short-Term Influences
   The pulse is easily and quickly influenced by short-term factors, at least when
compared with the tongue. For example, if a person has a sudden emotional upset,
this may make the pulse rapid but it will not change the tongue in the short term.
Likewise, the pulse is obviously aﬀected by exercise, becoming rapid, whereas the
tongue is not aﬀected by it. If a person works very hard for a week with li le sleep the
pulse will reflect this, immediately becoming quite weak and deep, but a single week
would not bring about a change in the tongue-body colour (though there are some
situations, such as in acute febrile diseases, when the tongue-body colour does change
rapidly).
   For these reasons, the integration of tongue and pulse diagnosis, as discussed
above, is absolutely crucial.

    PULSE QUALITIES INDICATING DANGEROUS CONDITIONS
    THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS ON THE PULSE

    INTRODUCTION
   The pulse ‘qualities' described in Chinese books over the centuries have
varied but they have been standardized today into 28 or 29 qualities. In theory,
there is no special reason why we should be restricted to using only those terms;
for example, there is no ‘Hard' pulse quality, but this is a term that often comes
to mind when feeling a particular pulse. However, it is important to train oneself
to use the set terminology of pulse qualities in order to establish a common
ground of communication among practitioners and between teachers and
students; for example, a practitioner or student might describe a pulse as
‘squidgy' in his or her own terminology (in fact, the term ‘squidgy' describes the
Soggy pulse quite well) but this would not be much use to other practitioners or
students.
   It cannot be stressed strongly enough that the pulse qualities, with their
description and clinical significance, should be memorized. Only by memorizing
the pulse qualities can students then communicate with the clinical teacher; only
when both the students and the clinical teacher are clear as to what a Wiry pulse
feels like and means, can they communicate with each other, and students
correlate the theoretical description of a Wiry pulse with their own feeling of the
pulse.

  FEELING AND IDENTIFYING THE PULSE
QUALITY
   It should be stressed that the pulse ‘quality' can be felt and identified only if
we move the fingers constantly by ‘rolling' them distally and proximally,
‘pushing' them medially and laterally, and ‘pressing' down and releasing
upwards as described in the previous chapter. We cannot feel and identify the
pulse quality if we keep the fingers absolutely still because the fingers need to
feel, probe and explore the shape and size of the pulse and this can be done only
by moving the fingers in all four directions around a given pulse position (i.e.
distally, proximally, medially and laterally). For example, we can deduce that a
pulse is Long or Short only if we gently roll the finger distally; we can deduce
that a pulse is Slippery only if we feel ‘around' it by moving the fingers medially
and laterally; we can deduce that a pulse is Floating-Empty only if we press the
fingers down and then release them to explore its depth.

          Remember: the pulse qualities cannot be felt by keeping the
      fingers absolutely still. The fingers must feel all around the pulse
      position, i.e. distally, proximally, medially, laterally and at
      diﬀerent levels.
   The pulse qualities discussed are as illustrated in Table 50.1 . The order in
which I have arranged these 29 pulse qualities is diﬀerent from that traditionally
used in Chinese books. The first 8 qualities are the traditional, basic ones, that is,
Floating, Deep, Slow, Rapid, Empty, Full, Slippery and Choppy. The other 21
qualities are arranged in three groups:

          • from 18 to 24: full-type qualities
          • from 25 to 29: qualities denoting rate or rhythm of pulse.
   In addition to the above 29 traditional qualities, I shall also discuss three new
qualities, mostly owed to Dr Shen' experience: Irregular, Stagnant, and Sad.
   For each pulse quality, I shall discuss the following:

          • pulse description
          • clinical significance
          • combinations
          • diﬀerentiation from similar pulses
          • clinical significance in each position according to Li Shi
      Zhen.
   I have paired the eight basic qualities (Floating/Deep, Slow/Rapid,
Full/Empty and Slippery/Choppy) each with its opposite. These pulse qualities
are considered to be the eight basic ones because they correspond closely to the
eight principles; that is, Floating and Deep correspond to Exterior and Interior,
Slow and Rapid to Cold and Heat, and Full and Empty to Excess and deficiency.
The Slippery and Choppy qualities are added to this group of eight basic
qualities because they are extremely common, the former indicating Phlegm or
Dampness and the la er Blood deficiency. These two pulse qualities are paired
also because to a certain extent they are at diﬀerent ends of a scale in terms of
how they feel under the finger.
   Box 50.1 summarizes the eight basic pulse qualities.

     THE EIGHT BASIC PULSE QUALITIES
Floating

     Pulse description
   This pulse is felt on very light pressure; in extreme cases it is felt with no
pressure at all. As its name implies, it has a ‘floating' quality and it is relatively
resistant to pressure. We can think of a large plank of wood in water: we can
push it down with some resistance but it comes back up. In other words, there is
a diﬀerence between a pulse that is felt clearly on the surface (as it should be if
Yang-Qi is normal) and a pulse that is Floating: the Floating pulse is more
resistant to finger pressure than a pulse that is normal at the superficial level.
Especially in summertime, it is normal for the pulse to be relatively more
superficial but that does not make it a Floating pulse. Bearing in mind the three
levels of the pulse as discussed in the previous chapter, the Floating pulse is felt
very clearly (and somewhat excessively) on the superficial level, which
corresponds to the Qi and Yang energies.
   The traditional description of a Floating pulse was like ‘feathers being ruﬄed
by the wind'. The ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' in Chapter 18 says: ‘ When the pulse is
Floating, it is felt moving above the muscle.' 1

     Clinical significance
   Generally speaking, the Floating pulse indicates the presence of a pathogenic
factor on the Exterior of the body: it is therefore associated with exterior
symptoms caused by invasion of Wind. Indeed, the presence of aversion to cold,
fever (or being hot to the touch) and a Floating pulse is enough to diagnose an
invasion of an external pathogenic factor. Thus the Floating pulse is one of the
main clinical signs of invasion of Wind. In fact, the ‘Discussion of Cold-induced
Diseases' says: ‘ A Floating pulse, stiﬀness and pain of the neck and aversion to
cold are signs of the Greater-Yang pa ern [invasion of Wind].' 2
   The reason that the pulse becomes floating in invasions of external
pathogenic factors is that when the body is a acked by external evils the
Defensive Qi is a racted to the surface of the body and the space between skin
and muscles, to fight the external pathogenic factors. Thus, the increased Yang-
Qi on the surface of the body is reflected in a more Yang pulse (i.e. Floating).
However, if the patient has weak Defensive Qi and does not react well to the
invasion of pathogenic factors, the pulse may not be Floating.
   The Floating pulse is not found only in exterior conditions but also occurs in
interior ones. I shall therefore discuss the clinical significance of the Floating
pulse, distinguishing between exterior and interior conditions; this will be done
under ‘Combinations'.
   Under the following conditions, a Floating pulse is normal and does not
indicate a pathology:

          • in an underweight person
          • in very hot weather.
   Box 50.2 summarizes the clinical significance of a Floating pulse.

          BOX 50.2        FLOATING PULSE: SUMMARY
      OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
          • Invasion of external Wind
          • Yin deficiency (interior conditions)
          • Organ disease (interior conditions)
          • Stomach prolapse (interior conditions)

     Combinations
   The clinical significance of the Floating pulse combined with other pulses
must be diﬀerentiated according to interior or exterior conditions.

     Exterior conditions
   In exterior conditions the pulse should be Floating by definition and is clearly
accompanied by exterior symptoms such as an aversion to cold and the presence
of fever. The Floating pulse of exterior conditions can be combined with other
qualities as follows.

     Floating-Full
   This indicates an External-Full condition, found when the patient has a
strong Defensive Qi.

     Floating-Weak
   This indicates an External-Empty condition, found when the patient has a
weak Defensive Qi that does not react properly to the invasion of external
pathogenic factors.

     Floating-Slow
   This indicates an invasion of Wind-Cold with a prevalence of Wind.

     Floating-Tight
   This indicates an invasion of Wind-Cold with a prevalence of Cold.

     Floating-Empty
   This indicates an invasion of Summer-Heat; it is more floating than the
Floating-Empty pulse from Yin deficiency.

     Floating-Slippery
   This indicates an invasion of Wind-Damp or Wind complicated by Phlegm.

     Interior conditions
   The Floating pulse can be found in interior conditions and it is, indeed,
relatively common. In interior conditions, exterior symptoms such as an aversion
to cold and the presence of fever are obviously absent. Thus, if we feel a Floating
pulse, we should first establish whether the patient' condition is exterior or
interior; this is easily done because an exterior condition presents with an acute
onset of aversion to cold, fever, body aches, sore throat, etc. In the absence of
such symptoms the condition is interior and we must therefore interpret the
significance of the Floating pulse diﬀerently.
   The Floating quality of the pulse in interior conditions is not as pronounced
as in exterior ones; in exterior conditions the pulse is clearly floating like a piece
of wood in water as described above and is rather resistant to pressure, whereas
in interior conditions the Floating quality of the pulse is less pronounced and is
not so resistant to pressure.

            The Floating quality of the pulse in interior conditions is not as
         pronounced as in exterior ones.
   A Floating pulse in an interior condition associated with an emptiness at the
deep level of the pulse generally indicates a potentially serious problem often
with severe Blood, Yin or Essence deficiency. Thus, a relatively Floating pulse
that is Empty at the deep level in interior conditions may be associated with
anaemia, chronic asthma, cirrhosis of the liver or cancer.
   In addition, if the pulse is generally Weak and Deep but Floating in one
particular position, there may be a problem (often organic rather than just
energetic) with the organ corresponding to that position. For example, if the
pulse is generally Weak and Deep in all positions except in the Heart position,
where it is Floating, this may indicate heart disease.
   The Floating pulse without strength in interior conditions may also be
associated with prolapse of the stomach, in which case the pulse would also be
Fine or Soggy.
   Box 50.3 summarizes Western conditions that may be indicated by a Floating
pulse.

             BOX 50.3       WESTERN DISEASES
         POTENTIALLY INDICATED BY A FLOATING
         PULSE
            • Floating-Empty: anaemia, chronic asthma, cirrhosis of the
         liver, cancer
            • Floating in one position but Deep-Weak in all others:
         potential disease in that organ
            • Floating-Fine or Floating-Soggy: prolapse of the stomach
   If, in the absence of exterior symptoms, the pulse is Floating in all positions
and, although it feels relatively hard on the superficial level, it disappears on
pressure, this indicates that the person is overworking and pushing himself or
herself to the limit; Dr Shen calls this condition ‘Qi wild'.
   The clinical significance of the Floating pulse in interior conditions needs to
be interpreted according to its combinations as follows.

     Floating-Empty
   This is a relatively common pulse in interior conditions and it indicates Yin
deficiency. The Floating-Empty pulse is felt clearly and easily on the superficial
level with very light pressure but, with a deeper pressure, the pulse feels empty.
However, the Floating-Empty pulse is not as floating as the Floating pulse of
exterior conditions.
   The emptiness of the pulse at the deep level clearly reflects the deficiency of
Yin. On the other hand, its floating quality at the superficial level reflects the
rising Yang that derives from Yin deficiency. The Floating-Empty pulse reflects a
relatively advanced condition of Yin deficiency when this gives rise to Floating
Yang and possibly Empty-Heat. There are of course other pulse qualities that
may indicate Yin deficiency such as Fine, Leather or Minute.

     Floating-Choppy
   This indicates severe Blood deficiency. What is the diﬀerence in the clinical
significance between a Choppy pulse (which also indicates Blood deficiency) and
a Floating-Choppy pulse? The la er indicates a more serious condition of Blood
deficiency to such an extent that there is some Empty-Heat associated with it.
Thus a woman with a Floating-Choppy pulse who is suﬀering from Blood
deficiency may experience a feeling of heat in the face owing to Empty-Heat
arising from Blood deficiency; this occurs only in women.

     Floating-Hollow
   This pulse appears after a haemorrhage. If it is also Rapid, however, it may
indicate a forthcoming haemorrhage.

     Floating-Short
   This indicates severe deficiency of Qi.

     Floating-Rapid
   This indicates a serious condition of severe exhaustion (Xu Lao ). Of course,
this applies only if the Floating-Rapid pulse occurs in interior conditions; in the
presence of exterior symptoms, of course, it indicates an invasion of Wind-Heat
and its clinical significance is therefore completely diﬀerent.

     Floating-Slippery-Rapid
   This indicates long-term retention of Phlegm-Heat usually in the Lungs and
is seen in chronic bronchitis.

     Floating-Weak
   This indicates Yin deficiency.

     Differentiation of similar pulse qualities

     Soggy
   The Soggy pulse is soft, without strength, diﬃcult to feel at the superficial
level and comparable with wet co on wool, whereas the Floating pulse is easily
felt at the superficial level and, although it decreases in strength when pressed
harder, it is not as soft as the Soggy pulse. However, in interior conditions, the
combined Floating-Weak pulse feels very similar to the Soggy pulse.

     Clinical significance in each position (Li Shi Zhen)

     Front position
   This indicates invasion of external Wind with dizziness and headache, or
invasion of Wind-Heat with mucus in the chest.

     Middle position
   This indicates deficiency of the Spleen with excess of the Liver.

     Rear position
   This is seen in diﬃculty in urination and defecation.

     Deep
Pulse description
   The Deep pulse can be felt only at the middle and deep levels, and especially
the la er. It feels as if it were sunken underneath the muscle. It was also
described in the old books as ‘a stone in the water'.
   The depth at which the pulse is felt needs to be correlated with the body
build of the patient; obviously, in obese patients, the pulse will be deeper. Thus
the description of the Deep pulse is relative: what feels deep in a thin person
may be normal in an obese person.

     Clinical significance
   This pulse quality indicates simply that the condition is an interior one. A
further interpretation of the clinical significance of this pulse must be based on
the diﬀerentiation between a Deep-Full and a Deep-Weak pulse.

     Deep-Full
   The Deep-Full pulse denotes the presence of a pathogenic factor in the
Interior: this could be Cold, Heat, retention of food, stagnation of Qi or Blood, or
accumulation of Water, depending on the combination with other pulse
qualities.

     Deep-Weak
   The Deep-Weak pulse quality indicates Yang deficiency and it is very
common.
   Box 50.4 summarizes the clinical significance of a Deep pulse.
            BOX 50.4       DEEP PULSE: SUMMARY OF
       CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
           • Pathogenic factor in the Interior (Deep-Full)
           • Yang deficiency (Deep-Weak)

     Combinations

     Deep-Weak
    A very common pulse quality, this indicates Yang deficiency. This pulse is
felt at the deep level with moderate pressure and it feels weak.

     Deep-Wiry
    This indicates stasis of Blood and a possible pathology of the Penetrating
Vessel.

     Deep-Wiry-Slow
    This indicates Blood stasis deriving from Cold, or stagnation of Cold in the
Liver channel.

     Deep-Slow
    This denotes interior Cold.

     Deep-Rapid
    This indicates interior Heat.

     Deep-Soggy-Slow
    This denotes Dampness in the Interior, frequently with oedema.

     Differentiation of similar pulses

     Hidden
    The Hidden pulse, essentially the same as the Deep pulse, is an extreme case
of it. The Deep pulse is sunken underneath the muscle and can be felt clearly
with strong pressure, whereas the Hidden pulse is sunken near the bone and is
diﬃcult to feel even with strong pressure.

     Firm
    The Firm pulse is a type of Deep pulse in so far as it can be felt only at the
deep level. It is essentially a pulse that is Wiry at the deep level (the Wiry pulse is
felt at all levels).

     Clinical significance in each position (Li Shi Zhen)

     Front position
      This indicates Phlegm or Phlegm-Fluids stagnating in the chest.

       Middle position
      This indicates pain from Cold in the Middle Burner.

       Rear position
      This is seen in white spermatorrhoea and diarrhoea or lumbago from Kidney
deficiency and abdominal pain.

       Slow
Pulse description
      In antiquity, the pulse was defined as slow in relation to the breathing cycles
of the doctor. Thus a pulse was described as slow if it beat three times or less
during the time it takes the doctor to breathe in and out, and as rapid if it beat
five times or more during the same time. Obviously this method relies on the
doctor' being in good health: it would not work if the doctor suﬀered from
asthma! Although this method is not used any longer, the concentration on one'
own breathing focuses and relaxes the doctor' mind.
      In modern times, the definition of a Slow or Rapid pulse is related to the
pulse rate, which must be correlated to the age of the patient as follows:

Age   Rate
0-1   120/140
1-3   110
4-10 84/90
11-15 78/80
16-35 76
36-50 72/70
50+   68

      Any pulse rate below the above values is therefore a Slow pulse. Of course
these values should not be adhered to rigidly: for example, a pulse rate of 74
b.p.m. in the 16—35 years age range would be only very slightly slow and have
no clinical significance.

       Clinical significance
      A Slow pulse almost always indicates a Cold pa ern. A diﬀerent
interpretation of a Slow pulse is that it denotes a problem in the Yin organs, as
opposed to the Rapid pulse, which indicates a problem in the Yang organs;
however, this is a broad generalization and it is not that clinically relevant. The
‘Classic of Diﬃculties' in Chapter 9 says, ‘Rapid pulse indicates problems in the
Yang organs, the Slow pulse problems in the Yin organs '. 3
      The clinical significance of the Slow pulse depends on whether it is Full or
Empty: a Slow and Full pulse indicates Full-Cold, whereas a Slow and Empty
pulse indicates Empty-Cold deriving from Yang deficiency. A condition of Full-
Cold can last only a relatively short time (a ma er of weeks or months) as
interior Cold will eventually injure Yang and lead to Yang deficiency and
therefore Empty-Cold. For this reason, in clinical practice Empty-Cold is more
common than Full-Cold because we generally see patients with chronic
conditions.
   If the pulse is very slow, beating only twice for each breath cycle, it is called a
Harmful pulse; if it beats only once per each breath, it is called the Destroyed
pulse. Both these pulses, and especially the second one, indicate extreme
depletion of the Internal Organs and are always associated with serious
conditions.

    Common Cold conditions manifesting with a Slow pulse
   Common conditions which present with a Slow pulse are Stomach-Qi
deficiency,    Spleen-Yang    deficiency,    Heart-Yang     deficiency,    Kidney-Yang
deficiency, deficiency of Gathering Qi (Zong Qi ), Lung-Yang deficiency, Cold in
the Stomach, Cold in the Uterus, abdominal masses, Cold-Phlegm and Damp-
Cold.
   A Slow pulse in chronic conditions may also indicate a deficiency of the
Original Qi (Yuan Qi ).
   Box 50.5 summarizes the clinical significance of a Slow pulse.

          BOX 50.5        CONDITIONS COMMONLY
        MANIFESTING WITH A SLOW PULSE
         • Stomach-Qi deficiency
         • Spleen-Yang deficiency
         • Heart-Yang deficiency
         • Kidney-Yang deficiency
         • deficiency of Gathering Qi (Zong Qi )
         • Lung-Yang deficiency
         • Cold in the Stomach
         • Cold in the Uterus
         • Abdominal masses
         • Cold-Phlegm
         • Damp-Cold

   Contradictory manifestations characterized by a Slow pulse
and Heat symptoms
   Very occasionally the Slow pulse occurs in combination with Heat symptoms;
one of the reasons for this contradiction may be Damp-Heat as the Dampness
itself may slow the pulse down.
   Of course, a contradiction between a Slow pulse and Heat symptoms may
simply be due to the coexistence of Cold and Heat pa erns. For example, the
combination of Kidney-Yang deficiency with Damp-Heat in the Bladder is
relatively common. Another possible common combination is that of Kidney-
Yang deficiency with Liver-Yang rising.
   In menopausal women, a simultaneous deficiency of Kidney-Yin and Kidney-
Yang is very common; if the Kidney-Yang deficiency is more pronounced the
pulse may be Slow, but the Kidney-Yin deficiency will cause some Empty-Heat
signs such as hot flushes and night sweating.
   In the context of acute febrile diseases of the Warm-Disease type, the pulse
can be Slow with the pa ern of Damp-Heat at the Defensive-Qi level.
   A Slow pulse with Heat symptoms may also indicate the condition of True
Cold and False Heat, but this is quite rare. Yet another possible explanation of a
Slow pulse with Heat symptoms is when the Heat is so intense that it obstructs
the circulation of Qi and makes the pulse Slow; however, this is also quite rare.
   Box 50.6 summarizes conditions with contradictory pulse and Heat
symptoms.

          BOX 50.6        SITUATIONS GIVING RISE TO
      CONTRADICTORY SLOW PULSE AND HEAT
      SYMPTOMS
         • Damp-Heat
         • Coexistence of Cold and Heat pa erns
         • Simultaneous deficiency of Kidney-Yin and Kidney-Yang
      (with predominance of the la er)
         • Damp-Heat at the Defensive-Qi level in Warm diseases
         • True Cold and false Heat
         • Intense Heat obstructing the circulation of Qi

    The Slow pulse and jogging
   Dr Shen relates a Slow pulse always to a Heart disharmony and poor
circulation and, paradoxically, it is often seen in people who jog a lot: according
to Dr Shen, excessive jogging (in his opinion more than 4 miles a day) leads to a
dilation of the blood vessels which eventually becomes permanent and therefore
slows the circulation down so that the pulse becomes Slow.
   A Slow pulse is relatively common in Western patients who are joggers.
Indeed, when we feel a Slow pulse, the first question we should ask is whether
the patient jogs regularly. However, this is not necessarily a ‘false' sign that
should be discounted because it reflects the fact that excessive jogging injures
Yang and leads to internal Cold. Therefore, although the Slow pulse should be
taken into consideration, it is important also to bear in mind that it may be
‘disguising' the presence of Heat.

   Situations which may cause a Slow pulse without involving
Heat
   The following life situations may cause a Slow pulse:
          • old age
          • childbirth
          • excessive consumption of fa y and sweet foods.
   A Slow pulse of course appears when a patient is on beta blockers; in this
case it is a false sign and can be ignored.

     Combinations

     Slow-Floating
   This indicates invasion of exterior Wind-Cold with a prevalence of Wind.

     Slow-Deep
   This indicates interior Cold (which may be Full or Empty according to
whether the pulse is Full or Empty).

     Slow-Slippery
   This denotes Cold Phlegm or Damp-Cold.

     Slow-Choppy
   This indicates Blood deficiency and interior Cold deriving from it. (A Slow-
Slippery pulse indicates a pathology of Qi, whereas a Slow-Choppy pulse
indicates a pathology of Blood.)

     Slow-Weak
   This denotes Empty-Cold with Yang deficiency.

     Slow-Full
   This denotes internal Cold and is often seen in chronic, painful conditions.

     Slow-Wiry
   This indicates accumulation of Phlegm-Fluids or stagnation of Cold in the
Liver channel.

     Slow-Deep-Weak
   This may indicate Heart-Yang deficiency with symptoms of cold limbs, cold
feeling, sweating and depression.

     Slow-Tight-Overflowing
   This indicates that the blood vessels are dilated: in a young person this is
often due to excessive jogging, whereas in the elderly it may indicate hardening
of the blood vessels.

     Differentiation of similar pulses

     Slowed-Down
   This pulse has four beats per breathing cycle, whereas the Slow pulse has
three beats or less.

     Knotted
   This pulse is slow and it stops at irregular intervals, whereas the Slow pulse
is regular.

     Clinical significance in each position (Li Shi Zhen)

     Front position
   This indicates deficiency and Cold in the Upper Burner.

     Middle position
   This is seen in pain from Cold in the Middle Burner.

     Rear position
   This is seen in backache and leg ache with a feeling of heaviness from Kidney
deficiency.

     Rapid
Pulse description
   The Rapid pulse has six beats or more to each breathing cycle; in modern
clinical practice a pulse is defined as being Rapid when it beats more times than
the values indicated under the Slow pulse above. For example, a pulse rate of 82
b.p.m. in the age range 16—35 indicates a Rapid pulse.

     Clinical significance
   The Rapid pulse always indicates Heat, which may be Full or Empty
according to whether the pulse is Full or Empty. Typical examples of a pulse that
is Rapid and of the Full-type are Rapid-Wiry, indicating Liver-Fire, or Rapid-
Slippery, indicating Phlegm-Fire.
   Examples of a pulse that is Rapid and of the Empty-type are Rapid-Fine,
indicating Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat, or Rapid and Floating-Empty, also
indicating Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat. It is important to stress that, in Yin
deficiency, a Rapid pulse indicates the presence of Empty-Heat rather than Yin
deficiency itself; this is manifested by the pulse being either Fine or Floating-
Empty. This is equivalent to the situation in tongue diagnosis when, in Yin
deficiency, a Red tongue body indicates the presence of Empty-Heat rather than
the presence of Yin deficiency itself, which would be manifested by the absence
of coating.

          Yin deficiency is indicated by a Floating-Empty pulse; it is only
      when it is also Rapid that Empty-Heat is indicated.
   As mentioned above under the Slow pulse, the ‘Classic of Diﬃculties' relates
the Rapid pulse to problems of the Yang organs, and the Slow pulse to problems
of the Yin organs. Of course, this is a broad generalization which suﬀers from
exceptions (e.g. Liver-Fire may manifest with a Rapid pulse).
   Common conditions which present with a Rapid pulse include Stomach-
Heat, Heat in the Intestines, Lung-Heat, Liver-Fire, Heart-Fire, Yin deficiency
with Empty-Heat, Phlegm-Heat, Damp-Heat and invasion of Wind-Heat. The
Rapid pulse is also seen in the Lilium Syndrome described in Chapter 3 of the
‘Synopsis of Prescriptions from the Golden Cabinet'. 4
   Box 50.7 summarizes the common clinical manifestations of a Rapid pulse.

           BOX 50.7          COMMON CONDITIONS
       MANIFESTING WITH A RAPID PULSE
           • Stomach-Heat
           • Heat in the Large Intestine
           • Lung-Heat
           • Liver-Fire
           • Heart-Fire
           • Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat
           • Phlegm-Heat
           • Damp-Heat
           • Invasion of Wind-Heat
           • Lilium Syndrome
   In fevers, whether of internal or external origin, the pulse should be Rapid; if
it is not, this is a serious sign.

           In fevers, if the pulse is not Rapid this is a bad sign.
   However, there are a few situations when a Rapid pulse does not indicate
Heat because the clinical manifestations do not point to Heat. When we feel a
Rapid pulse, it is important to check this against the tongue and the inside of the
lower eyelids: in true conditions of Heat, the tongue will be Red and the inside of
the lower eyelids will also be red.
   The following are examples of situations when the Rapid pulse does not
correspond to Heat.

           • The pulse can become Rapid following an emotional upset
       , such as a shock or an outburst of anger. Thus if we see a patient
       whose clinical manifestations do not point to Heat and the pulse is
       Rapid, we should always ask whether they have had an emotional
       upset recently (within hours or days). The ‘Simple Questions', in
       Chapter 17 , says, ‘A Rapid pulse may indicate that a person has
suﬀered a sudden fright and the pulse will revert back to normal in
three to four days.' 5
   • The pulse can become Rapid when a person suﬀering from
Qi and Blood deficiency works very hard, pushing himself or
herself to the limit. In such a case the pulse becomes Rapid
manifesting an a empt by the body' Qi to cope with such
demands: Dr J. H. F. Shen describes this situation as ‘Qi wild'
when the pulse is also Overflowing. The ‘Complete Book of Jing
Yue' confirms this by saying that one of the causes of a Rapid
pulse may be exhaustion (Xu Lao ). 6 If the pulse is Rapid and Big
but also Empty, this may indicate severe exhaustion of Essence
and Blood which occur also without Empty-Heat.
   • The pulse can become Rapid in advanced cases of cancer ,
even in the absence of a Heat pa ern. In a patient suﬀering from
cancer this is often a bad sign indicating a poor prognosis and,
potentially, a rapid spread of the cancer.
   • The pulse can become Rapid in extreme Qi deficiency ,
again reflecting an a empt by the body' Qi to cope with its
demands.
   • The pulse can become Rapid in Yin Fire. The concept of Yin
Fire was introduced by Li Dong Yuan in his famous ‘Discussion on
Stomach and Spleen' (Pi Wei Lun , 1249). According to Li Dong
Yuan irregular diet, overwork and emotional stress weaken the
Stomach and Spleen and the Original Qi (Yuan Qi ). When the
Original Qi declines, the Minister Fire becomes pathological and
rises from the space between the Kidneys to harass the Heart and
Pericardium; Li Dong Yuan called this Yin Fire (not to be confused
with Empty-Heat). The pathological Minister Fire (i.e. Yin Fire)
‘displaces' the Original Qi because they both occupy the same
space in between the Kidneys; for this reason Li Dong Yuan says
that the Yin Fire is a ‘thief' of the Original Qi. Thus in this kind of
pathology there may be some Cold symptoms and signs arising
from a deficiency of the Original Qi (such as cold feet, a feeling of
cold and a Pale tongue) and some Heat manifestations from the
rising of the Yin Fire (such as a feeling of heat in the face and a
Rapid pulse). Arousal of the Yin Fire is treated not by clearing
Heat but by tonifying the Original Qi with sweet and warm herbs;
the representative formula for this is Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang
Tonifying the Centre and Benefiting Qi Decoction (Tonify Qi and Ease
the Muscles in the Three Treasures ).
      As Yin Fire derives from a deficiency of the Original Qi, if
the la er predominates, the pulse may be Slow rather than Rapid.
         • A Rapid pulse may also simply indicate nervous tension
      without any Heat. This is usually found in people who are
      constitutionally nervous: these patients will most probably have a
      Heart crack on the tongue.
   Box 50.8 summarizes those situations when a Rapid pulse does not
correspond to Heat.

         BOX 50.8         SITUATIONS WHEN THE PULSE
      IS RAPID FOR REASONS OTHER THAN HEAT
         • Emotional upset
         • Severe Qi and Blood deficiency from overwork
         • Cancer
         • Extreme Qi deficiency
         • Yin Fire
         • Nervous tension
   The following factors may also cause the pulse to become temporarily Rapid
in the absence of Heat: vigorous physical exercise, heavy meals, alcohol,
smoking, tea, coﬀee, fright, emotional upsets, certain herbs such as Ma Huang
Ephedrae sinicae or Ren Shen Radix Panax Ginseng and anaemia.

    Combinations

    Rapid-Full
   This indicates the presence of Full-Heat from Excess of Yang.

    Rapid-Empty
   This indicates Empty-Heat from deficiency of Yin.

    Rapid-Floating
   This denotes invasion of external Wind-Heat.

    Rapid-Deep
   This indicates interior Heat.

    Rapid-Overflowing
   This indicates Full-Heat usually in the Stomach, Lungs or Heart.

    Rapid-Fine
   This denotes Empty-Heat from Yin deficiency.

    Rapid-Floating-Empty
   This indicates Empty-Heat from Yin deficiency.

    Rapid-Wiry
   This indicates Liver-Fire.

     Rapid-Slippery
   This denotes Phlegm-Heat.

     Rapid-Deep-Full
   This indicates interior Fire in the Stomach and the Intestines.

     Rapid-Wiry-Big
   This indicates Blood-Heat. According to Dr Shen, this pulse may be seen
when there is too much glucose or cholesterol in the blood.

     Differentiation of similar pulses

     Hasty
   The Hasty pulse is rapid and stops at irregular intervals, whereas the Rapid
pulse is regular.

     Hurried
   The Hurried pulse beats seven to eight times per breath cycle, it is regular
and it gives the sensation of being hurried and anxious. It feels extremely
agitated and urgent.

     Moving
   The Moving pulse is rapid and short, it is shaped like a bean and gives the
impression of vibrating rather than pulsating. The Rapid pulse is simply rapid
and does not have any of the above a ributes.

     Clinical significance in each position (Li Shi Zhen)

     Front position
   This is found in sore throat, tongue or mouth ulcers, vomiting of blood,
cough and lung abcess.

     Middle position
   This indicates Stomach-Fire if on the right Middle position, and Liver-Fire if
on the left Middle position.

     Rear position
   This indicates the need to nourish the Yin and clear Fire.

     Empty
Pulse description
   The Empty pulse has no strength and disappears with a light pressure,
feeling empty; it is soft but also relatively big and distended at the superficial
level.

     Clinical significance
   The Empty pulse indicates Qi deficiency at its beginning or middle stages; in
chronic Qi deficiency, the Empty pulse will usually become Weak (see below).
Since most of the patients we see suﬀer from chronic conditions, the classic
Empty pulse is relatively rare. When discussing the clinical significance of the
‘Empty' pulse, it is important to be precise about one' terminology: there is a
diﬀerence between the classic ‘Empty' pulse as defined above, indicating purely
Qi deficiency, and an empty-type pulse, which encompasses a broad range of
deficient pulses, such as Weak, Fine, Choppy, etc. It is therefore important,
especially in training clinics, not to use the word ‘Empty' in a loose sense but
only to indicate a precise pulse quality.

            Remember: do not confuse the specific ‘Empty' pulse quality
         with a generic, loosely defined ‘empty-type' of pulse.
   The Empty pulse is most common on the Lung position and in chronic
conditions it may indicate Lung exhaustion (Fei Xu Lao ).
   If the pulse is Empty and relatively Floating and without strength in all three
positions, especially of the left, it indicates Blood deficiency.
   If the pulse is Empty and slightly Rapid in acute exterior syndromes, it
indicates invasion of Summer-Heat.
   Box 50.9 summarizes the clinical significance of an Empty pulse.

            BOX 50.9         EMPTY PULSE: SUMMARY OF
         CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
            • Qi deficiency
            • Blood deficiency (slightly Floating)
            • Summer-Heat (slightly Rapid)

     Combinations

     Empty-Floating without strength
   This indicates Blood deficiency.

     Empty-Rapid
   In exterior syndromes this may denote invasion of Summer-Heat. In interior
syndromes it may indicate the rising of Yin Fire from a deficiency of Original Qi
as described above under the Rapid pulse.

     Differentiation of similar pulses
    Weak
   The Weak pulse is slightly deeper than the Empty pulse and therefore
requires a slightly harder finger pressure and it lacks the relatively big and
distended quality of the Empty pulse; it is also softer than the Empty pulse.

    Choppy
   The Choppy pulse is deeper than the Empty pulse, it lacks its relatively big
and distended quality, it is weaker than the Empty pulse and it lacks a wave. By
contrast, the Empty pulse has a wave. The Choppy pulse also feels ‘jagged',
whereas the Empty pulse feels quite rounded.

    Hollow
   The Hollow pulse is empty only at the middle level and can be felt at the
superficial and deep levels; the Empty pulse is empty at the superficial level and
is softer than the Hollow pulse.

    Soggy
   The Soggy pulse is soft and without strength but also slightly floating,
whereas the Empty pulse is bigger and not floating.

    Clinical significance in each position (Li Shi Zhen)

    Front position
   This indicates deficient Blood not nourishing the Heart.

    Middle position
   This is found in abdominal distension, retention of food and Qi stagnation.

    Rear position
   This indicates Atrophy or Painful Obstruction Syndrome from steaming of
the bones injuring Essence and Blood with deficiency in the Lower Burner.

    Full
Pulse description
   The Full pulse feels hard, full and long; it is felt easily at all levels and it has a
springy quality resistant to finger pressure.

    Clinical significance
   The Full pulse simply indicates the presence of a Full pa ern; its precise
clinical significance can be deduced only from its combination with other
qualities. When discussing the clinical significance of the ‘Full' pulse, it is
important to be precise about terminology: there is a diﬀerence between the
classic ‘Full' pulse as defined above, indicating purely a Full condition, and a
full-type pulse, which encompasses a broad range of full pulses, such as Wiry,
Slippery, Tight, Big, Overflowing, etc. It is therefore important, especially in
training clinics, not to use the word ‘Full' in a loose sense but only to indicate a
precise pulse quality.
   A proper identification of the Full pulse is essential to determine the correct
principle of treatment in chronic conditions which are usually characterized by
the simultaneous presence of Full and Empty pa erns. In such cases, we must
have a clear idea in mind as to what our treatment strategy should be, that is,
tonify the body' Qi or expel pathogenic factors. When we are confronted by
these alternative treatment strategies, the pulse quality is extremely important in
our deciding which one to choose; if the pulse is Full it is usually be er to
concentrate our a ention on expelling pathogenic factors, even if the condition is
chronic. Postviral fatigue syndrome is a case in point. In this condition there is
nearly always deficiency, usually of Qi, and Excess, usually of Dampness, and I
often base my decision whether to tonify Qi or resolve Dampness on the pulse
quality: if it is Full or of the full type, I start by resolving Dampness rather than
tonifying Qi. The same principle applies to any chronic conditions manifesting
with simultaneous deficiency and Excess.
   Box 50.10 summarizes the common conditions presenting with a Full pulse.

          BOX 50.10          COMMON CONDITIONS
      MANIFESTING WITH A FULL PULSE

     Differentiation of similar pulses

     Overflowing
   The Overflowing pulse is large, long and relatively floating and it decreases
in strength when pressed heavily. The Full pulse is not so long, not so floating
and does not decrease in strength when pressed heavily.

     Clinical significance in each position (Li Shi Zhen)

     Front position
   This is found in invasion of Wind-Heat in the head and face, sore throat, stiﬀ
tongue and a feeling of fullness in the chest.

     Middle position
   This is found in Heat in the Spleen, abdominal distension and fullness.

     Rear position
   This is found in backache, abdominal pain and constipation.

     Slippery
Pulse description
   The Slippery pulse feels slippery or ‘oily': it is rounded, ‘slips' or slides under
the finger and flows smoothly. In ancient times, it was described as feeling like
‘pearls rolling in a basin' or ‘raindrops rolling on a lotus leaf'. Students can get a
good idea of what a Slippery pulse is by feeling the pulse of a pregnant woman
in an advanced stage of pregnancy; most probably, the pulse will be very
Slippery (if it is not, this is a bad sign).

     Clinical significance
   The Slippery pulse indicates primarily Phlegm or retention of food; it may
also indicate Blood stasis. Generally speaking, the Slippery pulse is full by
definition indicating the presence of Phlegm; however, it may also be combined
with empty-type pulses reflecting the simultaneous deficiency of Qi and the
presence of Phlegm (which usually derive from Qi deficiency).
   Although the Slippery pulse is traditionally associated with Phlegm, it may
also be seen in cases of chronic Dampness; for example, it is very common in
chronic cases of postviral fatigue syndrome with clear manifestations of
Dampness.
   It is normal for the pulse to become Slippery during pregnancy and, indeed,
it indicates a healthy pregnancy. Conversely, if the pulse is not Slippery during
pregnancy, it is not a good sign and it may indicate impending problems; in such
cases, the woman should be treated even in the absence of symptoms. In
particular, there are certain pulse qualities which are undesirable during
pregnancy, such as Choppy, Choppy-Wiry, Fine, Weak, Leather and Hollow, all
of which may indicate the possibility of miscarriage.
   According to some Chinese sources, a Slippery pulse that is Slowed-Down
and relatively soft indicates health.
   Common conditions manifesting with a Slippery pulse include a whole range
of diseases characterized by Phlegm in all of its manifestations (i.e. Phlegm-Heat,
Cold-Phlegm, Damp-Phlegm, Wind-Phlegm, etc.). In the organs, Phlegm can be
retained primarily in the Lungs, Stomach and Heart (non-substantial Phlegm
misting the Mind). Phlegm in the Lungs is extremely common and a good
example of a Slippery pulse is that felt in a patient with acute or chronic
bronchitis.
   Conditions other than Phlegm, such as Damp-Heat or retention of food, may
also lead to a Slippery pulse.
   According to Dr Shen, when a Slippery quality is felt only in one position, it
does not necessarily indicate Dampness or Phlegm. For example, he a ributes
the following clinical significance to a Slippery quality in individual positions:

          • Lungs: Phlegm
          • Stomach: excessive acidity
          • Bladder: disturbance of bladder function
          • Heart: heart-valve problem
          • Liver: disturbance of liver function
          • Gall-Bladder: gallstones
          • Kidney: kidney infection.

   Li Shi Zhen summarizes the combinations of Slippery pulses as follows:

         • Slippery-Floating: Wind-Phlegm
         • Slippery-Deep: Phlegm with retention of food
         • Slippery-Rapid: Phlegm-Fire
         • Slippery-Slow: retention of food.

    Differentiation of similar pulses

    Moving
   The Moving pulse is rounded like the Slippery pulse but it is also short, is
shaped like a bean and gives the impression of vibrating rather than pulsating.

    Soggy
   The Soggy pulse is very slightly slippery, as well as being soft and relatively
floating. The Slippery pulse is much fuller than the Soggy pulse and is not soft.

    Clinical significance in each position (Li Shi Zhen)

    Front position
   This is found in Phlegm in the chest or diaphragm, vomiting, vomiting of
sour fluids, stiﬀ tongue and cough.

    Middle position
   This indicates retention of food or Heat in the Spleen and Liver.

    Rear position
   This is found in diabetes, diarrhoea, hernia and Painful Urination Syndrome.
     Choppy
Pulse description
   The Choppy pulse feels rough, ‘jagged' and short. It flows without a ‘wave',
the normal pulse flows from the Rear position to the Front with a smooth and
continuous movement like a sea wave. The Choppy pulse lacks this continuous
movement between the three positions and does not feel like a wave; this is an
important diﬀerence from a normal pulse as the Choppy pulse is felt within each
position separately (Fig. 50.1 ).
                                   IF rnnt          Middle-

                             =                      Normal

                                                    Choppy
      FIG. 50.1   The Choppy pulse quality in relation to a wave
   For this reason, when deciding whether or not a pulse is Choppy, it is
important to feel the pulse with three fingers to detect the presence or absence of
the wave between the three positions. However, this does not mean that the
pulse may not be Choppy in one position only.

          The      Choppy        pulse       must    be       felt   with   three   fingers
      simultaneously.
   There are many other ways of describing the Choppy pulse. First, it appears
to be flowing vertically up and down rather than horizontally. It also gives the
impression of coming and going, of being stagnant and not flowing properly.
One description is ‘the throb of the beat arrives but not all at once; it falls away
but not immediately'. Another characteristic of the Choppy pulse is that it may
appear to change quality and strength as we feel it.
   In ancient times it was described as ‘a knife scraping bamboo' or ‘raindrops
in the sand'. Some Chinese books describe this pulse as a ‘three-five pulse'
meaning that it changes rate frequently, sometimes beating three times and
sometimes five times per respiration. Other authors say that the Choppy pulse
combines three qualities: it is Slow, Fine and Short.
   Box 50.12 summarizes these descriptions of a Choppy pulse.

           BOX 50.12              DESCRIPTIONS OF THE
      CHOPPY PULSE QUALITY

          • Raindrops in the sand
          • Changes rate frequently
          • It is a combination of three qualities: Slow, Fine and Short

     Clinical significance
   The Choppy pulse indicates a deficiency of Blood or Essence. It may also
indicate loss of Body Fluids occurring after profuse sweating, vomiting or
diarrhoea. In a pregnant woman, a Choppy pulse is always a bad sign, at the
beginning of term indicating the possibility of miscarriage and towards the end
of term indicating the possibility of eclampsia. In men, a Choppy pulse indicates
deficiency of Essence, which may derive from excessive sexual activity.
   Besides Blood deficiency, the Choppy pulse may also indicate Blood stasis
but only when this occurs against a background of deficiency of Qi or Blood.
   Generally speaking, the Choppy pulse is, of course, by definition of the
empty type. However, although the Choppy pulse is short, rough, jagged and
lacking a wave, it can also be relatively Full. The word ‘relatively' is important in
the description of this pulse combination, as the Choppy-Full pulse is not nearly
as full as the Full pulse. The Choppy and relatively Full pulse often indicates
Blood stasis rather than Blood deficiency, frequently deriving from emotional
problems.
   The Choppy pulse generally indicates the pa erns of Blood deficiency
(especially in women), Essence deficiency (especially in men) and Blood stasis.
Common conditions presenting with these pa erns and a Choppy pulse include
heart disease, Chest Painful Obstruction Syndrome, many menstrual disorders,
postnatal disorders such as depression, and cancer.
   Box 50.13 summarizes the clinical significance of a Choppy pulse.

     EMPTY-TYPE PULSES
Weak

     Pulse description
   As the Weak pulse cannot be felt at the superficial level it is, by definition,
Deep. It feels soft and without strength. When discussing the clinical significance
of the ‘Weak' pulse, it is important to be precise about one' terminology: there is
a diﬀerence between the classic ‘Weak' pulse as defined above, indicating purely
Yang deficiency, and a weak-type pulse that encompasses a broad range of
deficient pulses, such as Empty, Fine, Choppy, Soggy, etc. It is therefore
important, especially in training clinics, to use the word ‘Weak' not in a loose
sense but only to indicate a precise pulse quality.

           The Weak pulse is not just ‘weak' but a precise pulse quality: it
      is extremely common.

     Clinical significance
   The Weak pulse indicates Yang deficiency; it is a very common pulse in
chronic conditions, more so than the Empty pulse. However, it may also indicate
Blood deficiency or deficiency of the Original Qi.
   If the pulse is relatively Floating at the middle level and very Weak at the
deep level, this indicates severe deficiency of Blood with collapse of the blood
vessels.
   According to Dr Shen, we can diﬀerentiate the Weak pulse at the superficial,
middle or deep level. A Weak quality at the superficial level indicates Yang
deficiency and it may be due to overwork; if the pulse becomes Weak at the
superficial level in the short term, this indicates lack of sleep. A Weak quality at
the middle level indicates Blood deficiency, whereas a Weak quality at the deep
level indicates Yin deficiency.
   Common conditions presenting with a Weak pulse are Yang deficiency, Blood
deficiency and deficiency of the Original Qi. These pa erns, presenting with a
Weak pulse, are common in many digestive diseases, menstrual disorders,
profuse sweating, nocturnal emissions and haemorrhages.
   Box 50.14 summarizes the clinical significance of a weak pulse.

     Clinical significance in each position (Li Shi Zhen)

     Front position
   This indicates Yang deficiency.

     Middle position
   This indicates Stomach and Spleen deficiency.

     Rear position
   This denotes decline of Yang-Qi, or exhaustion of Yin-Essence.

     Fine
Pulse description
   The Fine pulse is thin and thread-like but it is clear and straight, although
soft. It feels like a fine line under the finger.

     Clinical significance
   The Fine pulse indicates primarily a severe deficiency of Blood but also of Qi.
The ‘Simple Questions' in Chapter 17 says: ‘ The Fine pulse indicates Qi
deficiency.' 7 Compared with the Choppy pulse, the Fine pulse indicates a more
severe deficiency of Blood. It may also indicate Yin deficiency.
   The Fine pulse is obviously of the empty type by definition but it may be
combined with full-type qualities, such as Wiry or Tight. The Fine pulse with
strength indicates Dampness.
   A Fine and Weak pulse in very young people indicates a constitutional
deficiency of Original Qi.
   The Fine pulse is a very common pulse quality, mostly appearing in Blood or
Yin deficiency, or both. Diseases commonly presenting with this pulse include
digestive diseases, diarrhoea and menstrual disorders.
   Box 50.15 summarizes the clinical significance of a Fine pulse.

   This indicates severe Blood or Essence deficiency.

     Fine-Deep
   This indicates retention of Dampness, as often seen in Painful Obstruction
Syndrome.

     Fine-Weak
   This indicates severe Blood deficiency and it is often seen in night sweating.
   According to Dr Shen, a Fine-Weak pulse in a middle-aged person means that
he or she has overworked or overexercised between the ages of 15 and 20.

     Differentiation of similar pulses

     Clinical significance
   The Minute pulse indicates severe deficiency of Blood, Essence or Yin; it may
also indicate deficiency of the Original Qi. It is only seen in chronic conditions
and it indicates a poor prognosis; it is often seen in cancer.
   Common       conditions   which    present   with    a   Minute   pulse   include
haemorrhages, spontaneous sweating, nocturnal emissions, chronic diarrhoea,
menstrual diseases, collapse of Yang and chronic vomiting.

     Soggy (Weak-Floating)
Pulse description
   The Soggy (also called Weak-Floating) pulse can only be felt at the superficial
level; it is relatively floating but weak and soft like wet co on-wool or wet bread.
It disappears when a stronger pressure is applied. In Chinese it is called ru ,
which means ‘sodden', but also ruan , which means ‘soft'.
   In my previous books, I call this pulse quality ‘Weak-Floating', which
describes well its characteristic of being weak, soft but also slightly floating.

     Clinical significance
   The Soggy pulse indicates chronic Qi deficiency with retention of Dampness.
It is a relatively common pulse quality in chronic conditions with Dampness,
such as postviral fatigue syndrome. The Soggy pulse also indicates Stomach-Qi
deficiency.
   Common conditions presenting with a Soggy pulse are digestive disorders,
chronic fatigue syndrome, asthma, nocturnal emissions and diarrhoea.

Pulse description
   The Short pulse does not fill a pulse position. Within each position it can be
felt in the centre but it tapers oﬀ at the head and tail. The Short pulse is more
commonly felt in the Front and Middle positions, especially the former.

    Clinical significance
   The Short pulse indicates severe deficiency of Qi, especially of the Lungs and
Heart.
   Common pa erns which present with a Short pulse are Lung-Qi deficiency,
Heart-Qi deficiency, Stomach-Qi deficiency and deficiency of Qi and Blood.

    Differentiation of similar pulses

    Moving
   The Moving pulse is short, shaped like a bean, rapid and gives the
impression of vibrating rather than pulsating. The Short pulse shares with the
moving pulse only the characteristic of being short, but none of the others.

        Empty
   The Empty pulse is soft and relatively floating and, like the Short pulse,
indicates Qi deficiency. The Short pulse is neither soft nor floating.

        Weak
   The Weak pulse is soft and can be felt only at the middle and deep levels but
is not short. The Short pulse can be felt at all levels.

        Hidden
   The Hidden pulse is very deep and diﬃcult to feel but it occupies its normal
pulse position, whereas the Short pulse does not fill its pulse position.

        Hollow
Pulse description
   The Hollow pulse can be felt at the superficial and deep levels but not at the
middle one; it is, as its name implies, hollow like an onion stalk. This pulse also
feels quite solid on the sides of the fingers when rolling the fingers from side to
side.

        Clinical significance
   The Hollow pulse indicates loss of Blood and it appears after a haemorrhage.
It should be stressed that this indicates a pathological haemorrhage and not, for
example, the normal menstrual bleeding. It may also appear after a profuse loss
of Body Fluids from sweating, vomiting or diarrhoea. If the pulse is Hollow and
Rapid, it may indicate a forthcoming haemorrhage. The Hollow pulse is not
common.
   Box 50.19 summarizes the clinical significance of a Hollow pulse.

        Combinations

        Hollow-Floating
   This indicates injury of Qi and Yin.

    Choppy
   The Choppy pulse is generally empty, rough and without a wave, whereas
the Hollow pulse has a definite shape and a wave but is empty only at the
middle level.

    Empty
   The Empty pulse is relatively superficial and soft and disappears with a
relatively light pressure. The Hollow pulse is neither superficial nor soft; it
disappears with a stronger pressure but it has more shape than the Empty pulse.

    Leather
Pulse description
   The Leather pulse can be felt at a superficial level, stretched like the skin of a
drum and empty at the deep level; it feels hard on the outside but empty inside,
like a drum.

    Clinical significance
   The Leather pulse indicates severe deficiency of Blood, Essence or Yin. It also
indicates Qi floating upwards because it is not rooted by Blood.
   Common pa erns presenting with a Leather pulse include depletion of Blood
or Yin, or both, and these may appear in habitual miscarriage, menorrhagia and
nocturnal emissions. In my experience, the Leather pulse is frequently felt in
advanced cases of multiple sclerosis.
   Box 50.20 summarizes the clinical significance of a Leather pulse.

           BOX 50.20       LEATHER: SUMMARY OF
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
         • Severe deficiency of Blood
         • Severe deficiency of Essence
         • Severe deficiency of Yin
         • Qi floating upwards

    Combinations

    Leather-Rapid
   This indicates severe deficiency of Yin with Empty-Heat.

    Leather-Slow
   This indicates severe Blood deficiency with Blood stasis.

    Leather-Choppy
   This denotes severe Blood deficiency.

    Differentiation of similar pulses

    Choppy
   The Choppy pulse is rough, jagged and lacks a wave but is not felt clearly at
the superficial level. The Leather pulse, which like the Choppy pulse also
indicates Blood deficiency, feels relatively hard at the superficial level; at the
deep level, it is more empty than the Choppy pulse.

    Hollow
   The Hollow pulse is empty in the middle and can be felt clearly at the
superficial and deep levels, whereas the Leather pulse cannot be felt at the deep
level. Another diﬀerence is that the Leather pulse feels relatively hard and
stretched at the superficial level, which the Hollow pulse does not.

    Floating-Empty
   The Floating-Empty pulse and the Hollow pulse share the common
characteristic of being empty at the deep level. However, the Floating-Empty
pulse is relatively soft at the superficial level, or at least much softer than the
Leather pulse, which feels hard and stretched at the superficial level.

    Wiry
   The Leather pulse has a slightly Wiry quality on the surface but it disappears
on pressure, whereas the Wiry pulse is Wiry at all levels and does not disappear
on pressure. The Leather pulse, although hard on the superficial level like the
Wiry pulse, feels more ‘flat' on the superficial level than the Wiry pulse.

    Hidden
Pulse description
   The Hidden pulse is simply an extreme case of a Deep pulse: it is deeper than
the Deep pulse and can be felt only with a very strong pressure at a very deep
level near the bone.

    Clinical significance
   The clinical significance of the Hidden pulse is similar to that of the Deep
pulse: it simply means that the condition is an interior one and its clinical
significance depends on its association with other qualities, especially the Full or
Empty ones.
   However, the Hidden quality always indicates a ‘blockage' in the Interior,
especially when it is of the full type; ‘blockage' in this case means that a
pathogenic factor is lodged deep in the interior of the body. It is ‘locked' inside
and it is diﬃcult to expel. For example, depending on its association with other
qualities, the Hidden pulse could indicate ‘blocked' stagnation of Qi, ‘blocked'
Blood stasis, ‘blocked' Heat in the Interior, ‘blocked' Cold, ‘blocked' chronic
pain, ‘blocked' Phlegm and ‘blocked' retention of food. The most important
distinction to make is whether the Hidden pulse is of the full or empty type.
   When the Hidden pulse is also of the empty type, it indicates severe Yang
deficiency.

         The Hidden pulse often indicates that a pathogenic factor is
      ‘blocked' deep inside the body. Examples of such pathogenic
      factors are Qi stagnation, Blood stasis, Heat, Cold, Phlegm or
      retention of food.
   Common conditions presenting with a Hidden pulse include digestive
diseases, Blood stasis, abdominal masses, heart disease and vomiting.
   According to Dr Shen, the Hidden pulse in apparently healthy people
indicates a lifestyle of overindulging in drugs and sexual activity. He pinpoints
the age to which this lifestyle refers according to the degree of the Hidden pulse:
if the pulse is very Hidden it indicates that that lifestyle occurred between 10 and
15; if slightly less Hidden, between 15 and 20; if even less Hidden, over 20.

         According to Dr Shen, the Hidden pulse in a seemingly
      healthy person may indicate overindulgence in drugs and
      excessive sexual activity in the past.
   Box 50.21 summarizes the clinical significance of a Hidden pulse.

    Combinations

    Hidden-Full
   This indicates Qi and Blood stagnation, retention of food or internal Cold or
internal Heat according to whether the pulse is Slow or Rapid.

    Hidden-Empty
   This indicates severe Yang deficiency with internal Cold.

   The Hidden pulse is very deep and diﬃcult to feel but it occupies its normal
pulse position, whereas the Short pulse does not fill its pulse position.

    Clinical significance in each position (Li Shi Zhen)

    Front position
   This is seen in retention of food in the chest, stagnation of Qi, retching, and
an uncomfortable sensation in the heart region.

    Scattered
Pulse description
   The Sca ered pulse feels as if it were ‘broken' into many tiny dots instead of
flowing smoothly. It is relatively superficial but it disappears easily with
pressure.

    Clinical significance
   The Sca ered pulse indicates a severe and advanced stage of Qi and Blood
deficiency and particularly of Kidney-Qi and of the Original Qi; it is a pulse that
always indicates a serious condition.
   In pregnancy, the Sca ered pulse indicates the likelihood of an imminent
miscarriage, while before delivery it indicates that the labour may be long and
diﬃcult. After childbirth it indicates severe depletion of Blood and the woman
should be treated, even in the absence of symptoms, to prevent collapse of
Blood.
   Common conditions presenting with a Sca ered pulse include heart disease,
digestive disorders, miscarriage, and asthma.

    Differentiation of similar pulses

    Empty
   The Empty pulse and the Sca ered pulse share the characteristic of being
relatively superficial and of disappearing when more pressure is applied. The
Empty pulse has more shape and flows more smoothly than the Sca ered pulse;
although obviously empty, the Empty pulse has much more ‘body' than the
Sca ered pulse. In addition the Sca ered pulse, unlike the Empty pulse, feels as
if it were broken into tiny dots.

     Choppy
   The Choppy pulse and the Sca ered pulse share the characteristic of feeling
‘rough' and not flowing smoothly. However, the Choppy pulse has more shape
than the Sca ered pulse.

     Fine
   The Fine pulse is simply thinner than normal but it can be felt clearly and
flows relatively smoothly, whereas the Sca ered pulse does not flow smoothly
and has no clear shape.

     Minute
   The Minute pulse is extremely thin but can be felt clearly and flows relatively
smoothly, whereas the Sca ered pulse does not flow smoothly and has no clear

     Clinical significance in each position (Li Shi Zhen)

     Front position
   In the left Front it denotes anxiety and palpitations; in the right Front it is
found in sweating.

     Middle position
   In the left Middle it denotes Phlegm-Fluids in the limbs, and in the right
Middle twitching of legs and oedema.

     Rear position
   This denotes decline of Original Qi.

     FULL-TYPE PULSES
Wiry

     Pulse description
   The Wiry pulse feels superficial and hard: it can be felt very clearly at every
level. At the superficial level it ‘hits' the finger with its force. It is often compared
with the taut string of a musical instrument and if we try to push it down, it
‘springs' back up. This is a common pulse in clinical practice and one that is
relatively easy to distinguish; because it is superficial, hard and springy, it
manifests itself easily without the practitioner having to concentrate on
interpreting it.

     Clinical significance
   The Wiry pulse is extremely common. The chief clinical significance of the
Wiry pulse is that it indicates any of the Full type of Liver disharmonies (e.g.
Liver-Qi stagnation, Liver-Blood stasis, Liver-Yang rising, Liver-Fire, Liver-
Wind).
   A Wiry pulse may also indicate the presence of chronic Phlegm and it is
usually seen in old people. Finally the Wiry pulse may also indicate chronic pain,
even if that pain does not derive from a Liver disharmony; for example, if a
patient has been suﬀering from chronic sciatica on the Bladder channel, the left
Rear pulse position may become Wiry.

          The Wiry pulse does not denote Liver disharmonies only: it
      may also indicate long-standing retention of Phlegm.
   The Wiry pulse is of the full type by definition but it may be seen in Empty
conditions as well combining with empty-type pulse qualities; for example, a
relatively common clinical finding is that of a pulse that is Fine in general but
also Wiry on the left in a patient suﬀering from Blood deficiency and Liver-Yang
rising. A Wiry but relatively Weak pulse, or a pulse that is Wiry on the left and
Weak on the right, indicates Stomach and Spleen deficiency with stagnation of
Cold or rebellious Liver-Qi invading the Stomach; such pa erns manifest with
sour regurgitation, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, hiccup and belching.
   It is normal for the pulse to be relatively Wiry in spring. The ‘Simple
Questions' in Chapter 19 says: ‘ Spring is the season of the Liver, it pertains to
East and Wood. Everything grows during this season; when the Qi of the Spring
arrives the pulse should be relatively soft, weak, light, slippery and long, all of
which explain why it is called Wiry. The opposite of this indicates disease.' 8
   Common conditions that present with a Wiry pulse are menstrual pain,
premenstrual tension, depression, anxiety, chronic Phlegm, chronic pain and
mental illness.
   Box 50.23 summarizes the clinical significance of a Wiry pulse.

    Differentiation of similar pulses

    Tight
   The Tight pulse and the Wiry pulse share the common characteristic of
feeling hard under pressure and being ‘springy'. The two main diﬀerences are
that the Tight pulse is thicker than the Wiry pulse and feels like a rope rather
than the string of a musical instrument, and that the Wiry pulse is more
superficial than the Tight pulse and it hits the finger more forcefully.

    Firm
   The Firm pulse can be felt only at the middle and deep levels and feels hard.
The Wiry pulse also feels hard but it is more springy and can be felt clearly at the
superficial level as well. In other words, the Firm pulse is a pulse that is Wiry but
only at the middle and deep levels.
    Leather
   The Leather pulse has a slightly Wiry quality on the surface but it disappears
on pressure, whereas the Wiry pulse is Wiry at all levels and does not disappear
on pressure. The Leather pulse, although hard on the superficial level like the
Wiry pulse, feels more ‘flat' on the superficial level than the Wiry pulse.

    Clinical significance in each position (Li Shi Zhen)

    Front position
   This occurs in headaches, Phlegm in chest and diaphragm.

    Middle position
   In the left Middle it is seen in alternation of chills and fever, and abdominal
masses; in the right Middle it denotes Cold in Stomach and Spleen, and chest
and abdominal pain.

    Rear position
   This denotes hernia pain and stiﬀness of the legs.

    Tight
Pulse description
   The Tight pulse is hard and feels like a rope being twisted; it is strong and
has a springy feeling when the pressure is released, although not as springy as
the Wiry pulse.

    Clinical significance
   In general the Tight pulse indicates Cold and can be found in many diﬀerent
conditions.
   In external invasions of Wind, the Floating-Tight pulse indicates the invasion
of Wind-Cold with the prevalence of Cold (Greater-Yang pa ern — prevalence
of Cold within the identification of pa erns according to the Six Stages).
   In internal conditions a Tight pulse indicates Cold and usually Full-Cold,
although it can be combined with an empty type of pulse quality in conditions of
Empty-Cold.
   Like the Wiry pulse it may indicate chronic pain, usually from Cold. The
Tight pulse is also frequently seen in asthma when this condition is associated
with Cold in the Lungs.
   The Tight pulse is also frequently seen in digestive disorders characterized by
the presence of Cold or retention of food in the Stomach and Spleen, or both,
with nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
   The Tight pulse is frequently combined with a Slippery pulse in the presence
of Cold-Phlegm.
   The Tight pulse may also indicate Cold in the Blood.
   Common conditions presenting with a Tight pulse include chronic pain,
digestive disorders, invasion of Cold, menstrual pain, diarrhoea from Cold,
asthma and arteriosclerosis.

   There is a diﬀerence between left and right Front positions (Li Shi Zhen does
not expand on this).

     Middle position
   This is seen in severe chest and abdominal pain.

     Rear position
   This denotes syndrome from excess Cold, Running Piglet syndrome, or
hernia pain.

     Overflowing
Pulse description
   The Overflowing pulse feels large under the finger, very superficial and
broad; as its name implies, it is often described as feeling like a river flooding its
banks because the pulse goes beyond its natural boundary in all directions.

     Clinical significance
   The Overflowing pulse indicates Heat and it is nearly always rapid as well.
Although the Overflowing pulse is full by definition, to interpret its clinical
significance we need to distinguish an Overflowing pulse with strength from one
without strength.
   Although, according to the theory, an Overflowing pulse indicates Heat by
definition, there are situations where it may be due to other causes, especially
when it is found in only one position, and some of these are described below. For
example, an Overflowing quality on the Heart pulse may indicate emotional
problems, not necessarily manifesting with Heat. Therefore, when we feel an
Overflowing pulse, it is important to check this against the tongue and the inside
of the lower eyelids: in true conditions of Heat, the tongue will be Red and the
inside of the lower eyelids will also be red.

     Overflowing with strength
   The Overflowing pulse with strength always indicates Full-Heat, which may
aﬀect the Liver, Heart, Lungs or Stomach; in this case it is also rapid.
   In the course of an acute febrile disease, the Overflowing pulse with strength
is seen with Heat in the Stomach at the Qi level. In this case the Overflowing
quality indicates that the Heat is Overflowing from the main channels into the
Connecting channels; in such a case, if the pulse is very Overflowing and very
rapid this indicates that the Heat is close to progressing to the Nutritive-Qi or
Blood level and the possible development of macules. Thus, in the course of an
acute febrile disease, an Overflowing quality often indicates that the condition is
changing and progressing to the next level.
   The Overflowing pulse quality is frequently felt in individual positions only
and in such cases it usually indicates Heat in that particular organ. However, its
clinical significance in such cases may be slightly diﬀerent, often indicating
severe emotional problems. For example, if the pulse is Overflowing only on the
Heart position, this definitely indicates that the patient is suﬀering from severe
emotional problems aﬀecting the Heart. If the pulse is Overflowing only on the
Liver position, it indicates that the person is suﬀering from repressed anger,
resentment or frustration. If it is Overflowing on the Lung position it indicates
that the patient is suﬀering from long-term unexpressed sadness and grief.
   It is important to stress that, when the pulse is Overflowing only in one
position, it may be ‘Overflowing' only in relation to the other positions. For
example, the pulse may be Weak in general and quite diﬃcult to feel but the
pulse of the Heart position stands out as being more superficial and larger than
the others: we would therefore interpret this Heart pulse as being ‘Overflowing'
but it would not be as Overflowing as the classic Overflowing pulse.

           The Overflowing pulse on individual positions indicates either
        Heat in that particular organ (tongue Red and pulse Rapid) or
        severe emotional problems related to that particular organ (Heart,
        Liver, Lungs).

     Overflowing without strength
   The Overflowing pulse without strength feels large, superficial and flooding
but it disappears when more pressure is applied and it has no strength at the
deep level. Its strength indicates Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat and exhaustion
of Body Fluids. In this respect, its clinical significance is the same as the Floating-
Empty pulse but it indicates a more severe stage of it and more intense Empty-
Heat.
   The pulse may also be Overflowing without strength and Floating, which
indicates a condition of severe Yin deficiency, intense Empty-Heat and Qi rising
to the top.
   According to Dr Shen, an Overflowing-Hollow pulse is frequently seen in
hypertension and diabetes; in the former condition, the pulse is Overflowing and
Hollow more in the Front and Middle positions, whereas in the la er more so in
the Middle and Rear positions.
   Common conditions that present with an Overflowing pulse include mental
illness, febrile diseases and severe emotional problems.
   Box 50.25 summarizes the clinical significance of an Overflowing pulse.

           BOX 50.25        OVERFLOWING PULSE:
        SUMMARY OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
           • Full-Heat (Overflowing with strength)
           • Stomach-Heat pa ern at Qi Level
           • Heat in a particular organ
           • Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat and exhaustion of Body
        Fluids (Overflowing without strength)

    Combinations

    Overflowing-Floating
   This indicates invasion of Wind-Heat with intense Heat; this condition would
progress very rapidly to the Qi level.

    Overflowing-Floating without strength
   This denotes severe Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat.

    Overflowing-Deep
   This indicates internal Heat.

    Overflowing-Slippery
   This indicates Phlegm-Heat with prevalence of Heat.

    Overflowing-Soft
   This indicates Yin deficiency with exhaustion of Body Fluids and Empty-
Heat.

    Overflowing-Tight
   This indicates Chest Painful Obstruction Syndrome or blood in the stools
with constipation.

    Overflowing-Hollow-Rapid with strength
   This indicates imminent bleeding.

    Overflowing-Hollow-Weak
   This indicates a previous haemorrhage.

    Differentiation of similar pulses
        Big
   The Big pulse is very similar to the Overflowing pulse in so far as they are
both superficial, large and beyond the pulse boundary. The Big pulse, however,
is ‘rounder' than the Overflowing pulse, has more shape and is not necessarily
rapid.

        Full
   The Full pulse simply indicates that the pulse is full and relatively hard,
whereas the Overflowing pulse is larger than its boundary, more superficial and
relatively softer.

        Long
   The Long pulse extends beyond the pulse positions lengthwise and is not
superficial. The Overflowing pulse extends beyond the pulse positions in all
directions and is superficial.

        Clinical significance in each position (Li Shi Zhen)

        Front position
   In the left Front this denotes Heart-Fire blazing upwards; in the right Front it
is found in a feeling of heaviness in the chest.

        Middle position
   This indicates Liver-Yang rising, or Stomach and Spleen deficiency.

        Rear position
   This denotes exhaustion of Kidney-Essence, or deficiency of Yin with blazing
Fire.

        Big
Pulse description
   The Big pulse is large, broad, Overflowing from its boundary and full. It is
very similar to the Overflowing pulse but it has more shape and is not
necessarily rapid.

        Clinical significance
   The Big pulse generally indicates Heat and its clinical significance is similar
to that of the Overflowing pulse. When we feel a Big pulse, it is important to
check this against the tongue and the inside of the lower eyelids: in true
conditions of Heat, the tongue will be Red and the inside of the lower eyelids
will also be red. We need to diﬀerentiate the Big pulse with strength from the Big
pulse without strength.
     Big with strength
   The Big pulse with strength indicates internal Heat which may occur in the
Heart, Liver, Lungs or Stomach. In acute febrile diseases, it indicates Heat in the
Stomach at the Qi level.
   Common pa erns presenting with a Big pulse with strength are acute febrile
diseases at the Qi level, Liver- Fire, Heart-Fire, Heat in the Intestines and
Phlegm-Fire and these appear in conditions such as acute chest infections,
intestinal infections or heart disease.

     Big without strength
   The Big pulse without strength indicates Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat or
severe depletion of Blood. The ‘Simple Questions' in Chapter 17 says: ‘ The Big
pulse indicates deficiency of Yin and excess of Yang with Empty-Heat.' 9
   Common pa erns presenting with a Big pulse without strength are severe
Blood deficiency, Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat and Blood deficiency with
Liver-Yang rising. This pulse frequently appears in menstrual disorders and
diabetes.

both superficial, large and going beyond the pulse boundary. The Big pulse,
however, is ‘rounder' than the Overflowing pulse, has more shape and is not
necessarily rapid.

     Full
   The Full pulse simply indicates that the pulse is full and relatively hard,
whereas the Big pulse is larger than its boundary, more superficial and relatively
softer.

     Long
   The Long pulse extends beyond the pulse positions lengthwise and is not
superficial. The Big pulse extends beyond the pulse positions in all directions
and is superficial.

     Clinical significance in each position
   This is the same as for the Overflowing pulse.

     Firm
Pulse description
   The Firm pulse is felt only at the deep level; it feels hard and it combines the
qualities of Full, Wiry and Long. It is basically a pulse that is Wiry only at the
middle and deep levels (the Wiry pulse can be felt clearly at all levels).

     Clinical significance
   The Firm pulse generally indicates internal Cold often causing chronic pain.
It may also indicate accumulation in the Interior, stagnation of Qi or stasis of
Blood. It is a pulse quality that is associated with abdominal masses or
abdominal pain and it may also indicate Blood stasis deriving from Cold.
   A pulse that is Firm on all three positions of the right or on both Middle
positions of left and right indicates a pathology of the Penetrating Vessel.
   The Firm pulse quality is relatively common.
   Common conditions presenting with a Firm pulse include Chest Painful
Obstruction Syndrome, convulsions, abdominal masses, abdominal pain,
menstrual diseases, and arteriosclerosis.
   Box 50.27 summarizes the clinical significance of a Firm pulse.

            BOX 50.27         FIRM PULSE: SUMMARY OF
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
            • Internal Cold
            • Accumulation in the Interior
            • Stagnation of Qi
            • Blood stasis
            • Stagnation in the Penetrating Vessel

     Combinations

     Firm-Tight
   This indicates internal Cold possibly with oedema.

     Firm-Slow
   This indicates internal Cold and Blood stasis.

     Firm-Choppy
   This denotes Blood stasis.

     Differentiation of similar pulses

     Wiry
   The Wiry pulse and the Firm pulse share similar characteristics of being hard,
full and long. The main diﬀerence is that the Wiry pulse is felt clearly at all
levels, whereas the Firm pulse is felt only at the middle and deep levels.

     Tight
   The Tight pulse and the Firm pulse share similar characteristics of being hard
and full. The main diﬀerence is that the Tight pulse is felt clearly at all levels,
whereas the Firm pulse is felt only at the middle and deep levels.

     Full
   The Full pulse can be felt at all levels, whereas the Firm pulse can be felt only
at the deep level.

     Hidden
   The Hidden pulse is sunken beneath the muscles near the bone and is very
diﬃcult to feel, whereas the Firm pulse can be felt clearly at the middle and deep
levels.

   Not given by Li Shi Zhen.

     Long
Pulse description
   The Long pulse is simply longer than normal, that is, it extends lengthwise
beyond the pulse boundary. In order to judge whether a pulse is Long, normal
or Short, it is important to roll the finger back and forth (distally and proximally)
on each position.

     Clinical significance
   The Long pulse usually indicates Heat. It may also indicate a Liver
disharmony of the Full type with rebellious Qi (e.g. Liver-Yang rising or
rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel).
   The Long pulse may also indicate Phlegm. The ‘Simple Questions' in Chapter
18 says: ‘ If the Liver pulse is relatively soft and feels like the tip of a long
bamboo pole, it indicates a harmonious state of the Liver … If the Liver pulse is
Full and Slippery and feels like moving along a long bamboo pole, it indicates
Liver disease.' 10
   If the pulse is Long, relatively soft, Slowed-down, neither Floating nor Deep,
neither Rapid nor Slow, neither Full nor Empty, it is a sign of health.
   Common conditions that present with a Long pulse are Liver disease,
hypochondrial pain, mental illness, rebellious Qi in the Penetrating vessel and
haemoptysis.
   According to Dr Shen, if the pulse is Long on one side and Short on the other,
it indicates a serious problem. Usually the side displaying the Long quality is
also Wiry, Fine and Rapid. For example, if the left-side pulse is Long-Wiry-Fine-
Rapid and the right-side Short, this indicates that the person is extremely
nervous and suﬀers from a Liver and Heart disharmony. If the right-side pulse is
Long, Weak on the Lung position, Fine-Tight on the Middle and Rear positions
and Short on the left side, it indicates a Stomach disharmony and general
deficiency of Qi.
   Box 50.28 summarizes the clinical significance of a Long pulse.

           BOX 50.28        LONG PULSE: SUMMARY OF

     Long-Slow
   This indicates stagnation of Qi.
    Long-Floating
   This indicates invasion of external Wind-Heat.

    Long-Deep
   This indicates internal Heat.

   This may indicate hypertension or diabetes, according to Dr Shen.

    Differentiation of similar pulses

    Overflowing
   The Long pulse extends beyond the pulse positions lengthwise and is not
superficial. The Overflowing pulse extends beyond the pulse positions in all
directions and is superficial.

    Moving
Pulse description
   The Moving pulse is short, Slippery, rapid and it gives the impression of
‘shaking' or ‘vibrating' instead of pulsating. It is shaped like a bean without head
or tail. The Moving pulse is felt more frequently on the Front and Middle
positions.

    Clinical significance
   The Moving pulse generally reflects severe emotional problems and
particularly shock, fright or severe anxiety. In cases of shock, the pulse can
remain Moving for years afterwards.
   The Moving pulse may also indicate severe deficiency of Qi and Blood, often
manifesting with cramps in the legs. The Moving pulse with strength may also
indicate Qi stagnation.
   Box 50.29 summarizes the clinical significance of a Moving pulse.

            BOX 50.29      MOVING PULSE: SUMMARY
      OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
         • Shock

     PULSES WITH IRREGULARITIES OF RATE
OR RHYTHM
Knotted

     Pulse description
   The Kno ed pulse quality refers to the rhythm of the pulse: it denotes a pulse
that is Slow and that stops at irregular intervals.

     Clinical significance
   The Kno ed pulse indicates internal Cold with stagnation of Qi and Blood
and it always indicates a Heart disharmony (although, of course, the rate and
rhythm of the pulse are the same in all positions). It is frequently seen in heart
disease, such as coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, rheumatic heart disease,
etc. A Kno ed pulse can also come on after surgery. In young people, a Kno ed
pulse may indicate a constitutional deficiency of the Original Qi or a severe
deficiency of Yang due to excessive physical work or excessive sexual activity
during puberty.
   We need to diﬀerentiate between the Kno ed pulse with strength and the
Kno ed pulse without strength.

     Knotted with strength
   The Kno ed pulse with strength may indicate several conditions as follows:

          • severe Qi stagnation from Cold
          • chronic Phlegm stagnating in the Interior in old people
          • retention of food
          • severe Qi stagnation from emotional problems
          • Blood stasis
          • abdominal masses.

     Knotted without strength
   The Kno ed pulse without strength may indicate a constitutional deficiency
of the Original Qi, a deficiency of Kidney-Essence, possibly from excessive
sexual activity, or a severe deficiency of Yang.
   Common conditions presenting with a Kno ed pulse include heart disease,
coronary heart disease, angina pectoris and rheumatic heart disease.
   Box 50.30 summarizes the clinical significance of a Kno ed pulse.

          BOX 50.30         KNOTTED PULSE: SUMMARY
      OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE

             • Chronic Phlegm stagnating in the Interior (old people)
             • Retention of food
             • Severe Qi stagnation from emotional problems
             • Blood stasis
             • deficiency of Original Qi (without strength)
             • deficiency of Kidney-Essence (without strength)
             • Severe deficiency of Yang
             • Heart disease

     Combinations

     Knotted-Choppy
   This indicates Blood stasis and may point to coronary heart disease.

     Knotted-Slippery
   This indicates chronic retention of Phlegm and may point to rheumatic heart
disease.

     Knotted-Floating
   This indicates invasion of Cold in the Channels.

     Knotted-Deep
   This indicates accumulation in the Interior.

     Knotted-Wiry
   This indicates a disease of the arteries or hypertension.

     Differentiation of similar pulses

     Intermittent
   The Intermi ent pulse stops at regular intervals and may be rapid, slow or of
normal rate, whereas the Kno ed pulse is always slow and stops at irregular
intervals.

     Slow
   The Slow pulse and the Kno ed pulse are both slow but the Kno ed pulse
stops at irregular intervals.

     Clinical significance in each position
   This is not applicable as an abnormality in the speed or rate of the pulse will
be the same in all positions.

     Hasty
Pulse description
   The Hasty pulse quality refers to the rhythm of the pulse: it denotes a pulse
that is Rapid and stops at irregular intervals.

     Clinical significance
   The Hasty pulse indicates internal Heat and it is always related to a Heart
disharmony (although, of course, the rate and rhythm of the pulse are the same
in all positions). The Hasty pulse may also indicate retention of food or Phlegm
occurring against a background of internal Heat, or stagnation of Qi or Blood.
   The Hasty pulse without strength indicates severe depletion of the Original
Qi and a separation of Yin and Yang; this always indicates a serious condition,
more so than the Kno ed pulse without strength.
   The Hasty pulse may also indicate rebellious Qi from anger.
   Common conditions which present with a Hasty pulse are mental illness,
chronic bronchitis with Phlegm-Heat and heart disease.
   Box 50.31 summarizes the clinical significance of a Hasty pulse.

          BOX 50.31         HASTY PULSE: SUMMARY OF

          • Severe depletion of Original Qi (without strength)
          • Separation of Yin and Yang
          • Rebellious Qi from anger

     Combinations

     Hasty-Overflowing
   This indicates Heat in the Stomach.

     Hasty-Slippery
   This indicates long-standing retention of Phlegm-Heat.

     Hasty-Wiry
   This indicates Liver-Fire and Heart-Fire.

     Hasty-Slippery-Wiry
   This indicates Heart-Fire, Liver-Fire and Phlegm-Heat.

     Hasty-Floating
   This indicates Heat in the Bright Yang.
     Hasty-Fine without strength
   This indicates collapse of Heart-Qi.

     Differentiation of similar pulses

     Intermittent
   The Intermi ent pulse stops at regular intervals and may be rapid, slow or of
normal rate, whereas the Hasty pulse is always rapid and stops at irregular
intervals.

     Rapid
   The Rapid pulse and the Hasty pulse are both rapid but, whereas the Rapid
pulse is regular, the Hasty pulse stops at irregular intervals.

     Clinical significance in each position
   This is not applicable as an abnormality in the speed or rate of the pulse will
be the same in all positions.

     Hurried
Pulse description
   The Hurried pulse is rapid by definition, beating at least eight times for each
breath cycle, and it gives the impression of being hurried, anxious, agitated and
urgent.

     Clinical significance
   The Hurried pulse generally indicates severe deficiency of Yin with intense
Empty-Heat; it always indicates a serious condition.
   The Chinese name for this pulse quality, Ji , is the same as in Li Ji , that is, the
symptomatology of rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel. Literally, Ji means
‘urgency' and in the context of this pathology, Li Ji indicates a feeling of energy
rising from the abdomen to the throat, accompanied by a feeling of restlessness
and anxiety. In severe cases of this pathology, the pulse could be Hurried.
   Box 50.32 summarizes the clinical significance of a Hurried pulse.

             BOX 50.32        HURRIED PULSE: SUMMARY
      OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE

             • Severe rebellious Qi of the Penetrating Vessel

     Combinations

     Hurried-Floating
   This indicates severe Empty-Heat arising from Yin deficiency.

     Hurried-Deep
   This indicates a condition of rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel.

     Hurried-Floating-Empty
   This denotes severe Yin deficiency.

     Hurried-Slippery
   This indicates Empty-Heat from Yin deficiency with Phlegm.

     Hurried-Overflowing
   This indicates severe Empty-Heat arising from Yin deficiency.

     Differentiation of similar pulses

     Hasty
   The Hasty pulse is Rapid and stops at irregular intervals. The Hurried pulse
is more rapid than the Rapid pulse and it gives the impression of being agitated
and urgent.

     Rapid
   The Hurried pulse is a form of the Rapid pulse. It diﬀers from it in so far as it
is more rapid and it conveys the impression of being extremely agitated, urgent
and hurried.

     Clinical significance in each position
   This is not applicable as an abnormality in the speed or rate of the pulse will
be the same in all positions.

     Intermittent
Pulse description
   The Intermi ent pulse stops at regular intervals: it may be slow, rapid or of
normal rate. After stopping, it gives the impression of taking a long time to start
again. In order to establish whether or not a pulse is Intermi ent, it is important
to count the beats for a long time because it may stop only once in every 50 beats.

     Clinical significance
   The Intermi ent pulse indicates always a Heart disharmony but also the
severe depletion of other Yin organs. The ‘Simple Questions' in Chapter 17 says:
‘ The Intermi ent pulse indicates depletion of Qi.' 11 The Intermi ent pulse is
seen most frequently in severe deficiency of Heart-Qi and Spleen-Qi.
   The shorter the interval at which it stops, the greater the number of Yin
organs are diseased. According to Chapter 5 of the ‘Spiritual Axis', if the pulse
halts every 50 beats, one Yin organ is diseased; if it halts every 40 beats, two Yin
organs are diseased; if it halts every 30 beats, three Yin organs are diseased; if it
halts every 20 beats, four Yin organs are diseased; and if it halts every 10 beats,
all the Yin organs are diseased. 12 If the pulse stops regularly after less than 4
beats, this indicates a serious condition.
   The Intermi ent pulse may also indicate shock. Strangely, old Chinese books
say that an Intermi ent pulse at around a hundred days of pregnancy is normal.
   Common conditions which present with an Intermi ent pulse include heart
disease, Chest Painful Obstruction Syndrome and some menstrual disorders.
   Box 50.33 summarizes the clinical significance of an Intermi ent pulse.

          BOX 50.33         INTERMITTENT PULSE:

   This indicates exhaustion of the Original Qi.

     Intermittent-Rapid
   This indicates internal Heat occurring against a background of a Heart
disharmony.

     Intermittent-Overflowing
   This indicates the location of the disease in the Connecting channels.

     Slowed-Down
Pulse description
   The Slowed-Down pulse has four beats per breath cycle: it is therefore neither
rapid nor slow.

     Clinical significance
   If the patient has no symptoms and the pulse is neither Floating nor Deep
and neither Full nor Empty, the Slowed-Down pulse indicates health. In fact, the
Slowed-Down quality indicates the presence of Stomach-Qi, which is one of the
three a ributes of the normal pulse, as described above.
   In pathological conditions, when combined with other pulse qualities, it
usually indicates Dampness occurring against a background of Stomach and
Spleen deficiency.
   Common conditions which present with a Slowed-Down pulse include stroke
with Phlegm, Wind Painful Obstruction Syndrome, vomiting and hiatus hernia.
   Box 50.34 summarizes the clinical significance of a Slowed-Down pulse.

             BOX 50.34        SLOWED-DOWN PULSE:

be the same in all positions.

  THREE NON-TRADITIONAL PULSE
QUALITIES
Irregular

     Pulse description
   The Irregular pulse stops at irregular intervals but it is neither Slow nor
Rapid. The traditional pulse qualities of Kno ed and Hasty also describe an
irregular pulse but only when it is Slow or Rapid respectively. In order to decide
whether the pulse is Irregular, it is necessary to feel it for a long time because the
pulse may stop only after many beats. Furthermore, it would be advisable not to
diagnose an Irregular pulse during the first consultation because the pulse may
become Irregular only for a definite time; this happens when the patient has had
a shock or has suﬀered emotional stress.

     Clinical significance
   An Irregular pulse always indicates a Heart disharmony, which may be
deficiency such as Heart-Qi or Heart-Blood deficiency or Excess such as Heart-
Blood stasis. As mentioned above, a pulse may be Irregular only for a certain
time when the patient has suﬀered a shock or a deep emotional upset.
Conversely, a person with an Irregular pulse is easily frightened and is prone to
suﬀer from shock.
   A person with an Irregular pulse should not work overlong hours, should not
lift heavy things and should abstain from excessive sexual activity (especially if
male).
   Box 50.35 summarizes the clinical significance of an Irregular pulse.

             BOX 50.35        IRREGULAR PULSE:
         SUMMARY OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE

            • Heart-Blood deficiency
            • Heart-Blood stasis
            • Shock

            A person with an Irregular pulse should not work too long
         hours, should not do heavy lifting and should abstain from
         excessive sexual activity.

    Combinations

    Irregular-Floating
   This indicates severe Heart-Qi deficiency from overwork.

    Irregular-Deep
   This denotes Heart-Blood stasis.

    Irregular-Full
   This also denotes Heart-Blood stasis.

    Irregular-Empty
   This indicates severe Heart-Qi deficiency.

    Irregular-Choppy
   This indicates severe Heart-Blood deficiency.

    Irregular-Slippery
   This indicates Heart-Qi deficiency with Phlegm.

    Differentiation of similar pulses
        Intermittent
   The Intermi ent pulse stops at regular intervals, whereas the Irregular pulse
stops at irregular intervals.

        Knotted
   The Kno ed pulse is a form of Irregular pulse in so far as it stops at irregular
intervals but it is Slow. Unlike the Kno ed pulse, the Irregular pulse has a
normal rate.

        Hasty
   The Hasty pulse is a form of Irregular pulse in so far as it stops at irregular
intervals but it is Rapid. Unlike the Hasty pulse, the Irregular pulse has a normal
rate.

        Clinical significance in each position
   This is not applicable as an abnormality in the speed or rate of the pulse will
be the same in all positions.

        Stagnant
Pulse description
   The Stagnant pulse feels reluctant to come, as if being suppressed, and seems
unlikely to last; it does not flow smoothly and does not have a ‘wave'.

        Clinical significance
   The Stagnant pulse nearly always indicates deep emotional problems, pent-
up feelings, resentment and depression. It also appears when the patient is on
certain drugs and especially tranquillizers.
   Box 50.36 summarizes the clinical significance of a Stagnant pulse.

             BOX 50.36          STAGNANT PULSE: SUMMARY
         OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
            • Deep emotional problems
            • Pent-up feelings
            • Resentment
            • Drugs especially tranquillizers

        Combinations

        Stagnant-Weak
   This indicates severe emotional problems occurring against a background of
Qi and Blood deficiency.
     Stagnant-Choppy
   This indicates severe emotional problems occurring against a background of
Heart-Blood deficiency; the patient is usually very depressed.

     Stagnant-Full
   This indicates pent-up emotions, bo led-up resentment and depression
occurring against a background of Liver-Qi stagnation.

     Differentiation of similar pulses

     Choppy
   The Choppy pulse lacks a ‘wave' and is weak and empty by definition. The
Stagnant pulse also lacks a ‘wave' but in addition it feels reluctant to come and
suppressed.

     Sad
   The Sad pulse, like the Stagnant pulse, lacks a ‘wave' but it is also Short,
which the Stagnant pulse is not.

     Clinical significance in each position

     Front position
   This denotes Heart- and/or Lung-Qi stagnation from sadness, grief or
depression.

     Middle position
   This denotes Liver-Qi stagnation from pent-up anger or resentment, or
tranquillizers.

     Rear position
   This denotes Qi stagnation in the Intestines.

     Sad
Pulse description
   The Sad pulse does not flow smoothly and lacks a wave and is also Short and
rather weak. It is found either in all positions or, if in individual positions, only
in the Front or Middle positions; in other words, the pulse can never have a Sad
quality only on the Rear position. (See Fig. 50.1 on p. 477 .)

     Clinical significance
   The Sad pulse always indicates emotional problems, especially from sadness
and grief; it is a pulse that is frequently seen in bereaved patients. One can gauge
roughly the duration of the emotional problem according to how many positions
are aﬀected. If the pulse is Sad only on the Front position, the problem is recent
(about 6 months in duration); if it is Sad on the Front and Middle positions the
problem is of about a year' duration; if it is Sad all over, this indicates the patient
has been sad for a very long time, possibly the whole life.
   If the person suﬀering from the above emotional problems has a good
constitution, the pulse will display only the Sad quality and no others; if the
person has a weak constitution, emotional problems will eventually aﬀect one or
more organs and this will be reflected in the relevant pulse positions (e.g. Weak
Lung pulse, Weak Stomach pulse, Wiry Liver pulse, etc.).
   Box 50.37 summarizes the clinical significance of a Sad pulse.

          BOX 50.37          SAD PULSE: SUMMARY OF

   This denotes Heart-Blood deficiency deriving from sadness.

     Differentiation of similar pulses

     Choppy
   The Choppy pulse, like the Sad pulse, lacks a ‘wave' but it is also weak and
empty by definition. The Sad pulse is not necessarily weak or empty and it is
also Short.

     Clinical significance in each position
     Front position
   This denotes Heart- or Lung-Qi deficiency, or both, from recent sadness
(about 2 years' duration).

     Middle position
   This denotes Liver- and Heart-Blood deficiency from long-term sadness. The
pulse cannot have the Sad quality in the Middle position only so that, in this
case, it will have this quality in the Middle and Front positions.

     Rear position
   A pulse does not usually have a Sad quality in the Rear position.

     CLASSIFICATION OF PULSE QUALITIES
   Pulse qualities can be classified in various ways, each of which helps to shed
more light on their nature.

     The Eight Basic Groups Of Pulse Qualities

     Floating pulses
   Floating — Hollow — Leather — Soggy — Overflowing

     Deep pulses
   Deep — Hidden — Firm

     Slow pulses
   Slow — Kno ed

     Rapid pulses
   Rapid — Hasty — Hurried — Overflowing — Moving

     Slippery pulses
   Slippery — Soggy — Moving

     Choppy pulses
   Choppy — Sca ered

     Empty pulses
   Empty — Weak — Soggy — Fine — Minute — Sca ered — Short — Choppy

     Full pulses
   Full — Wiry — Tight — Big — Overflowing — Long
   Of course, the same pulse quality may appear in more than one category
according to diﬀerent aspects, for example Overflowing appears in the Floating
and the Full categories.

    The Different Aspects For The Classification Of
Pulse Qualities
   It may help us to understand the nature of pulse qualities if we realize that
they reflect diﬀerent aspects of the pulse; for example, Slow and Rapid clearly
refer to an irregularity of the rate of the pulse, whereas Kno ed, Hasty and
Intermi ent refer to an irregularity of the rhythm.

    According to depth
   Floating — Deep — Hidden — Firm — Leather

    According to rate
   Slow — Rapid — Slowed-down — Hurried — Moving

    According to strength
   Empty — Full — Weak — Sca ered

    According to size
   Big — Overflowing — Fine — Minute

    According to length
   Long — Short — Moving

    According to shape
   Slippery — Choppy — Wiry — Tight — Moving — Hollow — Firm

    According to rhythm
   Kno ed — Hasty — Intermi ent
   Of course, some pulse qualities escape such Classification because they are
defined according to more than one aspect. The following pulse qualities are
good examples:

         • The Soggy pulse is defined according to depth (it is floating),
      size (it is thin) and strength (it is soft).
         • The Leather pulse is defined according to strength (it is
      empty at the deep level) and depth (it is relatively superficial).
         • The Firm pulse is defined according to depth (it is deep),
      strength (it is full) and shape (it is wiry).
          • The Sca ered pulse is defined according to strength (it is
     weak), depth (it is relatively floating) and shape (it is ‘broken up').

    Classification Of Pulse Qualities According To Qi,
Blood And Body Fluids Patterns
   Having discussed the pulse qualities and their clinical significance one by
one, it may be helpful to summarize them by grouping them according to the
main pa erns.

    Qi deficiency
   Empty — Short — Sca ered

    Yang deficiency
   Deep — Weak — Hidden

    Blood deficiency
   Choppy — Fine — Sca ered

    Yin deficiency
   Fine — Minute — Leather

    Qi stagnation
   Wiry

    Blood stasis
   Wiry — Choppy — Slippery — Firm

    Phlegm
   Slippery — Wiry

    Dampness
   Soggy — Slippery

     THE PULSE POSITIONS IN DETAIL
   I shall now discuss the various pulse qualities appearing at each pulse
position and their clinical significance. This information is derived primarily
from Dr J. H. F. Shen and secondarily from my own experience. As indicated
above, Dr Shen places the Large Intestine on the left and the Small Intestine on
the right Rear position: most other authors reverse this.

     Left Front Position (Heart)
   The structure of the left Front position is illustrated in Figure 50.2 .
                                              M1tral              Tiricuspidl

      FIG. 50.2   Structure of left Front pulse position
   The left Front position corresponds to the Heart and Pericardium, or to the
Heart and Small Intestine in the Five-Element arrangement of the pulses.
   Emotional stress frequently causes abnormal qualities at this position and I
shall discuss the most frequent qualities one by one. This discussion assumes
that a particular pulse position has a quality that is diﬀerent from the rest of the
pulse. For example, the discussion of the Overflowing quality on the left Front
position applies if such quality is found only at this position; if all the pulse
positions were Overflowing, the interpretation would of course be diﬀerent.
Overflowing
   I very frequently encounter an Overflowing quality at this position when the
person is aﬀected by deep emotional problems causing anxiety and worry; more
often than not, these problems are due to relationship Diﬃculties. It is important
to stress that the pulse quality may be ‘Overflowing' at this position only in
relation to the rest of the pulse and, when it is so, it ‘stands out' and a racts our
a ention; thus, if all the other pulse positions are quite weak and the pulse on
the Heart position is much stronger and more superficial, we may classify this as
being ‘Overflowing' although the same quality in a person with strong pulses
would be normal. It is essential that a relatively Overflowing quality on this
position when the rest of the positions are very weak is not interpreted as being
normal: when that particular position stands out and is out of tune with the rest
of the pulse, it usually indicates where the main problem lies.
   The Overflowing quality on the Heart position also indicates that, as a
consequence of deep emotional stress, Qi rebels upwards towards the chest and
face and the patient would experience a feeling of heat in the face, a sense of
constriction of the throat and a feeling of energy rising to the head.

     Short
   A Short quality on the Heart position also indicates emotional problems
usually deriving from sadness and grief. The Short pulse lacks a ‘wave', that is, it
does not flow smoothly with a wave-like movement towards the wrist; Dr Shen
calls this pulse ‘Sad pulse' as it is nearly always due to this emotion. I frequently
see this pulse in people who are sad from being lonely and who crave love and
aﬀection; this pulse is also seen in people who tend to hide their emotions.
   If both Heart and Lung positions feel Short, this can be due to two causes:
either it is due to sadness as above, or to an accident to the chest. To diﬀerentiate
these two conditions one must refer to the other aspects of diagnosis; for
example, in a case of sadness, the eyes might lack spirit (shen ), the tongue might
be Red on the tip or have a Heart crack and the complexion might be pale.

     Weak
   A Weak position on the Heart pulse often indicates a functional weakness of
the heart and circulation rather than emotional problems, although the two
conditions may of course occur simultaneously. Thus, a Weak pulse on the left
Front position often indicates Heart-Qi, Heart-Yang or Heart-Blood deficiency
and the patient would suﬀer from cold hands, tiredness, slight breathlessness,
slight depression and palpitations. If the Heart position is very Weak while the
other pulses are not Weak and there is a Heart crack on the tongue, these signs
indicate a constitutional weakness of the Heart.

     Floating
   A pulse that is Floating in one position only is not so floating as the Floating
pulse seen in external invasions of Wind. When the pulse is Floating only in one
position (that is not the Lung position), it does not indicate an exterior invasion
of Wind but a pathology of that particular organ. In mild invasions of external
Wind, the pulse may be Floating only on the Lung position.
   A Floating quality on the Heart pulse often indicates a problem with the
heart itself. For example, a Floating-Hollow quality felt on the lateral and medial
side of the pulse position may indicate high blood pressure. A Floating-Weak-
Hollow quality indicates that the heart is dilated; this occurs often in people who
jog for long distances every day. A Floating-Tight-Hollow quality may indicate
hardening of the arteries.

     Slippery
   A Slippery quality on the Heart position, especially on its medial and lateral
sides, often indicates heart disease; in such a case, the pulse on the heart position
is often Deep, Fine and Slippery.
     Hollow
   If the whole pulse is Hollow this of course indicates loss of blood, but the
significance is diﬀerent if only the Heart position is Hollow. In such a case, it
usually denotes that the heart is permanently dilated or enlarged, often from
excessive jogging. If the pulse feels Hollow and Overflowing with strength on
the distal or proximal side of the Heart position, this may indicate
arteriosclerosis, stroke or high blood pressure.

     Choppy
   A Choppy quality on the Heart position indicates Heart-Blood deficiency
often deriving from emotional problems such as sadness. If both the Heart and
Liver positions are Choppy, this indicates general deficiency of Blood which may
derive from other than emotional causes (such as overwork or childbirth).

     Wiry
   A Wiry quality on the Heart position usually indicates stagnation in the
chest. If the pulse is Wiry and strong,it indicates stagnation of Qi in the chest
with the patient most probably suﬀering from chest pain. If it is Wiry but Fine
and Rapid, this may indicate that the heart has been aﬀected by shock. If both
the Heart and Lung positions are Wiry with strength, this may indicate
stagnation of Qi in the chest, probably due to a previous accident or blow to the
chest.
   Box 50.38 summarizes the left Front pulse position.

            BOX 50.38         LEFT-FRONT POSITION
         (HEART)
            • Overflowing: Deep emotional problems (anxiety, worry), Qi
         rebelling upwards
            • Short: sadness or grief, accident to chest
            • Weak: functional weakness of the heart and circulation,
         Heart-Qi, Heart-Yang or Heart-Blood deficiency
            • Floating: possibly a heart problem, high blood pressure
         (Floating-Hollow on lateral and medial side), heart dilated

         (Hollow-Overflowing) hardening of arteries, stroke, high blood
         pressure
            • Choppy: Heart-Blood deficiency usually from sadness,

      accident to the chest (both Heart and Lung positions Wiry)

    Left Middle Position (Liver)
   The structure of the left Middle position is illustrated in Figure 50.3 .

                                                                   L@tt lobe/

      FIG. 50.3   Structure of left Middle pulse position
   The left Middle position corresponds to the Liver and Gall-Bladder and there
is li le disagreement on this by various authors.

    Floating
   A Floating quality on this position is quite common and it usually indicates
Liver-Yang rising or Liver-Qi rebelling horizontally. Of course, this assumes that
the pulse is Floating only in this position and not Floating in general and that
there are not symptoms and signs of an exterior invasion of Wind.
   If the pulse feels Floating and Wiry on the Liver position, this indicates Liver-
Yang rising; if it is Floating but Weak and slightly Hollow, it indicates stagnation
of Liver-Qi in the epigastrium and hypochondrium.

    Deep
   If the pulse on the Liver position is Deep and Slippery, this indicates Phlegm
aﬀecting the Liver and Gall-Bladder. If it is Deep, Wiry and Slippery, it indicates
Gall-Bladder disease. If it is Deep and Weak, it indicates Liver-Blood deficiency.

    Slippery
   A Slippery quality on the Liver pulse indicates poor liver function due to
aﬄiction from Phlegm. If the pulse is Slippery on the proximal side of the pulse
position, this indicates Dampness in the Gall-Bladder. If it is Slippery and Wiry
on the proximal side, it may indicate the presence of gall-bladder stones (in
which case there may also be small blood spots on the sclera of the eyes).

    Overflowing
   An Overflowing quality on the Liver position indicates Liver-Yang rising or
Liver-Fire blazing.

    Wiry
   A Wiry quality on the Liver position is very common as this quality is
indicative of Liver disharmonies. If it is Wiry but also ‘stagnant', (i.e. without a
wave but strong), this indicates repressed anger.
   If both left and right Middle positions are Wiry it indicates rebellious Liver-
Qi invading the Stomach.
   Box 50.39 summarizes the left Middle pulse position.

          BOX 50.39               LEFT MIDDLE POSITION
      (LIVER)
          • Floating: Liver-Yang rising or Liver-Qi rebelling horizontally,
      stagnation of Liver-Qi (Floating-Weak and slightly Hollow)
          • Deep: Phlegm in Liver and Gall-Bladder, Gall-Bladder
      disease (Deep-Wiry-Slippery), Liver-Blood deficiency (Deep-Weak)
          • Slippery: Liver aﬀected by Phlegm, Dampness in the Gall-
      Bladder (Slippery on the proximal side), gall-bladder stones
      (Slippery-Wiry on the proximal side)
          • Overflowing: Liver-Yang rising or Liver-Fire blazing
          • Wiry: Liver disharmony, repressed anger (Wiry-Stagnant),
      Liver-Qi invading the Stomach (both Middle positions Wiry)

    Left Rear Position (Kidney)
   The structure of the left Rear position is illustrated in Figure 50.4 . The left
Rear position reflects the state of the Kidneys, Large Intestine, Bladder and
Uterus.

     FIG. 50.4   Structure of left Rear pulse position

    Floating
   A Floating quality with strength usually relates to Large Intestine problems,
whereas a Floating quality without strength usually reflects Kidney problems.
   A Floating, Fine, Wiry and Rapid quality on the left Rear position indicates
stagnation in the Large Intestines with Damp-Heat. A Floating, Weak quality
indicates weak Kidneys. In a woman, a Floating-Wiry quality here indicates
Blood-Heat in the Uterus. A Floating-Rapid quality on the left Kidney position in
a pregnant woman indicates the danger of miscarriage.

    Deep
   A Deep quality here usually indicates Kidney deficiency and especially
Kidney-Yang deficiency; it is an extremely common quality at the Kidney
position, especially after the age of 40, and is more often met in women. Two
factors should be taken into account when judging whether this position is Deep
or not: first, it is normal for this position to be deeper than the Front and Middle
ones, and secondly, it is normal for this position to be somewhat deeper in
winter.
   A Deep, Fine and Weak quality on the left Kidney position indicates a severe
deficiency of the Kidneys; if, in addition, it is also Slow, this indicates a severe
deficiency of Kidney-Yang.
   If the pulse is Deep, Full and Slippery on the distal side, this indicates
Dampness in the Large Intestine. If it is Deep, Weak and Slippery in the same
position, it indicates weak Large Intestine-Qi and diarrhoea.

     Slippery
   A Slippery quality on the Kidney position usually indicates retention of
Dampness in the Kidneys and Bladder. According to Dr Shen, a Slippery pulse
in this position in men may indicate the tendency to have frequent nocturnal
emissions.
   If the pulse is Slippery, Deep and Full on the distal side (Large Intestine), this
indicates Dampness in the Large Intestine and possibly diarrhoea; if it is
Slippery, Deep and Weak, it indicates weak Large Intestine-Qi and possibly
diarrhoea.
   If the pulse is Slippery on the proximal side (Uterus), this indicates
pregnancy if the Heart pulse is strong and amenorrhoea if the Heart pulse is
weak.

     Weak
   A Weak quality on the left Kidney position is extremely common in both men
and women, especially after 40, and it indicates a Kidney deficiency. In men it
may be due to excessive sexual activity, whereas in women it may be due to
having had too many children too close together, to menorrhagia, or to
hysterectomy; in both men and women it is often due to overwork.
   If the left Kidney pulse is Weak and Intermi ent this indicates a deficiency of
the Kidneys and the Original Qi; it may be due to excessive sexual activity (or
indeed any level of sexual activity) before puberty.

     Fine
   A Fine pulse on the Kidney position indicates deficiency of the Original Qi
and Essence; in men, this may be due to excessive sexual activity (including
masturbation).
   If this pulse is Fine, Hidden and Wiry, it indicates inflammation in the Large
Intestine.

     Overflowing
   An Overflowing quality here is usually related to the Intestines rather than
the Kidneys: it indicates Heat in the Large Intestine. If it is Overflowing on both
left and right Kidney positions, this may indicate prostatic hypertrophy.

    Hollow
   A Hollow quality on the Kidney position is usually seen in diabetes when the
patient has been on insulin for many years.
   Box 50.40 summarizes the left Rear pulse position.

      of the Large Intestine (Fine-Hidden-Wiry)
          • Overflowing: Heat in the Large Intestine, prostatic
      hypertrophy (Overflowing on both left and right Rear positions)
          • Hollow: diabetes after long-tem insulin administration

      FIG. 50.5   Structure of right Front pulse position
   The right Front position reflects the state of the Lungs. It should be
remembered that the Lung pulse is naturally quite soft and this should be taken
into account when identifying a particular pathological quality especially the
full-type ones: in other words, a Tight or Wiry or Slippery quality on the Lung
pulse is less obvious than in other positions. Thus, a quality that might be
considered ‘Slippery' or ‘Tight' on the Lung pulse may be normal for other pulse
positions.
   When feeling the Lung pulse, we should also check a position distal and
medial to it which Dr Shen calls the ‘special' Lung pulse (Fig. 50.6 ). In normal
conditions, there is no pulse in this position. If the ‘special' Lung pulse is present
while the Lung pulse itself is Weak, this indicates that the patient had a lung
disease as a child, or that the parents had a lung disease, possibly TB of the
lungs, and that these factors have adversely aﬀected the patient' lungs. If a
‘special' Lung pulse can be felt but the Lung pulse itself is normal, this indicates
either that the patient has suﬀered a lung disease during childhood (e.g.
whooping cough, pneumonia) or that the parents had suﬀered from a lung
disease (e.g. TB of the lungs). If the ‘special' Lung pulse is soft and the Lung
pulse itself normal, this indicates a past problem in the lung. If the ‘special' Lung
pulse is Floating, this indicates a present problem in the lungs, such as asthma or
TB. If the ‘special' Lung pulse is Slippery and the Lung pulse itself normal, this
indicates retention of old Phlegm in the lungs. If the ‘special' Lung pulse is
Slippery and Weak and the Lung pulse itself also Weak, it may indicate TB of the
lungs.

      FIG. 50.6   ‘Special' Lung pulse (distal and medial location)

     Floating
   A Floating quality on the Lung position is very commonly seen in invasions
of external Wind; if the pathogenic factor is particularly strong, the pulse will be
Floating in all positions. A Floating-Tight quality on this position indicates
invasion of Wind-Cold with prevalence of Cold, a Floating-Slow quality
indicates invasion of Wind-Cold with prevalence of Wind, and a Floating-Rapid
quality indicates invasion of Wind- Heat.
   If the pulse in this position is Floating but Weak, this indicates a previous
invasion of Wind with retention of a residual pathogenic factor in the Interior. If
it is Floating, Hollow and soft, it indicates stagnation of Qi in the Lungs from
emotional problems.

     Slippery
   A Slippery quality on the Lung position indicates retention of Phlegm in the
Lungs.

     Overflowing
   An Overflowing quality on the Lung position indicates Lung-Heat. In the
absence of Heat signs, a relatively Overflowing quality in this position indicates
emotional problems deriving from grief or worry.

     Hollow
   A Hollow quality with strength indicates that there might be bleeding in the
lungs; if it is also Rapid, this indicates a forthcoming bleeding in the lungs.

     Right Middle Position (Stomach And Spleen)
   The structure of the right Middle position is illustrated in Figure 50.7 .

      FIG. 50.7   Structure of right Middle pulse position
   As explained in the introduction to pulse diagnosis, the terms ‘external' and
‘internal' describing the diﬀerent location of Yang and Yin organs on the pulse
can be interpreted in three ways: they can mean superficial and deep, lateral and
medial, or distal and proximal. In the case of the right Middle position, the most
widely used interpretations are the first two, that is, the Stomach is felt on the
surface or lateral side, and the Spleen at the deep level or medial side. However,
in the case of Stomach and Spleen, more than any other Yin—Yang organ
systems, the relationship between the two is extremely close so that the pulse
position needs to be taken as a whole indicating the state of the Earth Element;
the diﬀerentiation between Stomach and Spleen should be seen not mechanically
but dynamically according to clinical manifestations. As a rough rule of thumb,
full-type qualities on this position reflect a Stomach pathology whereas empty-
type ones reflect a Spleen pathology.

    Floating
   A Floating quality on this position is very common and it always reflects a
Stomach pathology. It usually indicates Stomach-Heat or Qi stagnation in the
Stomach: when the Stomach pulse is Floating, the patient experiences a
pronounced feeling of distension in the epigastrium.
   If the pulse is slightly Floating but empty at the deep level, it indicates
Stomach-Yin deficiency; this quality is also frequently seen in practice.

    Wiry
   A Wiry quality on the right Middle position indicates stagnation of Qi in the
Stomach, usually from dietary irregularities such as eating too much, eating in a
hurry, eating under stress, etc. If Wiry on the distal position, this may indicate
hiatus hernia. If both Middle positions are Wiry, this indicates that rebellious
Liver-Qi is invading the Stomach.

    Weak
   A Weak quality on this position is extremely common and it usually indicates
a Spleen deficiency. If the pulse feels very Weak on the Stomach position but
slightly Wiry on its proximal side (when rolling the finger very slightly
proximally) this may indicate a prolapse of the Stomach. A Stomach prolapse
may cause considerable digestive problems even when it is minimal and the
pulse reflects this accurately: the patient experiences a poor digestion, feels
sleepy after eating, suﬀers a feeling of heaviness of the epigastrium and is very
tired in general.
   If the pulse is Weak, relatively Floating and Hollow, this indicates Stomach-
Yin deficiency with slight Qi stagnation; the patient experiences excessive
stomach acidity and pronounced epigastric distension.
   If the pulse is Weak, and very slightly Wiry, and the Lung pulse is Weak, it
may indicate a stomach ulcer.
   If both right and left Middle positions are Weak, Deep and Slow, this
indicates a deficiency of Stomach and Spleen

     Fine
   A Fine quality on the right Middle position is common, and indicates a
deficiency of both Spleen and Stomach. If it is Fine, Deep and very slightly Wiry,
this may indicate a stomach ulcer; if it is Fine, Deep, Slippery and Rapid, it
indicates Damp-Heat in the Stomach and Spleen.

     Slippery
   A Slippery quality on this position indicates Dampness or Phlegm: Dampness
may aﬀect both Spleen and Stomach, whereas Phlegm usually aﬀects only the
Stomach. If the pulse is Slippery and Full, this usually indicates Phlegm in the
Stomach; if it is Slippery but Weak and relatively soft, it indicates chronic
Dampness in the Spleen.

     Soggy
   A Soggy quality on this position is common and it indicates chronic
Dampness in the Spleen: with Spleen-Qi deficiency; it is frequently seen in
postviral fatigue syndrome.

     Hollow
   A Hollow quality on the right Middle position indicates bleeding in the
stomach; if the pulse is Hollow and Rapid, it may indicate a forthcoming
stomach haemorrhage.
   Box 50.42 summarizes the right Middle pulse position.

          BOX 50.42        RIGHT MIDDLE POSITION

      hiatus hernia (Wiry on distal position), rebellious Liver-Qi
      invading the Stomach (both Middle positions Wiry)
          • Weak: Spleen-Qi deficiency, prolapse of the Stomach (Weak
      on the main position and slightly Wiry on the proximal side),
      Stomach-Yin deficiency (Weak-Floating-Hollow), stomach ulcer
      (Weak and slightly Wiry, with Weak Lung pulse), deficiency of
      Stomach and Spleen (Weak-Deep-Slow on both Middle positions)
          • Fine: deficiency of Stomach and Spleen, stomach ulcer (Fine-
      Deep and very slightly Wiry), Damp-Heat in Stomach and Spleen
      (Fine-Deep-Slippery-Rapid)
          • Slippery: Dampness or Phlegm in the Stomach (Slippery-
      Full) or Dampness in Spleen (Slippery-Weak)

      deficiency

      haemorrhage (Hollow-Rapid)

     Right Rear Position (Small Intestine And Kidneys)
   The structure of the right Rear position is illustrated in Figure 50.8 . This
position reflects the state of the Kidneys, Small Intestine and Lower Burner.

      FIG. 50.8   Structure of right rear pulse position

     Floating
   A Floating quality on the right Rear position usually reflects a pathology of
the Small Intestine (i.e. Heat in the Small Intestine).

     Weak
   A Weak quality on the right Rear position usually reflects a deficiency of the
Kidneys. If the pulse is Deep and Weak it usually indicates a deficiency of
Kidney- Yang.

     Slippery
   A Slippery quality on the right Rear position usually reflects a pathology of
the Small Intestine (i.e. Dampness). If it is Slippery and Wiry it indicates Damp-
Heat in the Small Intestine with Qi stagnation; this pulse quality on both rear
positions is frequently seen in ulcerative colitis. If the pulse is Slippery but Deep
and slightly Weak, this indicates retention of Dampness in the Small Intestine
and Kidneys.

     Wiry
   A Wiry quality on the right Rear position usually reflects a pathology of the
Small Intestine and particularly indicates Qi stagnation. If the pulse in this
position is Wiry, Long and Rapid it indicates Damp-Heat and Qi stagnation in
the Small Intestine; this pulse picture is frequently seen in ulcerative colitis. If the
pulse is Wiry but Fine and Rapid, this indicates Damp-Heat in the Small
Intestine occurring against a background of Kidney deficiency.

  PULSE QUALITIES INDICATING
DANGEROUS CONDITIONS
   Traditionally, there are 10 pulse qualities that indicate dangerous conditions
and a poor prognosis. These dangerous qualities are:

          • Boiling cauldron pulse
          • Circling fish pulse
          • Swimming shrimp pulse
          • Leaking roof pulse
          • Pecking bird pulse
          • Untying rope pulse
          • Bouncing stone pulse
          • Upturned knife pulse
          • Spinning bean pulse
          • Sesame seed hasty pulse.

     Boiling cauldron pulse
   This pulse is in the skin, floating and extremely rapid so that it cannot be
counted. It feels like water boiling furiously in a cauldron; it is without root.
   This pulse indicates extreme Heat in the three Yang and complete drying up
of Yin.

     Circling fish pulse
   This pulse is in the skin, it is like a fish with the head still and the tail waving
and shaking; it is sometimes there and sometimes not. It is also extremely rapid.
   This pulse indicates extreme Cold in the three Yin and Collapse of Yang.

     Swimming shrimp pulse
   This pulse is in the skin but its shape is somewhat hidden; sometimes it
comes, sometimes it does not; it jumps and darts like a shrimp.
   This pulse indicates collapse of both Yin and Yang.

     Leaking roof pulse
   This pulse is in between the muscles and sinews, it is like water dripping, one
drop at a time, at long, uneven intervals, each drop splashing without strength.
   This pulse indicates collapse of Qi of the Stomach and Spleen.

     Pecking bird pulse
   This pulse is in between the muscles and sinews, it is rapid and irregular,
stopping and starting. It is like a bird pecking at food three then five times in a
row, stopping and starting at irregular intervals.
   This pulse indicates exhaustion of Spleen-Qi and of Food-Qi (Gu Qi ).

     Untying rope pulse
   This pulse is in between the muscles and sinews; it is rapid and chaotic
beating at irregular intervals.
   This pulse indicates collapse of Kidney-Qi.

     Bouncing stone pulse
   This pulse is in between the muscles and sinews and is like a finger tapping
hard on a stone at irregular intervals.
   This pulse denotes exhaustion of Kidney-Water.

     Upturned knife pulse
   This pulse is like the blade of a knife upside down; it is thin but hard and
tense. On the superficial level it is thin, hard and tense and at the deep level it is
large, hard and tense.
   This pulse indicates exhaustion of Liver- and Kidney-Yin.

     Spinning bean pulse
   This pulse feels as it is were spinning, it is short and moving and feels like
Coix seeds (Yi Yi Ren Semen Coicis lachryma jobi ). It feels also like rolling pearls.
   This pulse indicates exhastion of all the Internal Organs.

     Sesame seed hasty pulse
   This pulse is rapid and stops at irregular intervals (like the Hasty pulse); it is
small and shaped like a sesame seed.
   This pulse indicates exhaustion of Qi and Blood.
   A common characteristic of most of the danger pulse qualities is the
irregularity of the beat; they therefore indicate a pathology of the heart in a
Western sense. Many of them are also rapid indicating not necessarily Heat but a
complete collapse of Qi and Blood, which makes the pulse rapid.

     THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS ON THE
PULSE
   I list below some drugs and their eﬀect on the pulse. This list is not
comprehensive but is limited only to the eﬀects I have observed in clinical
practice. It should be remembered that drugs will not always have the eﬀects
listed below as diﬀerent people react in diﬀerent ways to the same drug. For
example, it is common for antibiotics to cause a partial peeling of the tongue but,
in some patients, they tend to make the coating thick.

     Tranquillizers and hypnotics
   Tranquillizers (anxiolytics) and hypnotics (sleeping pills) have a definite
influence on the pulse. In my experience, they cause what I call the ‘Stagnant'
pulse quality (see above).
   The tranquillizers cause a pulse that feels reluctant to come, as if being
suppressed, and seems unlikely to last; it does not flow smoothly and does not
have a ‘wave'. It is somewhat Wiry but it does not have the strength or wave of a
truly Wiry pulse.

     Antidepressants

     Tricyclic antidepressants
   Tricyclic antidepressants tend to cause the pulse to lose its ‘root', that is, it
becomes slightly empty at the deep level and very slightly Floating.

     Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI)
   SSRI antidepressants tend to cause Qi stagnation in the digestive system and
aﬀect the Stomach and Spleen. The Stomach and Spleen pulse position tends to
become somewhat Slippery or Wiry, or both.
     Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI)
   These antidepressants tend to aﬀect the Liver and often cause Liver-Yang
rising. They tend to make the pulse Wiry.

     Beta blockers
   Beta blockers are probably the drugs with the clearest eﬀect on the pulse.
They make the pulse slow and this should definitely be taken into account, lest
we conclude wrongly that the patient suﬀers from a Cold syndrome. They also
tend to make the pulse Deep and somewhat Weak. In my experience, this type of
drug makes pulse reading very diﬃcult and I almost tend to discount the pulse
altogether when a patient is on beta blockers.

     ACE inhibitors
   ACE inhibitors aﬀects the Kidneys and make the pulse Deep and Weak on
both Rear positions.

     Warfarin
   Warfarin tends to make the pulse relatively Overflowing and slightly Empty
at the middle level.

     Diuretics
   Diuretics tend to make the pulse slightly Empty at the deep level. They may
also aﬀect the Kidneysand make the pulse very Weak on both Rear positions.

     H2 -Receptor antagonists
   These drugs tend to aﬀect the Stomach and Spleen and may make the right
Middle position slightly Floating-Empty.

     Insulin
   Long-term use of insulin makes the pulse slightly Slippery but Hollow.
   Box 50.44 summarizes the eﬀects of drugs on the pulse.

   restlessness. He may want to walk about but soon becomes tired. Now

   without fever or aversion to cold. He also has a bi er taste in the mouth
   and the urine is dark. No drugs appear to be eﬀective to cure this
   syndrome; after taking the medicine there may be vomiting and
   diarrhoea. The disease haunts the patient and although his appearance
   is normal, he is actually suﬀering. His pulse is Rapid. ' This apparently
   strange syndrome does occur in practice and is seen in patients who are
   depressed.

    INTRODUCTION
   Palpation is used to detect the temperature, moisture and texture of the skin, the
consistency of the deeper tissues and the presence of masses. Palpation is carried
out on the skin, hands and feet, chest, abdomen and acupuncture points and
channels.
   There are three diﬀerent palpation techniques:

            • touching
            • stroking
          • pressing

     Touching
   This consists simply in touching the skin of the patient lightly. This is done to
detect the temperature and moisture of the skin and to check whether the patient is
sweating. Detecting whether the patient is sweating is important in exterior
invasions of Wind to diﬀerentiate between an A ack of Wind and an A ack of Cold
within the Greater-Yang pa ern of invasion of Wind-Cold. The temperature of the
skin of the forehead is also important in exterior invasions of Wind because it
reflects the intensity of the ‘fever' (or heat emission as defined in Chapter 43 ).

     Stroking
   This consists in stroking the skin and deeper tissues of the patient and it is
usually carried out on the chest, abdomen and limbs. Stroking serves to determine
the presence of tenderness or swelling and it is used to distinguish Full from Empty
conditions.

     Pressing
   This consists in pressing relatively hard to still deeper levels usually of the
abdomen. It serves to determine the presence of pain or masses and is used to
establish the Full or Empty condition of the Internal Organs.
   These three techniques correspond to three diﬀerent degrees of pressures
reflecting the state of diﬀerent energetic layers. Thus, touching reveals the state of
the skin, stroking that of the flesh and muscles and pressing that of the sinews and
bones and of the Internal Organs.

     PALPATION OF THE CHEST AND
ABDOMEN
   Palpation of the chest and abdomen is an important part of diagnosing by
palpation because it reveals the state of the Internal Organs. Chapter 35 of the
‘Spiritual Axis' says: ‘ The internal organs reside inside the chest and abdominal
cavity like precious objects in a chest, each with its own specific location .' 1 The
‘Simple Questions' in Chapter 22 says: ‘ When the Heart is diseased there is pain in
the centre of the chest and hypochondrial fullness and pain … When the Kidneys
are diseased there is swelling of the abdomen .' 2
   The chest and abdominal areas influenced by the various Internal Organs are
illustrated in Figure 51.1 .

      FIG. 51.1   Areas of the chest and abdomen and the Internal Organs

    Temperature
   When palpating the abdomen one should first of all feel the temperature of
diﬀerent areas: if the abdomen feels cold on palpation this indicates either Cold or
Yang deficiency; if it feels hot on palpation this indicates Heat. If the pulse picture
indicates Heat but the abdomen is not hot on palpation, this indicates exter-nal
Heat. In children, a hot sensation of the abdomen on palpation often indicates
retention of food.

    Texture
   Next, one should check the texture of the abdomen, that is, whether it feels soft
or hard. The normal abdomen should feel relatively soft on a superficial palpation
but firm with a deeper pressure. If the abdomen feels very soft and flaccid on
palpation, this indicates a deficiency condition of the Spleen and Stomach if it is the
epigastrium, or the Spleen and Kidneys if the lower abdomen; the la er sign is
common in women who have had several children.
   If the abdomen feels hard on palpation, this indicates a Full condition, which is
usually Qi stagnation, Blood stasis, Dampness or retention of food; each of these
conditions presents with diﬀerent subjective symptoms, which are distension, pain
and fullness respectively.
   Palpation of the abdomen is quite important in invasions of Wind, especially in
children, because if the abdomen feels soft the pathogenic factor is usually still on
the Exterior, whereas if it feels hard the pathogenic factor has penetrated to the
Interior.
   Box 51.1 summarizes the significance of diﬀerent textures on palpation.

            BOX 51.1          TEXTURE OF THE ABDOMEN
            • Soft and flaccid epigastrium: Stomach and Spleen deficiency
            • Soft and flaccid lower abdomen: Spleen and Kidney deficiency
            • Hard: Full condition

                   — stagnation (with feeling of distension)
                   — Dampness (with feeling of fullness)
                   — Blood stasis (with pain)
                   — retention of food (with feeling of
               fullness)
            • Soft during invasions of Wind in children: pathogenic factor
      still on the Exterior
            • Hard during invasions of Wind in children: pathogenic factor in
      the Interior

     Distension versus fullness
   One can distinguish distension from fullness on palpation. Besides being
subjective symptoms, distension and fullness are also objective signs. The
distended abdomen feels hard but elastic, like a drum, whereas fullness of the
abdomen manifests with a hard-ness of the abdomen but without distension on
palpation.

     Tenderness
   The abdomen should then be palpated to check for tenderness and pain. If a
light palpation elicits tenderness or pain, this indicates a Full condition, which may
be Qi stagnation, Blood stasis, Dampness, retention of food, Heat or Cold. If the
pressure of palpation relieves the pain, this indicates a deficient condition of the
Spleen and Stomach if it is in the epigastrium, or of the Spleen, Kidneys and Liver if
in the lower abdo-men. If the abdomen feels tender only under deep pressure, this
usually indicates Blood stasis. If superficial pressure of the abdomen relieves a pain
but deeper pressure elicits a discomfort, this indi-cates a combined condition of
Deficiency and Excess (e.g. stagnation of Liver-Qi with Spleen-Qi deficiency).
   Box 51.2 summarizes the significance of tenderness on palpation.

            BOX 51.2          TENDERNESS ON PALPATION
            • Tenderness on light palpation: Full condition (Qi stagnation,
      Blood stasis, Dampness, Retention of Food, Heat or Cold)
          • Tenderness relieved by palpation: Stomach and Spleen
      deficiency (epigastrium) or Liver and Kidney deficiency (lower
      abdomen)
          • Tender on deep pressure: Blood stasis
          • Tenderness relieved by superficial pressure and elicited by
      deeper pressure: combined Deficiency and Excess

     Lumps
   Abdominal masses are called Ji Ju. Ji indicates actual abdominal masses which
are fixed and immovable; if there is an associated pain, its location is fixed. These
masses are due to stasis of Blood and I call them ‘Blood masses'. Ju indicates
abdominal masses which come and go, do not have a fixed location and are
movable. If there is an associated pain, it too comes and goes and changes location.
Such masses are due to stagnation of Qi and I call them ‘Qi masses'.
   Actual abdominal lumps therefore pertain to the category of abdominal masses
and specifically Ji masses (i.e. Blood masses).
   Another name for abdominal masses was Zheng Jia, Zheng being equivalent to Ji
(i.e. acute, fixed masses) and Jia being equivalent to Ju (i.e. non-substantial masses
from stagnation of Qi). The term Zheng Jia normally referred to abdominal masses
occurring only in women, but although these masses are more frequent in women
they do occur in men as well.
   When palpating the abdomen one should feel for lumps. Lumps that come and
go and are associated with distension indicate Qi stagnation, whereas lumps that
are fixed and painful indicate Blood stasis. Soft and movable abdominal lumps may
indicate Phlegm. Lumps in the left-lower abdominal region may simply indicate
faeces in the colon.
   Palpable lumps in the lower abdomen may be due to Qi stagnation, Blood stasis,
Damp-Phlegm or Damp-Heat.
   Abdominal lumps, if due to Qi stagnation, normally feel soft and come and go
with emotional moods; if due to Blood stasis they feel hard on palpation and are
usually associated with pain; if from Damp-Heat they may also be painful and,
when palpated, very tender; if from Damp-Phlegm, they feel softer than lumps
from Blood stasis or Damp-Heat. A typical example of an abdominal lump from
Blood stasis is a myoma, whereas an example of that from Damp-Phlegm or Damp-
Heat is an ovarian cyst.
   Box 51.3 summarizes the types of abdominal masses.

          BOX 51.3         TWO TYPES OF ABDOMINAL
      MASSES
          • Qi (Ju or Jia ): relatively soft masses that come and go
          • Blood (Ji or Zheng ): hard, fixed masses

     Palpation Of The Chest
   Palpation of the chest includes palpation of the following areas:

         • apical pulse
         • chest
         • area under xyphoid process
         • breast.

     Apical pulse
   The apical pulse can be palpated in the fifth intercostal space; from a Western,
anatomical point of view, it is the palpation of the left ventricle of the heart,
whereas in ancient Chinese medicine it was called the pulsation of Xu Li , which
relates to the Great Connecting channel of the Stomach and reflects the state of the
Gathering Qi (Zong Qi ). For a description of the ancient interpretation of this
pulsation, see Chapter 13 in Part 1 , ‘Diagnosis by Observation'.
   The pulsation of the apical pulse reflects the state of the Gathering Qi and,
under normal conditions, it should be felt clearly but not be hard and it should be
relatively slow; this indicates a normal state of the Gathering Qi. If the pulsation of
the apical pulse is feeble and without strength, this indicates a deficiency of the
Gathering Qi and therefore of Lungs and Heart. If the pulsation feels too strong and
hard, this indicates an Excess condition of the Lungs or Heart, or both. However, in
some cases, when the left ventricle is enlarged, the apical pulse may feel ‘large' but
empty and this indicates Heart-Qi deficiency.
   If the apical pulse stops and starts, this may indicate that the patient has
suﬀered a severe shock; the same sign may also be seen in alcoholism.
   The pulsation of the apical pulse should also be compared with that of the radial
pulse and the two should be similar to each other (e.g. if the apical pulse feels
feeble, the radial pulse should also feel Weak, Empty or Choppy). A discrepancy
between the apical and the radial pulse is a poor prognostic sign and it often
indicates heart disease.
   The apical pulse may become aﬀected by short-term influences such as shock,
fright or a severe outburst of anger in which case it becomes very rapid.
   Box 51.4 summarizes findings on palpation of the apical pulse.

          BOX 51.4         APICAL PULSE
         • Clearly felt, not hard, relatively slow: normal
         • Feeble and without strength: deficiency of the Gathering Qi
      (Zong Qi )
         • Strong and hard: Excess condition of the Lungs and/or Heart
         • Large but empty: Heart-Qi deficiency
         • Stopping and starting: severe shock or alcoholism
         • Discrepancy between apical and radial pulse: poor prognosis
         • Rapid: shock, fright or outburst of anger

     Chest
   The centre of the chest corresponds to the Heart and the rest of it to the Lungs.
Palpation of the chest reveals the state of the Heart, Lungs and Pericardium and
generally speaking, tenderness on palpation indicates a Full condition of one of
these organs. For example, if the chest feels very tender even on light palpation in
the centre, in the area of Ren-17 Shanzhong, this may indicate Heart-Blood stasis.
   If the chest is tender on palpation in the areas around the centre, it usually
indicates an Excess condition of the Lungs and often retention of Phlegm in the
Lungs. By contrast, if palpation of the chest relieves discomfort, it indicates
Deficiency of the Heart or Lungs. If superficial palpation of the chest relieves a pain
but the patient feels discomfort with a deeper pressure, it indicates a combined
condition of Deficiency and Excess.
   Box 51.5 summarizes findings on palpation of the chest.

           BOX 51.5        CHEST
           • Tender with light palpation of Ren-17: Heart-Blood stasis
           • Tender around the centre: Excess condition of the Lungs
           • Tenderness relieved by palpation: Deficiency condition of Heart
      or Lungs
           • Tenderness relieved by light palpation but elicited by deeper
      palpation: combined Deficiency and Excess

    Area under xyphoid process
   The area under the xyphoid process reflects the state of the Stomach, Heart and
Penetrating Vessel. This area readily reflects pa erns deriving from emotional
problems. For example, if the area feels relatively hard and kno ed, this indicates
Heart-Qi stagnation from emotional problems such as sadness and grief. If the area
is soft but painful, it indicates Stomach-Heat combined with Stomach-Qi deficiency.
The Penetrating Vessel also aﬀects this area and a kno ed and full feeling in this
area occurs often in the pa ern of rebellious Qi of the Penetrating Vessel, but only
when it is associated with other abdominal, chest and throat symptoms.
   Box 51.6 summarizes findings on palpation of the area under the xyphoid
process.

           BOX 51.6        AREA UNDER THE XYPHOID
      PROCESS
           • Hard and kno ed: stagnation of Heart-Qi
           • Soft on palpation and painful: Stomach-Heat with Stomach-Qi
      deficiency
           • Hard and full: rebellious Qi of the Penetrating Vessel

    Breast
   Palpation of the breasts in women is carried out when there are breast lumps.
Breast lumps may be malignant or benign. The purpose of palpation in Chinese
medicine is never to replace the Western diagnosis - we should never rely on
palpation to distinguish benign from malignant lumps - but to identify the pa erns
causing them. The palpation of lumps should take into consideration their
hardness, their edges and their mobility:

         • relatively soft: Phlegm
         • relatively hard: Blood stasis
         • distinct edges: Phlegm
         • indistinct edges: Toxic Heat
         • mobile on palpation: Phlegm
         • immovable on palpation: Blood stasis or Toxic Heat.
   Small, movable lumps with distinct edges that change size according to the
menstrual cycle normally indicate fibrocystic disease of the breast, which is usually
due to a combination of Phlegm and Qi stagnation. A single, relatively hard,
movable lump with distinct edges which may be also slightly painful usually
indicates a fibroadenoma, which from the Chinese point of view is due to a
combination of Phlegm and Blood stasis. A single, hard, immovable lump with
indistinct margins, without pain, may indicate carcinoma of the breast which, in
Chinese medicine, is usually due to a combination of Phlegm, Qi stagnation and
Blood stasis occurring against a background of disharmony of the Penetrating and
Directing Vessels.
   Box 51.7 summarizes the causes of the most common breast lumps.

          BOX 51.7       COMMON CAUSES OF BREAST
      LUMPS
         • Fibrocystic disease (Qi stagnation and Phlegm): small, multiple,
      movable lumps with distinct edges, changing size according to the
      menstrual cycle
         • Fibroadenoma (Phlegm and Blood stasis): single, relatively
      hard, movable lump with distinct edges, possibly painful
         • Carcinoma of the breast (Blood stasis and Phlegm): single, hard,
      immovable, painless lump with indistinct margins

    Palpation Of The Abdomen
   The palpation areas of the abdomen are as follows (Fig. 51.2 ):

         • central-lower abdomen.

    Hypochondrium
   The hypochondrium includes the lateral side of the rib cage and also the area
immediately below it. It reflects the state of the Liver and Gall-Bladder. If the
hypochondrium is distinctly tender on palpation, this indicates stagnation of Liver-
Qi, Liver-Blood stasis or Damp-Heat in the Liver and Gall-Bladder. If pal-pation of
the hypochondrium relieves the patient's discomfort, this may indicate Liver-Blood
deficiency.
   Box 51.8 summarizes findings on palpation of the hypochondrium.

          BOX 51.8           HYPOCHONDRIUM
         • Tender on palpation: Liver-Qi stagnation, Liver-Blood stasis,
      Damp-Heat in Liver and Gall-Bladder
         • Discomfort relieved by palpation: Liver-Blood deficiency

    Epigastrium
   The epigastric area is the area contained between the xyphoid process, the costal
margins and the umbilicus. Palpation of the epigastrium reveals primarily the
condition of the Stomach and Spleen. The normal epigastrium should feel elastic
but neither hard nor too soft. The area immediately below the xyphoid process
reflects the condition of both the Stomach and the Heart and should feel relatively
softer than the rest of the epigastrium; if this area feels hard on palpation, it often
indicates stagnation of Qi or Blood of the Heart, which is usually due to emotional
problems.
   If the epigastrium feels hard on palpation, this indicates an Excess condition of
the Stomach, which may be stagnation of Qi, Blood stasis, Dampness or retention of
food. If the epigastrium feels distended like a drum, this indicates Qi stagnation. If
the patient has a subjective sensation of fullness but the epigastrium is soft on
palpation, this indicates a condition of mixed Deficiency and Excess, which is often
characterized by Stomach-Heat and Spleen-Qi deficiency. If pal-pation of the
epigastrium relieves the patient's discomfort, this indicates a Deficiency condition
of the Stomach.
   Box 51.9 summarizes findings on palpation of the epigastrium.

            BOX 51.9      EPIGASTRIUM
         • Elastic, neither hard nor soft: healthy state of Stomach and
      Spleen
         • Hardness in the area below the xyphoid process: stagnation of
      Qi or Blood of the Heart, usually due to emotional problems
         • Hard: Excess condition of the Stomach (Qi stagnation, Blood
      stasis, Dampness or retention of Food)
         • Distended like a drum: Qi stagnation
         • Soft on palpation with subjective sensation of Fullness:
      Stomach-Heat and Spleen-Qi deficiency

    Umbilical region
   The umbilical region reflects the state of the Kidneys and of the Penetrating and
Directing Vessels. It should feel elastic but not hard. If it feels hard and full on
palpation, this indicates either stagnation of Qi or Blood stasis in the Penetrating
Vessel. If it is painful on palpation, this indicates Blood stasis in the Penetrating
Vessel. If it feels very soft on palpation, this indicates a Kidney deficiency and a
deficiency of the Penetrating and Directing Vessels.
   Box 51.10 summarizes findings on palpation of the unbilical region.
          BOX 51.10          UMBILICAL REGION
          • Hard and full: stagnation of Qi or Blood stasis in Penetrating
      Vessel
          • Pain: Blood stasis in the Penetrating Vessel
          • Soft: Kidney deficiency and deficiency of Penetrating and
      Directing Vessels

     Umbilical pulse
   Palpation of the abdomen should always include palpation of the pulse around
the umbilicus by using three fingers and the thumb simultaneously, that is the
middle finger above the umbilicus, the index and ring finger to the right and left
respectively and the thumb below the umbilicus. From the Chinese point of view
this is the pulsation of the Original Qi, which should be strong and regular. If this
pulse pulsates more than five times per breathing cycle, it indicates Heat in the
Penetrating and Directing Vessels. If this pulse feels faint, and there is a feeling of
heat on palpation, it indicates Yin deficiency in the Penetrating Vessel. If this pulse
is slower than two pulsations per breathing cycle it indicates a severe deficiency of
the Original Qi. If the pulsation around the umbilicus is slow and it feels cold on
palpation, it indicates a deficiency of the Fire of the Gate of Life.
   Box 51.11 summarizes findings on palpation of the umbilical pulse.

          B O X 5 1 . 11     UMBILICAL PULSE
          • Strong and regular umbilical pulse: healthy Original Qi
          • Umbilical pulse which beats more than five times per breathing
      cycle: Heat in the Penetrating and Directing Vessels
          • Faint umbilical pulse with a feeling of heat on palpation: Yin
      deficiency in the Penetrating Vessel
          • Umbilical pulse slower than two pulsations per breathing cycle:
      severe deficiency of the Original Qi
          • Slow umbilical pulse with a feeling of cold on palpation:
      deficiency of the Fire of the Gate of Life

     Lateral-lower abdomen
   The lateral-lower abdominal areas are called Shao Fu and they reflect the state of
the Intestines and of the Penetrating Vessel. If hard on palpation, they indi-cate
either Dampness in the Intestines or Blood stasis in the Penetrating Vessel. If
painful on palpation, they indicate Blood stasis in the Penetrating Vessel. A feeling
of mass in the lateral lower abdomen also indicates Blood stasis in the Intestines or
in the Penetrating Vessel.
   Box 51.12 summarizes findings on palpation of the lateral-lower area.

          BOX 51.12          LATERAL-LOWER ABDOMEN
           • Hard: Dampness in Intestines or Blood stasis in Penetrating

           • Feeling of mass: Blood stasis in the Intestines or Penetrating
      Vessel

     Central-lower abdomen
   The central-lower abdominal area is called Xiao Fu and it reflects the state of the
Small Intestine, Kidneys, Bladder, Uterus and Liver. If this area feels hard on
palpation, it may indicate Dampness in the Intestines or Bladder. If it is painful on
palpation, it may indicate Qi stagnation or Blood stasis in the Intestines or Bladder.
   Box 51.13 summarizes findings on palpation of the central-lower area.

           BOX 51.13        CENTRAL-LOWER ABDOMEN
           • Hard: Dampness in the Small Intestine or Bladder
           • Pain: Qi stagnation of Blood stasis in Small Intestine or Bladder

     PALPATION OF THE SKIN
   Palpation of the skin includes palpation of the body skin and palpation of the
forearm. Palpation of the skin includes the following areas:

           • body skin
           • forearm diagnosis
           • palpation of temples in children.

     Body Skin
   Palpation of the body skin is aimed at assessing its temperature, moistness and
texture.

     Temperature
   The temperature of the skin reflects conditions of Heat or Yang deficiency. If the
skin feels hot on palpation it usually indicates a condition of Heat, whereas if it
feels Cold this indicates Yang deficiency or Cold. Sometimes the pulse is Rapid but
the abdomen does not feel hot; this indicates external Heat. A hot abdomen in
children indicates retention of food.
   Box 51.14 summarizes findings of heat and cold on palpation.

           BOX 51.14        TEMPERATURE
           • Cold: Cold or Yang deficiency
           • Hot: Heat
           • Pulse Rapid but abdomen not hot: external Heat
           • Hot abdomen in children: retention of food
    Energetic layers
   A hot feeling of the skin on palpation may be related more specifically to the
five energetic layers of skin, muscles, blood vessels, sinews and bones according to
the amount of pressure exerted. These five energetic layers reflect the state of the
Lungs, Spleen, Heart, Liver and Kidneys and they may be grouped into three, (i.e.
skin, muscles and blood vessels, and sinews and bones), corresponding to three
diﬀerent pressures of palpation.

         There are three energetic layers of palpation:
         • skin
         • muscles and blood vessels
         • sinews and bones.

    Skin
   The skin energetic layer is felt by palpating very lightly; if it feels hot on
palpation and the feeling of heat subsides after several minutes, this indicates
exterior Heat from invasion of Wind or Empty-Heat from Yin deficiency aﬀecting
the Lungs.

    Muscles and blood vessels
   The muscles and blood vessels energetic layer is felt by palpating the skin with a
slightly harder pressure; if it feels hot at this level, this indicates interior Heat
aﬀecting the Heart or Spleen.

    Sinews and bones
   The sinews and bones energetic layer is felt by palpating the skin with a still
harder pressure; if it feels hot at this level, this indicates Empty-Heat from Yin
deficiency usually aﬀecting the Liver and Kidneys.
   Box 51.15 summarizes findings on palpation of the energetic layers.

           BOX 51.15       PALPATION OF SKIN
      ENERGETIC LAYERS
         • Skin hot: Wind-Heat or Empty Heat from Yin deficiency
         • Muscles and blood vessels hot: interior Heat in Heart or Spleen
         • Sinews and bones hot: Empty Heat from Yin deficiency of Liver
      or Kidneys

    Moisture
   Palpation of the skin should take into consideration the moisture of the skin: the
normal skin should be slightly moist and elastic. If the skin is too moist from sweat,
this indicates either Yang deficiency or Heat, whereas if moist and greasy, it
indicates Dampness or Phlegm. If the skin feels dry on palpation, this indicates
Blood deficiency, Yin deficiency or severe Blood stasis. If the skin feels rough on
palpation, this indicates severe Blood deficiency, often as an underlying condition
of Painful Obstruction Syndrome (Bi ).

    Texture
   If the skin feels rough and very dry and scaly, this indicates severe deficiency
and Dryness of Blood together with a deficiency of the Spleen. If the skin feels
swollen on palpation and the exerting of pressure with the thumb leaves it dented,
this indicates oedema from Yang deficiency; if the skin feels swollen but the
exerting of pressure with the thumb does not leave it dented, this indicates Qi
stagnation or Blood stasis.

    Forehead
   Palpating the forehead to feel its temperature was, in ancient China, a method of
ascertaining whether or not the patient was suﬀering from a ‘fever'. An objective
sensation of heat on palpation of the forehead is called fa re , which literally means
‘emission of heat' and which is often translated as ‘fever'; however, this is not
entirely correct as the patient may or may not have a fever. Whenever ‘fever' is
mentioned in this context, it is intended as an objective feeling of heat of the
forehead on palpation. An objective sensation of heat on palpation of the forehead
together with a subjective feeling of aversion to cold indicates invasion of external
Wind; such a sensation together with a subjective feeling of heat indicates internal
Heat.
   The temperature of the forehead should be compared with that of the palms: if
the forehead is ho er than the palms, this generally indicates exterior Heat, while if
the palms are ho er than the forehead, this generally indicates interior Heat.
   Box 51.16 summarizes the findings on palpation of skin.

           BOX 51.16          PALPATION OF SKIN
           • Hot feeling: Heat
           • Cold feeling: Cold or Yang deficiency
           • Moist skin (from sweat): Yang deficiency or Heat
           • Moist and greasy skin: Dampness or Phlegm
           • Dry skin: Blood or Yin deficiency (or severe Blood stasis)
           • Rough skin: Blood deficiency
           • Rough, dry and scaly skin: Blood deficient and dry, Spleen
        deficiency
           • Swollen skin with indentation on pressure: oedema from Yang
        deficiency
           • Swollen without indentation on pressure: Qi stagnation or
        Blood stasis

    Forearm Diagnosis
      Diagnosis by palpating the palmar surface of the forearm between the elbow
and the wrist crease was described in Chapter 74 of the ‘Spiritual Axis', which says:
‘ The rapid or slow, large or small and slippery or rough condition of the skin of the
forearm, as well as the firmness of the muscles, reflects the location of the disease .'
    This quotation refers to palpation of the palmar surface of the forearm. ‘Rapid or
slow' refers to how the hand glides over the patient's skin, that is ‘rapid' means that
the patient's skin is smooth and the practitioner's hand glides easily and ‘slow'
means that the patient's skin is rough and the practitioner's hand does not glide
easily. ‘Large or small' refers to the size of the muscles of this part of the arm and
‘slippery or rough' refers to the texture of the skin of the forearm.
      The same chapter of the ‘Spiritual Axis' says:
          When the skin of the forearm is slippery and moist, it indicates invasion of
       Wind; if it is rough, it indicates Wind Painful Obstruction Syndrome; if it is
       like fish scales, it indicates Phlegm-Fluids; if it feels hot and the pulse is Full,
       it indicates a Heat disease; if the skin is cold and the pulse is small, it
       indicates diarrhoea and deficiency of Qi; if the skin is extremely hot and then
       becomes cold, it indicates combined Heat and Cold; if the skin feels cold but
       becomes gradually ho er on palpation, it also indicates combined Heat and
       Cold. 4
      In other words, the texture of the skin of the inner surface of the forearm reflects
invasions of external Wind if it feels slightly moist, Blood deficiency if it feels dry,
Wind Painful Obstruction syndrome if it feels rough and severe Spleen deficiency
with Phlegm if it feels rough and coarse like fish scales. In addition to this, the
temperature of the skin of the inner forearm reflects conditions of Heat (particularly
of the Intestines) if it feels hot or conditions of Cold (particularly of the Intestines) if
it feels cold.
      The same chapter of the ‘Spiritual Axis' describes the correspondences between
the areas of the forearm and the Internal Organs; these are summarized in Box 51.17
.

Lun ) developed the above topography of the forearm from Chapter 74 of the
‘Spiritual Axis' into a detailed map of correspondence between areas of the inner
forearm and parts of the body (Fig. 51.3 ). 5

          FIG. 51.3   Correspondence between areas of the inner forearm and parts of the body
    Besides palpation, the skin of the inner aspect of the forearm should be observed
for slackness, tightness, moistness, dryness, protrusion and shrinking. If the inner
aspect of the forearm looks slack and loose, it indicates Heat; if it is tight, this
indicates Cold. If the forearm is moist this indicates Wind invasion; if it is dry it
indicates Blood or Yin deficiency. If the forearm skin seems to be protruding and
sticking out this indicates a Full condition; if it looks shrinking and withered it
indicates an Empty condition.

     Palpation Of Temples In Children
    In babies under 6 months, palpation of the temples is used for diagnosis. The
area to palpate is that between the end of the eyebrow and the temple hairline (Fig.
51.4 ).

          FIG. 51.4   Temple palpation in babies
    This area is palpated by gently resting the index, middle and ring fingers
between the end of the eyebrow and the temporal hairline with the ring finger
nearest the end of the eyebrow. The right hand should be used to feel the left side of
the child's temple while the left hand should be used to feel the right side. If this
area feels hot under all three fingers, this indicates an external invasion of Wind; if
it feels cold under all three fingers, this indicates an external invasion of Wind-Cold
or Accumulation Disorder from stagnation in the digestive system. If it feels hot
under the index and middle fingers, this indicates Heat above and Cold below. If it
feels hot under the middle and ring fingers, this indicates Heat from fright. If it
feels hot under the index finger only, this indicates Accumulation Disorder,
stagnation of Qi in the chest or breast-feeding problems. Of course, a hot feeling in
this area also corresponds to the objective feeling of heat called fa re , which may or
may not correspond to an actual fever.
   Finally, the temperature of this area of the baby's forehead should be compared
with that of the palms. If the palms are ho er than the temples, this indicates
Empty-Heat; if the temples are ho er than the palms, this indicates Full Heat.
   Box 51.18 summarizes findings on temple palpation in babies.

             BOX 51.18       TEMPLE PALPATION IN BABIES
             • Hot under three fingers: external invasion of Wind-Heat
             • Cold under three fingers: external invasion of Wind-Cold or
      Accumulation Disorder
             • Hot under index and middle fingers: Heat above, Cold below
             • Hot under middle and ring fingers: Heat from fright
             • Hot under the index finger only: Accumulation Disorder,
      stagnation of Qi in the chest or breast-feeding problems
             • Temples ho er than palms: Full Heat
             • Palms ho er than temples: Empty Heat

     PALPATION OF HANDS AND FEET
Temperature
   Palpation of the hands and feet, particularly in regard to their temperature, is
important to diagnose conditions of Heat and Cold. The most common cause of
cold hands and cold feet is Yang deficiency. Lung- or Heart-Yang deficiency, or
both, will cause coldness of the hands only. Kidney-Yang deficiency will cause
coldness of the feet; if associated with Spleen-Yang deficiency, the hands may be
cold as well. Stomach-Yang deficiency may cause coldness of both hands and feet.
With Spleen- and Kidney-Yang deficiency a particular feature is that not only the
hands and feet but the whole limbs are cold.
   In women, cold hands and feet may also be caused by Blood deficiency. Heart-
Blood deficiency may cause cold hands, whereas Liver-Blood deficiency may cause
cold feet.
   Stagnation of Liver-Qi may cause coldness of the hands and feet but particularly
of the fingers and toes. In this case, the cold feeling is due not to a Yang deficiency
but to Qi that is stagnant being unable to reach the extremities.
         In cold hands and feet from Liver-Qi stagnation, it is the fingers
      and toes particularly that are cold.
   There are other less common causes of cold hands and feet. One is Phlegm in
the Interior, which may obstruct the circulation of Qi to the limbs and cause cold
hands; this may happen also in the case of Phlegm-Heat giving rise to contradictory
hot and cold symptoms. Another less common situation of cold hands and feet is
when there is a very pronounced and intense Heat in the Interior obstructing the
circulation of Qi so that it cannot warm the hands and feet; this condition will also
give rise to contradictory hot and cold symptoms. An example of this situation is
the condition of Heat in the Pericardium at the Nutritive-Qi level within the Four
Levels, which is characterized by symptoms and signs of intense Heat (i.e. dark-
Red tongue without coating, fever at night, mental restlessness, etc.) but cold
hands.
   Box 51.19 summarizes the causes of cold hands and feet.

          BOX 51.19        COLD HANDS AND FEET
          Common causes
         • Cold hands: Lung/Heart-Yang deficiency
         • Cold feet: Kidney-Yang deficiency
         • Cold of whole limbs: Spleen- and Kidney-Yang deficiency
         • Cold hands and feet: Stomach-Yang deficiency, Kidney- with
      Spleen-Yang deficiency
         • Cold hands and feet in women: Blood deficiency
         • Cold hands in women: Heart-Blood deficiency
         • Cold feet in women: Liver-Blood deficiency
         • Cold fingers and toes: Liver-Qi stagnation
          Less common cause
         • Cold hands and feet: Phlegm or Interior Heat obstructing
      circulation of Qi
         • Contradictory hot and cold symptoms: Phlegm-Heat or intense
      interior Heat

    Palpation And Comparison Of Dorsum And Palm
   When palpating the hands to feel their temperature, we should distinguish
between the dorsum and the palm of the hand: a hot dorsum reflects more
conditions of Full-Heat, whereas a hot palm reflects more conditions of Empty-
Heat, though not exclusively so.

         Hot dorsum of the hand indicates Full-Heat; a hot palm usually
      indicates Empty-Heat.
   In the context of exterior invasions of Wind, palpation of the dorsum of the
hands is important because it confirms the exterior nature of the condition. In fact,
in exterior invasions of Wind (whether Wind-Cold or Wind-Heat) there is the
characteristic contradiction between the patient's subjective sensation of cold
(‘aversion to cold') or even shivering and the objective hot feeling of the dorsum of
the hands on palpation. The Chinese term fa re , which is often translated as ‘fever'
in the context of exterior invasions of Wind, actually refers precisely to this (i.e. the
objective hot feeling of the dorsum of the hands and forehead on palpation); the
patient may or may not have an actual fever.
   Therefore, the comparison between the temperature of the dorsum and the
palms of the hands has two interpretations: on the one hand, it helps to distinguish
Full- from Empty-Heat; on the other, in the context of acute diseases it confirms
their exterior nature.
   Chapter 74 of the ‘Spiritual Axis' relates the temperature of the palm of the hand
to the condition of the Intestines: if the palm is hot, this indicates Heat in the
Intestines, whereas if cold it indicates Cold in the Intestines. 6

     Palpation Of Feet And Hands In Children
   In children, conditions of Heat are normally reflected on the soles of the feet,
which become hot, whereas conditions of Cold are normally reflected on the
dorsum of the foot and on the leg, which become cold. Also in children, cold tips of
the fingers may indicate shock or fright, whereas if the middle section of the fingers
is hot this indicates an external invasion of Wind.

     Palpation Of The Nails
   Palpation of the hands should include pressing of the nails. When a fingernail is
pressed, a white discoloration appears. Under normal conditions, the nail should
resume its normal pinky colour as soon as the pressure is released. If the
resumption of the normal pinky colour occurs slowly, this indicates either Blood
deficiency or Blood stasis.

     PALPATION OF ACUPUNCTURE POINTS
   Palpation of acupuncture points is aimed primarily at checking for tenderness.
If a point is very tender on even superficial pressure, this indicates a Full condition
of that channel or local stagnation. If pressure on the point relieves a particular
pain, this indicates an Empty condition of that channel. If pressure of the point
initially relieves a particular pain but then causes a discomfort, this indicates a
condition of mixed Deficiency and Excess.
   Any acupuncture point may be used diagnostically, and indeed the Ah Shi
points may be used as well. However, some points have a particular diagnostic
significance; these are the Front Collecting (Mu ) points, the Back Transporting (Shu
) points and the Source (Yuan ) points.

     Front Collecting (Mu ) Points
   With a single exception, the Front Collecting points are all located on the chest
and abdomen. The Chinese character Mu literally means to ‘raise, collect, enlist,
recruit'. In this context, it has the meaning of collecting, that is, these are the points
where the Qi of the relevant organs collects or gathers. These points are frequently
used in palpation diagnosis because they easily become tender on palpation or even
spontaneously when the relevant organ is diseased. They are used diagnostically
particularly, but not exclusively, in acute conditions. For example, the point LU-1
Zhongfu will be tender in acute lung diseases, such as bronchitis; however, the
same point may also be tender in chronic asthma.
   The Front-Collecting points are listed in Box 51.20 .

          • Pericardium: Ren-17 Shanzhong
          • Triple Burner: Ren-5 Shimen
          • Gall-Bladder: GB-24 Riyue
          • Liver: LIV-14 Qimen

     LU-1 Zhongfu
   This point is particularly useful to diagnose conditions of Emptiness or Fullness
of the Lung in interior diseases, such as acute or chronic bronchitis, asthma and
emphysema. LU-2 Yunmen is also frequently tender on palpation in the same
conditions.

     ST-25 Tianshu
   This point is a very important point in abdominal diagnosis because it readily
reflects Full or Empty conditions not only of the Large Intestine, of which it is the
Front Collecting point, but also of the Small Intestine. ST-25 is also often the centre
of stagnation of Qi or Blood stasis in the Intestines, in which case the abdomen feels
distended on palpation. This point is also one where Dampness in the Intestines
frequently accumulates, in which case it will feel hard on palpation.

     Ren-12 Zhongwan
   This point is an extremely important point which should always be palpated
because it reflects Full or Empty conditions of the Stomach. A distended feeling on
palpation indicates stagnation of Qi, a hard feeling on palpation indicates
Dampness or retention of food, whereas if the point feels very soft on palpation and
the hand sinks down easily this indicates a condition of deficiency of the Stomach.
When palpating Ren-12, other associated points should be palpated because they
all reflect the state of the Stomach; these points are ST-20 Chengman, KI-17
Shangqu and ST-21 Liangmen.

     LIV-13 Zhangmen
   This point reflects Full and Empty conditions of the Spleen and one can
frequently feel a feeling of distension on palpation of this point, which indicates
stagnation of Qi in the Spleen. When palpating LIV-13, other associated points
indicating the state of the Spleen should also be palpated and especially KI-18
Shiguan, Ren-9 Shuifen and ST-21 Liangmen.

     Ren-14 Juque
   This point is very important to palpate because it readily reflects Full and
Empty conditions of the Heart, especially when caused by emotional problems. The
consistency and feeling of the area around this point should be compared and
contrasted with that of the lower abdomen around Ren-6 Qihai: the area around
Ren-14 should feel relatively soft compared with the area around Ren-6, which
should not be hard but should be harder than Ren-14. When the area around this
point feels distended or hard, it usually indicates stagnation of Qi aﬀecting not only
the Heart but often the Lungs and Stomach as well, and generally caused by
emotional problems. If the area around Ren-14 feels too soft and the hand sinks
easily this indicates a deficiency condition of the Heart. When palpating Ren-14, we
should also always palpate Ren-15 Jiuwei because, although it is not the Front
Collecting point of the Heart, it very much functions as one and palpation of this
point therefore has the same diagnostic significance as that of Ren-14.

     Ren-4 Guanyuan
   This point indicates Full or Empty conditions of the Small Intestine but in my
experience this is a secondary aspect of its palpation. I feel that the condition of the
Small Intestine is also reflected by palpation of other points such as ST-25 Tianshu,
ST-27 Daju, ST-28 Shuidao and ST-29 Guilai. By contrast, palpation of Ren-4
Guanyuan is important to show Full or Empty conditions of the Uterus and of the
Penetrating and Directing Vessels. If this point feels distended on palpation this
indicates stagnation of Qi in the Uterus, if it feels hard on palpation it indicates
retention of Dampness in the Uterus, and if it feels hard with a sensation of a mass
it indicates Blood stasis in the Uterus. If this point feels very soft and the hand sinks
easily, it indicates a condition of deficiency of the Uterus and of the Penetrating and
Directing Vessels (this finding is common in multiparous women).

     Ren-3 Zhongji
   This point readily reflects Full or Empty conditions of the Bladder on palpation.
However, palpation of this point also reflects the condition of the Liver channel,
especially in urinary conditions. For example, if this point feels distended on
palpation, it indicates stagnation of Qi, not only in the Bladder, but also in the Liver
channel, usually causing urinary problems; if this point feels hard on palpation it
indicates retention of Dampness in the Bladder or in the Liver channel, or both.

     GB-25 Jingmen
   This point reflects diseases of the Kidney organ; if it is tender on palpation, this
may indicate the presence of a kidney infection.

     Ren-17 Shanzhong
   This point indicates Full and Empty conditions of the Pericardium according to
the same general principles, depending on whether it feels hard or soft on
palpation. However, to determine conditions of the Heart and Pericardium,
palpation of Ren-14 Juque and Ren-15 Jiuwei is more important.

     Ren-5 Shimen
   This point reflects the condition of the Lower Burner and particularly Small
Intestine, Bladder, Uterus and Kidneys. Hardness here indicates a Full condition of
one of these organs, while a softness indicates a deficiency of one of these organs
but also of the Original Qi (Yuan Qi ).

     GB-24 Riyue
   This point indicates the state of the Gall-Bladder. A hardness at this point
indicates Dampness in the Gall-Bladder while a softness indicates Gall-Bladder Qi
deficiency.

     LIV-14 Qimen
   This point reflects the condition of the Liver. A hardness at this point and
tenderness on palpation indicate a Full condition of the Liver (Qi stagnation, Blood
stasis, Dampness). A softness on palpation indicates Liver-Blood deficiency.

     Back Transporting (Bei Shu ) Points
   The Back Transporting points are all located on the Bladder channel on the back
and may also be used diagnostically. The same principles that apply to Front
Collecting points apply to these points, that is, if they are tender on palpation this
indicates a Full condition of the relevant organ, whereas if palpation relieves a
particular pain it indicates an Empty condition of that organ. A particular
diagnostic significance of the palpation of these points is that they reflect
specifically a condition of the relevant Internal Organ as opposed to its channel. For
example, tenderness on BL-18 Ganshu may indicate a Full condition of the Liver.
   The Back Transporting points are listed in Box 51.21 .

          BOX 51.21         BACK TRANSPORTING POINTS
          • Lungs: BL-13 Feishu
          • Pericardium: BL-14 Jueyinshu
          • Heart: BL-15 Xinshu
            • Liver: BL-18 Ganshu
            • Gall-Bladder: BL-19 Danshu
            • Spleen: BL-20 Pishu
            • Stomach: BL-21 Weishu
            • Triple Burner: BL-22 Sanjiaoshu
            • Kidneys: BL-23 Shenshu
            • Large Intestine: BL-25 Dachangshu
            • Small Intestine: BL-27 Xiaochangshu
            • Bladder: BL-28 Pangguangshu

     Source (Yuan ) Points
   The diagnostic use of the Source points is described in Chapter 1 of the
‘Spiritual Axis', which says: ‘ If the 5 Yin organs are diseased, abnormal reactions
will appear at the 12 Source points. If we know the correspondence of Source points
to the relevant Yin organ, we can diagnose when a Yin organ is diseased. ' 7 This
statement clearly indicates that the Source points have a relation-ship with the
Original Qi and that changes on the skin over the Source points or tenderness on
palpation indicate abnormalities in the relevant Yin organ. It should be noted that
Chapter 1 of the ‘Spiritual Axis' lists Source points only for the Yin organs (Box
51.22 ).

             BOX 51.22         SOURCE POINTS FOR THE YIN
       ORGANS
            • Lungs: LU-9 Taiyuan
            • Heart: PE-7 Daling
            • Spleen: SP-3 Taibai
            • Liver: LIV-3 Taichong
            • Kidneys: KI-3 Taixi
   This makes a total of 10 points (each point being bilateral); the other two source
points listed in that chapter are Ren-15 Jiuwei for Fat tissues, and Ren-6 Qihai for
the Membranes.

    INTRODUCTION
   Besides palpating specific points with a particular diagnostic significance (as
described in the previous chapter), palpation diagnosis must include also
palpation of the channels. Before discussing the palpation of channels proper, we
must discuss the energetic significance of the secondary channels, and in
particular the Connecting (Luo ) channels and the Muscle (Jing Jin ) channels:
these are the two secondary channels that are mostly involved in palpation. The
other secondary channels, the Divergent (Jing Bie ) channels, are not involved in
palpation because they lie at a deep level, deeper than the Main channels.
     CONNECTING CHANNELS
   The Connecting channels are called Luo Mai : Luo implies the meaning of
‘network'. (The Main channels are called Jing Mai , and Jing implies the meaning
of ‘line', ‘route', ‘way'.) Chapter 17 of the ‘Spiritual Axis' confirms that the
Connecting channels are ‘horizontal' or ‘crosswise': ‘ The Main channels are in
the Interior, their branches are horizontal [or crosswise] forming the Luo
channels '. 1
   The Connecting channels are more superficial than the Main channels and
they run in all directions, horizontally rather than vertically. In particular, they
fill the space between skin and muscles (i.e. the Cou Li space). The components of
each channel system correspond to diﬀerent energetic layers pertaining to that
channel. For example, if we take the Lung channel, the most superficial part of it
is the skin overlying the channel pathway; below that, there is the space between
skin and muscles or Li space, that is, the space between the skin and muscles
where the Superficial Connecting channels course; below that, the Connecting
channel proper fills the space between the muscles and sinews: below that, there
is the Lung Main channel and below that, the Lung Deep Connecting channel
(Fig. 52.1 ). It is important to visualize the Connecting channels not as lines but
as spaces filled by channels.

                      - - - - ·Sup~ rfk:ial Connecting channel
                      - - - - Connectingi channel

                               Deep Connecting channel
      FIG. 52.1   Energetic layers of a channel (Lung)
   Thus, the Connecting channels occupy the space between the Main channels
and the skin; however, within this space, there are also degrees of depth. On the
superficial layers just below the skin there are smaller Connecting channels
called Minute and Superficial Connecting channels.
   The main branches of the Connecting channels are called Bie , that is,
‘divergent' (same word as that used for Divergent channels). The Minute
Connecting channels are called Sun , whereas the Superficial ones are called are
called Fu .
   Chapter 17 of the ‘Spiritual Axis' says: ‘ The Main channels are in the
Interior, their branches are horizontal [or crosswise] forming the Luo channels:
branching out from these are the Minute Luo '. 2 Chapter 10 of the same book
says: ‘ The more superficial branches of the channels which can be seen are the
Luo channels '. 3 Chapter 58 of the ‘Simple Questions' states: ‘The Minute Luo
[Sun Luo] communicate with the 365 points '. 4
   However, the Connecting channels have also a deeper layer beyond the Main
channels: these can be called the Deep Connecting channels and they are
connected to the blood vessels and Blood in general.
   The 12 Main channels are situated between the Yang and Yin Connecting
channels. It is through the Yin and Yang Connecting channels that Nutritive and
Defensive Qi and Qi and Blood of the main channels spread in all directions,
permeate and irrigate the Internal Organs. It is also through the Connecting
channels that the essence of the Internal Organs is transported to the Main
channels and, through them, to the whole body.
   The Connecting channels cannot penetrate the big joints of the body (as do
the Main channels) and they are therefore restricted to the spaces in between the
deep pathway of the Main channels and the surface of the body. The Connecting
channels also fill the spaces and ‘cavities' of the body, which are all part of the
Triple Burner. This means that most of the stagnation in the body actually occurs
in the Connecting channels because they are ‘constricted' in these spaces (as they
cannot course through the large joints) and because they form like a net which
easily ‘catches' pathogenic factors or in which Qi or Blood, or both, become
stagnant. Chapter 10 of the ‘Spiritual Axis' says:
        The Luo channels cannot course through the large joints; in order to
    [enter and] exit they must move by alternate routes. They then enter and
    come together again under the skin and therefore they can be seen from the
    outside. To needle the Luo channel one must needle above the accumulation
    where Blood is concentrated. Even if there is no blood accumulation, one
    must prick to cause bleeding quickly to drain the pathogenic factors out: if
    this is not done, Bi syndrome may develop. 5

     Palpation
   Palpation of the limbs involves essentially palpation of the Connecting
channels and especially the Superficial Connecting channels and the Connecting
channels proper. Generally speaking, the more distal the point, the more it
reflects the state of the Connecting channels, whereas the more proximal the
point, the more it reflects the state of the Main channels. For example, palpation
of the forearm from LU-10 to LU-3 and slightly beyond reflects the state of the
Lung Connecting channel portion; palpation in the area of LU-2 and LU-1
reflects more the state of the Lung Main channel (and the organ itself).
   Palpation should include the following techniques.

     Touching
   Touching the skin reveals its temperature and moisture and reflects the state
of the Superficial Connecting channels. A hot sensation indicates Heat of the
Superficial Connecting channel; a cold sensation indicates Cold of that particular
channel. Dryness of the skin indicates lack of Body Fluids in the Superficial
Connecting channels (related to Lungs and Spleen), whereas excessive sweating
indicates a weak state of the space between skin and muscles (related to Lung-Qi
deficiency).

     Stroking
   Stroking the skin reveals the texture and firmness of the skin and flesh and
reflects the state of the Connecting channels. A flaccid feel indicates a weakness
of the Connecting channel of the particular channel palpated; a hardness
indicates stagnation there.

     Pressing
   Pressing the muscles reveals the firmness of the muscles and sinews and
possible lumps or masses. Stiﬀness and hardness of the layers below the flesh of
the limb indicate a Full condition of the Connecting channels (stagnation of Qi or
Blood, or both). Flaccidity indicates a condition of Emptiness of the Connecting
channel.

     MUSCLE CHANNELS
   The Muscle channels are called Jing Jin , which could be translated as
‘channel-like muscles' or ‘muscles of the channels'. They are discussed in
Chapter 13 of the ‘Spiritual Axis'.

     Characteristics
   The Muscle channels have the following characteristics:

           • they are on the surface of the body
           • they do not connect with the Internal Organs
           • they all originate at the extremities
           • they broadly follow the course of the Main channel (with
      exceptions, e.g. the Bladder Muscle channel)
           • they follow the contours of the major muscles overlying the
      Main channels.

     Functions

           • They protect the body from trauma.
           • They sustain the body in its erect position.
           • They maintain the integrity of the body by connecting the
      ‘100 bones'.
           • They govern the movement of joints.
           • They allow movement of the body.
           • They contribute to the integration of the surface of the body
      with the Interior.
          • They contribute to the integration and connection within the
      Yang and within the Yin channels (i.e. the connections between
      Greater-Yang, Bright-Yang and Lesser-Yang channels and those
      between Greater-Yin, Lesser-Yin and Terminal-Yin channels).

     Palpation
   Palpation of the Muscle channels is done relatively firmly and it reveals the
consistency of the muscles. A hard and stiﬀ feel on palpation indicates either
stagnation of Qi or Cold in the Muscle channels, whereas a flaccid feel indicates
a deficiency of Qi or Blood, or both, in the Muscle channels.
   The pathology of Muscle channels is essentially related only to invasion of
external pathogenic factors or trauma.

     PALPATION OF THE CHANNELS IN
PAINFUL OBSTRUCTION SYNDROME (BI )
   Palpation of points along the channel is essential in the treatment of Painful
Obstruction Syndrome; this consists in the palpation not only of actual
acupuncture points but also of Ah Shi points. Therefore, in order to find the Ah
Shi points, the whole channel needs to be palpated.
   The choice of points in the treatment of Painful Obstruction Syndrome is
based primarily on one or more distal points of the aﬀected channel (which are
usually needled with reducing or even method) and on several local points
according to tenderness on palpation. Palpating the Ah Shi points serves two
purposes: in diagnosis, it allows us to identify the aﬀected channel precisely; in
treatment, it allows us to treat the reactive points (because their tenderness
indicates the points of local stagnation).
   Identifying the aﬀected channel through palpation is absolutely essential for
the choice of both distal and local points. For example, in shoulder problems, one
must clearly identify the channel involved, which may be Small Intestine, Triple
Burner, Large Intestine or Lung channel.

     PALPATION OF CHANNELS
   Each channel has specific areas that have a particular diagnostic significance
on palpation. The following is a discussion of these areas for each channel.
   For each channel, two aspects of palpation are discussed, that is palpation of
a blood vessel overlying the channel and palpation of the skin overlying the
channel. For palpation of the skin, three aspects are discussed, that is,
temperature, texture and tenderness.

     Lung Channel
   Apart from the palpation of points along the channels, the palpation of the
Front position of the radial artery on the right side itself is a form of palpation of
the Lung channel.

     Palpation of blood vessel
   The axillary artery can be palpated along the channel in the region extending
from LU-1 Zhongfu to LU-4 Xiabai. If this feels superficial on palpation, it
indicates an external invasion of Wind in the Lung-Defensive-Qi portion; if it
feels deep this indicates an internal Lung problem. If it is rapid, this indicates
Lung-Heat; if it is slow, this denotes Damp-Phlegm or Cold-Phlegm in the
Lungs. If the artery pulsation feels empty this indicates Lung-Qi deficiency; if it
feels full, this denotes a Full condition of the Lung such as Phlegm in the Lungs.

     Palpation of skin

     Temperature
   Besides feeling the pulsation of the axillary artery, one should palpate the
skin overlying the Lung channel, again in the area extending from LU-1 Zhongfu
to LU-4 Xiabai. If the skin feels hot, this indicates Lung-Heat, whereas if it feels
cold, this indicates Cold-Phlegm in the Lungs.

     Texture
   If the skin feels flaccid, it denotes Lung-Qi deficiency. If it feels rough and
stiﬀ, this indicates a Full condition of the Lungs.

     Tenderness
   Tenderness on palpation indicates stagnation of Qi and Blood in the Lung
channel. If the tenderness is elicited with a light pressure this indicates
stagnation in the superficial layers at the level of the Lung Connecting channel
energetic layer; if it is elicited with a deep pressure this indicates stagnation at
the deep energetic layers of the channel, that is, the sinew and bone energetic
layers.
   Box 52.1 summarizes the findings on palpation of the Lung channel.

          • Rough and stiﬀ: Full condition of the Lungs
          Tenderness
          • Tenderness with a light pressure: stagnation in the
      superficial layers of the Lung Connecting channel
          • Tenderness with a deep pressure: stagnation at the deep
      energetic layers of the channel, i.e. sinew and bone energetic layers

     Large Intestine Channel
   The diagnostic area for palpation on the Large Intestine channel is the area
from LI-4 Hegu to LI-5 Yangxi and especially the la er where the radial artery
can be felt.

     Palpation of blood vessel
   If the pulsation in the area of LI-5 Yangxi is superficial and large, this
indicates conditions such as facial paralysis, tooth abscess or external Wind-
Heat; if it is deep it may indicate an intestinal pathology such as abdominal pain,
constipation or diarrhoea. If it is rapid this denotes a Heat condition of the Large
Intestine and if it is slow a Cold condition. If the pulsation feels empty this
denotes an Empty condition of the Large Intestine, and if it feels full a Full
condition with stagnation and abdominal pain.

     Palpation of skin

     Temperature
   If the skin in the area of LI-4 Hegu and LI-5 Yangxi feels hot, this indicates a
Heat condition of the channel often causing a tooth abscess or tonsillitis. If it
feels cold, this denotes a Cold condition.

     Texture
   If the skin in the same area feels flaccid, this indicates an Empty condition of
the Large Intestine with symptoms such as chronic diarrhoea. If the skin feels
rough and hard it denotes a Full condition of the Large Intestine with symptoms
such as Damp-Heat diarrhoea.
    Tenderness
   If the area between LI-4 Hegu and LI-5 Yangxi is tender on a light palpation,
this indicates a stagnation in the Superficial Connecting channels (with
symptoms such as facial tingling). If it is tender on deep pressure, it indicates a
stagnation in the Connectingchannels proper, and possibly also the Deep
Connecting channels, with symptoms such as chronic tendinitis of the shoulder
or elbow with long-standing stagnation. If there is a spontaneous tenderness that
is alleviated by palpation, this indicates an Empty condition of the channel,
whereas if the tenderness is aggravated by palpation it denotes a Full condition
of the channel.

      channel

    Stomach Channel
Palpation of blood vessel
   The two areas with diagnostic significance are ST-42 Chongyang and ST-9
Renying.

     ST-42 Chongyang
   The dorsal artery can be felt at this point. If the pulsation feels superficial, this
indicates problems of the Stomach channel such as headache or sore throat; if it
feels deep, it denotes problems of the Stomach organ with symptoms such as
epigastric pain. If the pulsation is rapid, this indicates Heat in the Stomach
channel with symptoms such as thirst and problems of the teeth or gums from
Heat; if it feels slow, it indicates Cold in the Stomach channel. If the pulsation
feels empty, this denotes an Empty condition of the Stomach with symptoms
such as a dull epigastric pain; if it is full, it indicates a Full condition of the
Stomach with symptoms such as epigastric pain from stagnation.

     ST-9 Renying
   The carotid artery can be felt at this point. This point is a Window of Heaven
point regulating the flow of Qi to and from the head. If the carotid pulse feels
full and rapid, this indicates a Full condition with excess of Yang in the head; if it
feels empty, this indicates an Empty condition with a deficiency of Qi or Blood,
or both, in the head.

     Palpation of skin
   The area around ST-42 Chongyang is palpated.

     Temperature
   If the skin feels hot on palpation this indicates a condition of Heat of the
Stomach channel, which may be causing gum or breast problems (in women); if
the skin feels cold, it indicates a Cold condition of the Stomach with symptoms
such as dull epigastric pain.

     Texture
   If the skin in the area of ST-42 Chongyang feels flaccid, this indicates an
Empty condition of the Stomach with symptoms such as dull epigastric pain, if it
feels rough and hard, it denotes a Full condition of the Stomach, which may be
causing a sharp epigastric pain or a breast pathology (in women).

     Tenderness
   If the area is tender on light palpation, this indicates a stagnation in the
Superficial Connecting channels with symptoms such as facial paralysis; if it is
tenderon deep pressure it indicates stagnation of Qi or Blood, or both, in the

stagnation in the Superficial Connecting channels (with symptoms such as face
and ear tingling), while if tender on deep pressure it indicates a stagnation in the
Connecting channels proper, and possibly also the Deep Connecting channels,
with symptoms such as chronic hip or knee pain from long-standing stagnation.
If there is a spontaneous tenderness that is alleviated by palpation, this indicates
an Empty condition of the channel, whereas if aggravated by palpation it
denotes a Full condition of the channel.
   Box 52.11 summarizes findings on palpation of the Gall-Bladder channel.
          B O X 5 2 . 11   GALL-BLADDER CHANNEL
      PALPATION
        Palpation of blood vessel: area around GB-2 Tinghui
         • Superficial and large: external Wind
         • Deep: hypochondrial pain
         • Rapid: Heat (e.g. earache, red eyes)
         • Slow: Cold (e.g. headache, watery eyes)
         • Empty: Empty condition (e.g. vaginal discharge)
         • Full: Full condition (e.g. earache)
          Palpation of skin
         Temperature
         • Hot: Heat (e.g. ear infection)
         • Cold: Cold (e.g. cold/weak legs)
         Texture
         • Flaccid: Empty condition (e.g. backache, weak legs)
         • Rough and hard: Full condition (e.g. hypochondrial pain)
         Tenderness
         • Tenderness on light palpation: stagnation in the Superficial
      Connecting channel
         • Tenderness on deep pressure: stagnation in the Connecting
      channel proper and Deep Connecting channel
         • Spontaneous tenderness alleviated by pressure: Empty
      condition of the channel
         • Spontaneous tenderness aggravated by pressure: Full
      condition of the channel

    Liver Channel
   The diagnostic area for palpation on the Liver channel is the area around
LIV-3 Taichong (where the dorsal metatarsal artery can be felt), LIV-9 Yinbao
and LIV-10 Wuli (where the femoral artery can be felt).

    Palpation of blood vessel
   If the pulsation in the area of LIV-3 Taichong, LIV-9 Yinbao and LIV-10 Wuli
is superficial and large, this indicates conditions such as headache and painful
eyes; if it is deep it may indicate a Liver pathology such as Liver-Qi stagnation,
with symptoms of abdominal pain. If it is rapid, this denotes a Heat condition of
the Liver, with symptoms such as headache, red eyes and epistaxis; if slow it
denotes a Cold condition, with symptoms such as headache or watering eyes. If
the pulsation feels empty, this denotes an Empty condition of the Liver such as
Liver-Blood deficiency, with symptoms such as blurred vision and scanty
periods; if it feels full, it denotes a Full condition such as Liver-Qi stagnation,
with symptoms such as hypogastric distension and urinary problems.

    Palpation of skin

    Temperature
   If the skin in the area of LIV-3 Taichong, LIV-9 Yinbao and LIV-10 Wuli feels
hot, this indicates a Heat conditionof channel, which may cause erysipelas or
inflammation of the external genitalia; if it feels cold it denotes a Cold condition,
with symptoms such as cold hypogastrium and external genitalia.

    Texture
   If the skin in the same area feels flaccid, this indicates an Empty condition of
the Liver, with symptoms such as numbness and weakness of the legs; if it feels
rough and hard it denotes a Full condition of the Liver, with symptoms such as
hypochondrial pain.

    Tenderness
   If the area around LIV-3 Taichong, LIV-9 Yinbao and LIV-10 Wuli is tender
on light palpation, this indicates a stagnation in the Superficial Connecting
channels (with symptoms such as genital itching), whereas if tender on deep
pressure, it indicates a stagnation in the Connecting channels proper, and
possibly also Deep Connecting channels, with symptoms such as hypogastric
pain and urinary symptoms. If there is a spontaneous tenderness that is
alleviated by palpation, this indicates an Empty condition of the channel; if the
tenderness is aggravated by palpation it denotes a Full condition of the channel.
   Box 52.12 summarizes the findings on palpations of the Liver channel.

          BOX 52.12        LIVER CHANNEL PATHOLOGY
         Palpation of blood vessel: from LIV-3 Taichong to
      LIV-10 Wuli
         • Superficial and large: pain in head and eyes
         • Deep: Liver-Qi stagnation
         • Rapid: Liver-Heat (e.g. headache, red eyes)
         • Slow: headache with watery eyes
         • Empty: Liver-Blood deficiency
         • Full: Liver-Qi stagnation (e.g. urinary problems)
          Palpation of skin
         Temperature
         • Hot: Heat in channel (e.g. inflammation of genitalia)
         • Cold: Cold in channel (e.g. cold genitalia)
         Texture
     • Flaccid: Empty condition (e.g. numb/weak legs)
     • Rough and hard: Full condition (e.g. hypochondrial pain)
     Tenderness
     • Tenderness on light palpation: stagnation in the Superficial
  Connecting channel
     • Tenderness on deep pressure: stagnation in the Connecting
  channel proper and Deep Connecting channel
     • Spontaneous tenderness alleviated by pressure: Empty
  condition of the channel
     • Spontaneous tenderness aggravated by pressure: Full
  condition of the channel
