    INTRODUCTION
   This part deals with the diagnostic method based on asking. This is the
central art of diagnosis not only because we need to elicit information from the
patient but also because the way the patient talks during the interrogation is in
itself a very important diagnostic sign reflecting the underlying physical,
emotional and mental condition of the patient. Moreover, it is through the
interrogation process that we interact with the patient; therefore, the skill, tact
and compassion with which we conduct the interrogation has a profound
influence on the therapeutic results themselves. Thus, the process of
‘interrogation' of the patient is far more than a set of rules about which questions
to ask and how to ask them: it is the heart of the therapeutic encounter between
the practitioner and the patient; it is the crucible in which the healing takes place.
   Diagnosis by interrogation is one of the four pillars of the Chinese diagnostic
methods and one that should always be carried out. If the patient is unconscious
or is a baby or a small child, the questions should be put to a close relative.
   The discussion of the interrogation procedure will be articulated under the
following headings (Chapter 28 ):

          • nature of diagnosis by interrogation
          • nature of ‘symptoms' in Chinese medicine
          • the art of interrogation: asking the right questions
          • terminology problems in interrogation
          • patients' expressions
          • pitfalls to avoid in interrogation

          • procedure for interrogation
          • time scale of symptoms
          • integration of interrogation with observation
          • identification of pa erns and interrogation
          • tongue and pulse diagnosis: integration with interrogation
          • the 10 traditional questions
          • the 16 questions.

     NATURE OF DIAGNOSIS BY INTERROGATION
   We can distinguish two aspects to the interrogation: a general one and a specific one.
   In a general sense, the interrogation is the talk between doctor and patient to find out
how the presenting problem arose, the living and working conditions of the patient and the
emotional and family environment. The aim of an investigation of these aspects of the
patient's life is ultimately to find the cause or causes of the disease rather than to identify the
pa ern; finding the causes of the disease is important in order for the patient and doctor to
work together to try to eliminate or minimize such causes (Fig. 28.1 ). How to find the cause
of disease is discussed in Chapter 48 .

      FIG. 28.1   Interrogation
   In a specific sense, the interrogation aims at identifying the prevailing pa ern of
disharmony in the light of whatever method of pa ern identification is applicable, for
example according to the Internal Organs, according to the channels, according to the Four
Levels, etc.
   Box 28.1 summarizes these aspects of interrogation.

          BOX 28.1        THE TWO ASPECTS OF
      INTERROGATION
          • General : asking about lifestyle, work, emotions, diet, etc. to determine
      the cause of disease
          • Specific : asking about clinical manifestations to determine the pa erns
      of disharmony
   It is important not to blur the distinction between these two aspects of interrogation;
enquiring about the patient's family situation, environment, work and relationships gives us
an idea of the cause , not the pa ern of the disharmony. Knowing that a patient is a business
man with a heavy work burden, an antagonistic relationship with his employers or marital
problems does not tell us which might be the prevailing pa ern of disharmony but simply
that stress and emotional tension are likely to be the cause of the disharmony; this
knowledge is essential when working with the patient to try to eliminate or minimize the
causes of disease.
   During the course of the interrogation, we ask about many symptoms that may be
apparently unrelated to the presenting problem; we do this in order to find the pa ern (or
pa erns) of disharmony that underlie the presenting problem. For example, a patient may
present with chronic backache which we suspect may be due to a Kidney-Yang deficiency
with Dampness. By asking about bowels and urination, for example, we may find that there
are other symptoms of Dampness in one of these two systems and this would confirm the
original diagnosis of Dampness as the cause of the backache.
   Not all symptoms and signs add up to one pa ern of disharmony: indeed, most patients
will suﬀer from at least two related pa erns of disharmony. To use the above example again,
in this case enquiring about urination and defecation may confirm to us that this patient
does indeed suﬀer from Kidney-Yang deficiency with Dampness. These two pa erns are
related because deficient Kidney-Yang fails to warm, move, transform and excrete fluids
properly, which may accumulate in the form of Dampness. Moreover, an enquiry about
other areas of questioning beyond the lower back and urination is always important because
it may reveal other pa erns of disharmony, which may be unrelated to the pa erns of
disharmony causing a patient's presenting symptoms. To continue the above example, it
may be that an enquiry about bowels, urination and other systems reveals a condition of Qi
stagnation, which may be unrelated to the presenting problem.
   Diagnosis by interrogation is intimately related to pa ern identification: one cannot be
carried out without a thorough knowledge of the other. Without a knowledge of pa ern
identification, interrogation would be a meaningless and aimless process of asking questions
without a clear idea of what to make of the answers and how to use these to arrive at a
diagnosis. On the other hand, a knowledge of pa ern identification without a thorough
understanding of diagnostic methods would be useless as we would lack the skills and tools
to arrive at a pa ern identification. Thus, a knowledge of pa ern identification is the
essential prerequisite to form a diagnosis, but skill in the diagnostic art is the means by
which a diagnosis is made.

          Remember : the questions asked during the interrogation must always be
      guided by our a empt to confirm or exclude a pa ern of disharmony.
     NATURE OF "SYMPTOMS" IN CHINESE
MEDICINE
   Diagnosis by interrogation is based on the fundamental principle that symptoms and
signs reflect the condition of the Internal Organs and channels. The concept of symptoms
and signs in Chinese medicine is broader than in Western medicine. Whilst Western
medicine mostly takes into account symptoms and signs as subjective and objective
manifestations of a disease, Chinese medicine takes into account many diﬀerent
manifestations as parts of a whole picture, many of them not related to an actual disease
process. Chinese medicine uses not only "symptoms and signs" as such but many other
manifestations to form a picture of the disharmony present in a particular person. Thus, the
interrogation extends well beyond the "symptoms and signs" pertaining to the presenting
complaint. For example, if a patient presents with epigastric pain as the chief complaint, a
Western doctor would enquire about the symptoms strictly relevant to that complaint (e.g. Is
the pain be er or worse after eating? Does the pain come immediately after eating or two
hours later? Is there regurgitation of food? etc.). A Chinese doctor would ask similar
questions but many others too, such as "Are you thirsty?", "Do you have a bi er taste in
your mouth?", "Do you feel tired?", etc. Many of the so-called symptoms and signs of
Chinese medicine would not be considered as such in Western medicine. For example,
absence of thirst (which confirms a Cold condition), inability to make decisions (which
points to a deficiency of the Gall-Bladder), dislike of speaking (which indicates a deficiency
of the Lungs), propensity to outbursts of anger (which confirms the rising of Liver-Yang or
Liver-Fire), desire to lie down (which indicates a weakness of the Spleen), dull appearance of
the eyes (which points to a disturbance of the Mind and emotional problems), deep midline
crack on the tongue (which is a sign of propensity to deep emotional problems), and so on.
Whenever I refer to "symptoms and signs" (which I shall also call "clinical manifestations"),
it will be in the above context.

     Tongue And Pulse
   It is important to stress that the tongue and the pulse are signs that may determine a
diagnosis, even in the complete absence of symptoms. In other words, a Slippery pulse is as
much a sign of Phlegm as expectoration of sputum, and a persistently Weak pulse on the
Kidney position is as much as sign of Kidney deficiency as other symptoms.
   For example, a young woman may have a persistently Weak Kidney pulse without any
symptoms of Kidney deficiency: the Weak Kidney pulse is as much a symptom of Kidney
deficiency as backache, dizziness and tinnitus and we can therefore safely assume that this
patient suﬀers from a Kidney deficiency. However, a particular pulse position may become
Weak only temporarily through various lifestyle influences and we can reach a diagnostic
conclusion only when the pulse has a particular quality consistently over a period of a few
weeks or more.
   The same applies to tongue signs which may appear in the absence of symptoms. For
example, a Swollen tongue with a sticky coating indicates Phlegm even in the absence of
other symptoms of Phlegm. In other words, such a tongue is as much a sign of Phlegm as
expectoration of sputum.

          Remember : the tongue or pulse alone are enough to confirm the presence
      of a pa ern of disharmony.
  THE ART OF INTERROGATION: ASKING THE
RIGHT QUESTIONS
     Diagnosis by interrogation is of course extremely important as, in the process of
identifying a pa ern, not all the information is given by the patient. Indeed, even if it were,
it would still need to be organized in order to identify the pa ern or pa erns. Sometimes the
absence of a certain symptom or sign is diagnostically determinant and patients, of course,
would not report symptoms they do not experience. For example, in distinguishing between
a Heat and a Cold pa ern, it is necessary to establish whether a person is thirsty or not, and
the absence of thirst would point to a Cold pa ern. The patient would obviously not
volunteer the information of "not being thirsty".
     The art of diagnosis by interrogation consists in asking relevant questions in relation to a
specific patient and a specific condition. A certain pa ern may be diagnosed only when the
"right" questions are asked; if we are not aware of a specific pa ern and do not ask relevant
questions, we will never arrive at a correct diagnosis. For example, if we do not know the
existence of the pa ern of "rebellious Qi of the Penetrating Vessel," we will obviously not
ask the questions which might lead us to diagnose such a pa ern (see below).
     The interrogation should not consist of blindly following the traditional list of questions;
it should be conducted following a "lead" with our asking a series of questions to confirm or
exclude a pa ern, or pa erns, of disharmony that comes to our mind during the exchange of
question and response. Therefore, when we ask the patient a question we should always ask
ourselves why we are asking that question. During an interrogation, we should be constantly
shifting or reviewing our hypotheses about the possible pa erns of disharmony, trying to
confirm or exclude certain pa erns by asking the right questions.
     For example, a patient may present with chronic headaches and, even at this very early
stage, we are already making a hypothesis about the possible pa ern of disharmony on the
basis of our experience and our knowledge, that is, we are thinking of Liver-Yang rising
because we know it is by far the most common cause of chronic headaches. We therefore ask
questions about the character and location of the pain: if the patient says that the pain is
throbbing and is located on the temples, even these few details would almost certainly
confirm the diagnosis of Liver-Yang rising. However, we should never stop there and reach
premature conclusions. Instead we should ask further questions to confirm or exclude the
existence of other pa erns which also cause headaches. For example, Phlegm is another
common cause of chronic headaches and we therefore ask this patient first about other
characteristics of the headaches which may confirm Phlegm, and also about possible
symptoms of Phlegm in other parts of the body: "Does the patient experience a feeling of
muzziness in the head?" "Is the headache sometimes dull and accompanied by a feeling of
heaviness?" If the answer to these questions is aﬃrmative, we conclude that Phlegm might
be a further cause of the headaches. We then ask other questions related to Phlegm in other
parts of the body; in this particular case, we might ask whether the patient occasionally
expectorates sputum or sometimes experiences a feeling of oppression in the chest. (Fig. 28.2
).

      FIG. 28.2   Asking the right questions
   Another example of the importance of asking the right questions to confirm or exclude
our hypothesis about the pa ern or pa erns of disharmony is rebellious Qi of the
Penetrating Vessel. Rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel may cause a wide range of
symptoms aﬀecting the whole torso. These may include: lower abdominal fullness and pain,
painful periods, umbilical fullness and pain, epigastric fullness and pain, a feeling of energy
rising in the abdomen, a feeling of tightness of the chest, slight breathlessness, palpitations, a
feeling of lump in the throat, a feeling of heat in the face, and anxiety (of course not all these
symptoms need to be present). It may well be that the patient reports only the symptoms of
painful periods and a feeling of lump in the throat: if we are not familiar with the pa ern of
rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel we may not ask the right questions to uncover other
related symptoms and we may therefore a ribute painful periods to Cold in the Uterus (for
example) and the feeling of a lump in the throat to stagnation of Liver-Qi. Even should we
uncover other symptoms mentioned above, if we are not familiar with the pa ern of
rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel we may wrongly a ribute the above symptoms to a
confusing number of pa erns involving many organs instead of seeing that they are
connected with the pa ern of rebellious Qi of the Penetrating Vessel.

     TERMINOLOGY PROBLEMS IN INTERROGATION
   A potential problem for practitioners in the West is that the interrogation and the various
expressions used to express symptoms are derived from Chinese experiences and culture
and a Western patient would not necessarily use the same expressions. This is a problem,
however, that can be overcome with experience. After some years of practice, we can learn
to translate the Chinese way of expressing symptoms and find correlations more common to
Western patients. For example, whereas a Chinese man might spontaneously say that he has
a "distending pain", an English-speaking Western patient might say that he feels "bloated"
or "bursting". The words are diﬀerent, but the symptom they describe is the same. With
practice and acute observation we gradually build up a "vocabulary" of symptoms as
described by Western patients. For example, I have come to interpret the peculiar English
expression "a feeling of bu erflies in the stomach" as a symptom of rebellious Qi in the
Penetrating Vessel.
   The translation from Chinese of the terms related to certain symptoms may also present
some problems. The traditional terms are rich with meaning and sometimes very poetic and
are more or less impossible to translate properly because Western language cannot convey
all the nuances intrinsic in a Chinese character. For example, I translate the word Men as a
"feeling of oppression"; an analysis of the Chinese character, however, which portrays a
heart squashed by a door, conveys the feeling of oppression in a rich, metaphorical way.
What cannot be adequately translated is the cultural use of this term in China often to imply
that the person is rather "depressed" (as we intend this term in the West) from emotional
problems. As Chinese patients seldom admit openly to being "depressed", they will often
say they experience a feeling of Men in the chest.
   Another example is the term Xin Fan , which I translate as "mental restlessness": the
Chinese characters contain the radical for "heart", indicating an emotional cause of this
feeling, and the radical for "fire", indicating the heating eﬀect of emotional stress on the
Internal Organ; the translation cannot possibly do justice to the Chinese term and convey its
rich inner meaning.
   Yet another interesting example is the use of the word Ku to describe certain symptoms:
Ku means "bi er" and is sometimes used to indicate a pain's severity. However, the word
Ku in China has also a definite emotional connotation implying that the person has had a
"bi er" life and bi er life experiences.
   We should not, however, overemphasize the terminology problems due to cultural
diﬀerences between China and the West. Quite frequently, Western patients report
symptoms exactly as they are in Chinese books. For example, a patient recently told me
quite spontaneously "I am often thirsty but I do not feel like drinking".

     PATIENTS' EXPRESSIONS
   It is only after the patient has finished relating the main problems that we can start
asking questions systematically on the basis of the "10 questions" (see below), but always
following the lead given by what the patient has told us. Often patients have a good insight
as to the main problem in their life; often this is the first "problem" they report. For example,
when asked about what the main problem was, a 48-year-old man said that he was at a cross-
roads in his life , that he felt dissatisfied with his work and that he was searching for something
more meaningful in his life . This is a good example of how a patient spontaneously volunteers
information about existential doubts which are obviously at the root of the physical
problems. Of course, it is not always like this: very many patients cannot see or do not want
to see the existential and spiritual problems in their life and present with a long list of
physical symptoms which hide the true root of their existential dis-ease .
   At the beginning of the interrogation, it is important to let patients speak freely and to
make a note of the actual expressions they use; these are usually quite suggestive and
indicative of the patient's problem and sometimes also of the aetiology. For example, if a
patient describes feeling "impotent" about a certain situation, it conveys the idea that the
patient feels frustrated (and, in the case of a man, it may also indicate sexual impotence). It is
particularly important to make a note of the actual expression used by a patient especially
when this is repeated in the course of the interrogation. For example, a patient may use the
expression "trapped" two or three times, clearly indicating that emotional frustration may
be at the root of the problem.
   In some cases patients refer to a particular part of the body several times in the course of
the interrogation and this gives a strong indication of the possible pa ern involved. For
example, a patient suﬀering from chronic mental-emotional problems may refer to the
"throat" three or four times during the course of the interrogation, saying things such as, "I
feel a lump in the throat when I'm upset", "My throat often feels dry", or "I feel my heart in
my throat": this may suggest a condition of Qi stagnation in the Liver or Lungs.
   The practice of Chinese medicine in the West presents us with new challenges which
Chinese practitioners do not have in China. Western patients often seek treatment in search
of an existential and spiritual balance, which is not the case in China. We therefore need to
adapt our diagnosis and treatment to the needs of Western patients. For example, a woman
said that she sought treatment because she wanted "more integration, rhythm and
earthedness in her life". We therefore need to develop a new knowledge of pa erns and
diagnosis which allows us to interpret the needs of our patients as they report them. In this
particular example, I interpreted this patient's lack of "earthedness" as being due to a severe
Kidney deficiency which made her feel "without root" (it would have been a mistake to
interpret her word "earthedness" in a literal sense as necessarily pointing to a deficiency in
the Earth element).

    PITFALLS TO AVOID IN INTERROGATION
   The specific interrogation (as defined above), based on questions that concern the
patient's clinical manifestations, is aimed at finding the pa ern of disharmony; the general
interrogation (about the patient's lifestyle, family situation, emotional environment, living
conditions, etc.) is aimed at finding the cause of disease. It would be wrong to confuse the
two and to deduce the pa ern of disharmony from the enquiry about the patient's lifestyle,
work and family life. I have noticed this occurring in practice many times when a student or
practitioner brings a patient to me for a second opinion: I frequently hear comments such as
"Andrew is under a lot of stress at work and he therefore suﬀers from Liver-Qi stagnation".
This is an example of how a practitioner may confuse the general enquiry about the patient's
life to find the cause of the disease with the specific enquiry about clinical manifestations to
find the pa ern of disharmony. In other words, to go back to the above example, it would be
totally wrong to assume that Andrew suﬀers from Liver-Qi stagnation on the basis of an
enquiry about his lifestyle, work, etc.: such a diagnosis can be made only on the basis of a
specific enquiry about his clinical manifestations. Patients might well have a lot of stress in
their life, but this does not necessarily cause Liver-Qi stagnation as emotional strain may
cause many other pa erns.
   Another possible pitfall is to make a diagnosis of a pa ern of disharmony on the basis of
vague and woolly concepts deduced from observation of the patient's lifestyle - for example,
"Be y seems to be a very "woody" person, so I thought there was Liver-Qi stagnation". Of
course, a diagnosis of a person's prevailing Element on the basis of the body shape,
mannerism, gait and voice is important (see Chapter 1 ), but this does not always coincide
with the prevailing pa ern; in other words, a Wood-type person will not necessarily suﬀer
from a Liver pa ern of disharmony.
   A word of caution about the conducting of the interrogation is called for. As mentioned
above, the interrogation is conducted with close reference to pa ern identification and the
questions are aimed at confirming or excluding the existence of a certain pa ern of
disharmony in the patient. The diagnostic process starts with observation skills as soon as a
patient walks in; for example, if a woman patient looks pale, talks with a low voice, and
complains of tiredness and poor appetite, we immediately think of Spleen-Qi deficiency as a
possible pa ern, and thus further questions aim to confirm or disprove the existence of this
pa ern. In Chinese medicine, however, it is easy to conduct the interrogation in a way that
might influence the patient and elicit the symptoms that will force the clinical manifestations
into a preconceived pa ern; this is a real danger of Chinese diagnosis. The only way to
eliminate this danger is to keep an open mind; this is extremely important. Going back to the
above example, we must at all times be prepared to contemplate the real possibility that this
patient might not suﬀer from Spleen-Qi deficiency, or that Spleen-Qi deficiency might not be
the only or even the main pa ern or problem.
   Box 28.2 summarizes pitfalls in interrogation.

          BOX 28.2        PITFALLS IN INTERROGATION
         • Do not use information about the patient's lifestyle to deduce the pa ern
      of disharmony (you may deduce the cause of disease from it).
         • Do not rely exclusively on a patient's Elemental type to diagnose a
      pa ern of disharmony.
         • Remember to keep an open mind when diagnosing the pa erns of
      disharmony.

    PROCEDURE FOR INTERROGATION
   The interrogation generally follows on from the observation of the patient's facial colour,
body shape and body movement and hearing the patient's voice and other sounds: thus
observation precedes interrogation. As soon as the patient comes in, the diagnostic process
has already started: we observe the movement of the patient (whether slow or quick, for
example), the complexion, the body shape, to assess it in terms of Five Elements, the sound
of the voice and any smell emanating from the patient.
   I usually start the interrogation by asking the patient about the main problems that bring
him or her to me: I let the patient speak freely first without interrupting. I always make a
note of any peculiar expressions the patient might use. As indicated above, Western patients
will obviously use diﬀerent expressions from those used by Chinese patients. I never
discount a patient's turn of phrase as it can usually be interpreted in terms of Chinese
diagnosis.
   Examples of peculiar descriptions of symptoms from my practice with English patients
might include "a feeling of bu erflies in the stomach", a "feeling as if the stomach is having
an argument with itself", etc. As the patient is describing the main problem or problems, I
am already thinking of various pa erns of disharmony that might be causing it or them, and
I therefore start asking questions to confirm or exclude the particular pa ern of disharmony
I had in mind.
   After patients have finished reporting the main problems for which they are seeking
help, and after I have broadly decided on the pa erns of disharmony involved, I then
proceed to ask more questions, generally following either the traditional 10 questions or the
16 questions that are indicated later in this chapter. This is done for two reasons: first,
because the answers to these further questions may confirm the pa erns of disharmony
diagnosed and, second, because they may bring up other problems which the patient has
overlooked.
   I generally look at the tongue and feel the pulse towards the end of the interrogation,
again to confirm further the pa erns of disharmony. However, it is important to note that
the tongue and pulse are not simply used to confirm the diagnosis of a pa ern of
disharmony: very often they clearly show the existence of other pa erns which were not
evident from the symptoms and signs. In this case, we should never discount the findings of
the tongue and pulse but we should always ask further questions to confirm the pa erns of
disharmony shown by the tongue and pulse. Even if there are no further symptoms, we can
still rely on the tongue and pulse signs as the basis to diagnose a certain pa ern of
disharmony. For example, a patient may come to us complaining of dizziness and, on the
basis of symptoms and signs, we diagnose that the prevailing pa ern causing the dizziness
is that of Phlegm. When we then observe the tongue, we find that the tongue, besides being
Swollen (indicating Phlegm) is also clearly Purple; this is a definite sign of Blood stasis even
if the patient has no symptoms of it.
   In a few cases, the tongue and pulse may show conditions that are actually opposite to
that indicated by the pa erns of disharmony. For example, a person may suﬀer from a very
clear Yang deficiency and the pulse is Rapid or, vice versa, the person has clear symptoms
and signs of Heat but the pulse is Slow. We should never discount these contradictory signs
and we should always try to find their cause.

    TIME SCALE OF SYMPTOMS
   After this step, I would continue asking other questions, broadly following the 16
questions discussed below to find out whether there are other symptoms and signs that the
patient might have forgo en about. This is always followed by asking about past history of
any other diseases or operations.
   When asking about various problems the patient has or has had, it is important to
establish the exact time of onset. It is my experience that patients nearly always
underestimate the length of time that they have suﬀered from a particular problem.
Therefore if, when asked how long the particular problem has existed, a patient says "I
cannot remember exactly, probably 5-7 years", we can be almost certain that the onset was at
the higher point of the range oﬀered by the patient, that is, 7 years or more.
   Establishing the time of onset of a problem accurately is important in many cases
because it may establish a causality that neither the patient nor the doctor or consultant has
observed, and this happens frequently in practice. Examples of events (besides the
traditional causes of disease, e.g. emotional problems, diet, etc.) that may be the
unrecognized trigger of a particular problem are:

         • an operation
         • an accident
         • an immunization
         • the menarche
         • the menopause
         • childbirth.
   For example, a patient may develop abdominal pain after an abdominal operation from
adhesions; someone may develop backache and neck ache after an accident which had been
forgo en; postviral fatigue syndrome (myeloencephalitis, ME) may develop after a series of
immunizations prior to travel abroad; young girls suﬀering from migraine may have
forgo en that the onset coincided with the menarche (this has important repercussions on
the diagnosis and treatment); a change in the emotional state may be related to the onset of
the menopause; asthma or migraine may start after childbirth.
   Box 28.3 summarizes the main "trigger events" in patients" lives.

          BOX 28.3        TRIGGER EVENTS IN PATIENTS" LIVES
         • An operation
         • An accident
         • An immunization
         • The menarche
         • The menopause
         • Childbirth

    INTEGRATION OF INTERROGATION WITH
OBSERVATION
   The interrogation should be integrated seamlessly with observation. All the time while
the patient is talking we should observe the facial complexion, the eyes and other features;
this is important not only for the observation itself but also to observe any changes that take
place during the interrogation. For example, frequently women develop a light, red rash on
the neck as they relate their symptoms; I interpret this as a sign of Liver-Heat and one that
often reflects the emotional origin of a problem.
   Another possible change that should be observed during the interrogation is a change in
the tone and pitch of voice. If the voice becomes weaker and sounds sad, this indicates that
sadness or grief are at the root of the problem, in particular of the specific problem being
related. For example, if a woman's voice becomes weak and sad as she reports that her
periods have stopped, it may indicate that sadness or grief aﬀecting the Lungs and Heart are
the root of this particular problem. Conversely, if the voice becomes stronger and assumes a
higher pitch as the patient relates a particular problem, it may indicate that that problem is
due to anger or repressed anger. Often a patient may try to hide a particular emotion; for
example by laughing inappropriately during the interrogation; the hidden emotion is often
sadness or grief, especially in societies where expression of one's feelings is somewhat
discouraged.

  IDENTIFICATION OF PATTERNS AND
INTERROGATION
   After the patient has finished describing the main problem or problems, we start asking
questions to organize the presenting symptoms and signs into pa erns. While we ask
questions, we still observe the complexion, eyes, shape of facial features, sound of voice,
smells, etc., to be integrated with the findings from the interrogation. Once we are
reasonably confident in having identified the pa ern or pa erns involved, we must continue
the interrogation often to exclude or confirm the presence of other pa erns that may stem
from the existing ones. For example, if there is Liver-Blood deficiency, I would always check
whether this has given rise to Heart-Blood deficiency (especially if the observation leads me
to believe this) and would therefore ask questions to exclude (or confirm) the presence of
this pa ern. If there is a Liver deficiency, in women especially (for example, if a woman
suﬀers from amenorrhoea), even though the pa ern of Liver-Blood deficiency may be very
clear, I would always check whether there is a Kidney deficiency. If there is Liver-Qi
stagnation, I would check whether this has given rise to some Heat; if there is a Spleen
deficiency, I would check whether there is also a Stomach deficiency, etc.
   It is important to remember, therefore, that the interrogation is aimed not only at finding
out the main pa ern or pa erns of disharmony but often also at excluding certain pa erns
of disharmony. Table 28.1 shows the main pa erns that I usually exclude or confirm in the
presence of a presenting pa ern.

  TONGUE AND PULSE DIAGNOSIS:
INTEGRATION WITH INTERROGATION
      Finally, I look at the tongue and feel the pulse: this is done not only to confirm the pa ern
or pa erns identified from the interrogation but also to see whether the tongue and pulse
indicate the presence of pa erns not evident from the clinical manifestations. This occurs
frequently in practice and is the real value of tongue and pulse diagnosis; if tongue and
pulse diagnosis were used simply to confirm a diagnosis, there would be no point in
carrying out this step.
      Very often the tongue and pulse add valuable information to the findings from
interrogation and should never be discounted. For example, a patient may complain of
various symptoms and we diagnose Liver-Qi stagnation; if the tongue has a deep Heart
crack, this tells us that the patient has a constitutional tendency to Heart pa erns and a
constitutional tendency to be more aﬀected by emotional problems. Case history 28.1 is a
good illustration of this.

                           Case History 28.1
                    A 24-year-old woman complained of chronic aches in her knees, wrists
             and ankles. She also suﬀered from chronic tiredness, dizziness and loose
             stools. Her periods were regular and lasted only 3 days. Apart from this, she
             had no other symptoms. Her clinical manifestations indicate a deficiency of
             Blood (tiredness, dizziness, scanty periods) and a Spleen deficiency
             (tiredness, loose stools). The joint ache may be due to invasion of Cold and
             Dampness (she lived in a particularly damp area of the British Isles) but it is
             also aggravated by the underlying Blood deficiency (Liver-Blood not
             nourishing the sinews).
                    However, the pulse and tongue indicated totally diﬀerent pa erns. Her
             pulse was Overflowing on both Front positions and her tongue was very Red,
             with a redder tip with red points and a Heart crack. Thus, every sign of the
             pulse and tongue clearly indicated Heart-Fire; she had not related any
             symptom that would indicate this apart from thirst (which I asked her about
      after seeing her tongue and feeling her pulse). I came to the conclusion that
      she was suﬀering from severe emotional problems that were probably quite
      long standing and deriving from her childhood (due to the Heart crack). The
      acupuncturist who had been treating her and had referred her to me
      confirmed this. This is therefore a good example of a case when the pulse and
      tongue throw an entirely diﬀerent light on the diagnosis; for this reason, the
      findings of pulse and tongue diagnosis should never be discarded when they
      do not fit the symptoms and signs. A further confirmation of the accuracy of
      the diagnosis based on the pulse and tongue was the patient's reaction to the
      herbal formula prescribed. I totally ignored the presenting symptoms and,
      only on the basis of the findings from the pulse and tongue, prescribed a
      variation of the formula Gan Mai Da Zao Tang Glycyrrhiza-Triticum-Zizyphus
      Decoction (which calms the Mind and nourishes the Heart) with the addition
      of Yuan Zhi Radix Polygalae tenuifoliae , Shi Chang Pu Rhizoma Acori graminei
      and Long Chi Dens Draconis with good results.

         Remember : the tongue and pulse may indicate the presence of pa erns
      not evident from the clinical manifestations.
   Case history 28.2 is another example of the importance of pulse and tongue in diagnosis
and how these two factors can point to a completely diﬀerent set of pa erns which would
not emerge from a superficial examination of symptoms.

              Case History 28.2
         A 33-year-old woman had been suﬀering from abdominal distension and
      pain for 6 years. Her bowel movements were regular, occurring every day.
      She was under stress at work. She appeared as a very confident and balanced
      young professional woman.
         Diagnosis : At fist sight, this seems an obvious and simple case of Liver-Qi
      stagnation deriving from stress at work and probably an irregular diet (these
      two causes of disease often go together). However, her pulse and tongue
      showed a totally diﬀerent story. Her tongue was Red on the sides, and had a
      deep Heart crack and a sticky-yellow coating. Her pulse was Slippery and
      quite Overflowing on the Heart position. Her eyes lacked lustre.
         The deep Heart crack on the tongue clearly indicates deep-seated and
      long-standing emotional problems that go beyond just stress at work; this
      was confirmed by the Overflowing quality of the Heart pulse and the lack of
      lustre of her eyes. Therefore, the tongue and pulse showed a completely
      diﬀerent picture to the image she tried to project: she obviously suﬀered from
      deep emotional problems most probably dating back to her childhood or
      teenage years. I did not feel it appropriate to delve into this during the first
      consultation but, on asking, she did confirm that she suﬀered from deep
      depressions, irregular moods, gloominess, irritability and anxiety.
   Besides giving extremely valuable information for diagnosis, the tongue and pulse are
very important also to determine the treatment principle. In fact, they are very important to
help us discriminate when a Fullness or Emptiness predominates. For example, in chronic
ME (postviral fatigue syndrome), there is always a combination of Dampness (or Damp-
Heat) with Spleen deficiency; it is therefore important to determine whether we should
concentrate on tonifying the Spleen or on resolving Dampness. The tongue and pulse are
important to help in determining this: if the tongue has a fairly thick coating and the pulse is
Slippery, we should probably concentrate on resolving Dampness.
   An even more important case is that of cancer. I usually use Chinese medicine as an
adjuvant to Western therapies for cancer. Thus, if a patient is undergoing chemotherapy, I
would not treat the cancer but would support the body's Qi and the immune system with
herbs to tonify Qi, Blood or Yin. After the end of chemotherapy or after surgery, I assess the
tongue and pulse to get an idea of whether the pa erns that caused the cancer are still
active. In other words, even after surgery to remove a tumour (normally caused by Blood
stasis, Phlegm or Toxic Heat, or a combination of these), I assess the situation to determine
whether such pathogenic factors are still present and how "active" they are. The tongue and
pulse are important to determine this: if the tongue is Red, with red points and a sticky
coating, and the pulse is Rapid and Slippery or Wiry, I assume that, in spite of the surgery,
the pathogenic factors are very much active and I therefore administer herbs aimed at
expelling such factors, together with anticancer herbs. If, on the other hand, the tongue is
not Red and does not have red points or a sticky coating, and the pulse is Weak, Deep and
Fine, I dedicate my a ention to tonifying the body's Qi and strengthening the immune
system.
   Case histories 28.3 and 28.4 illustrate the process of interrogation.

               Case History 28.3 (Fig. 28.3)
          A 37-year-old woman comes in: she is rather thin, pale without "lustre",
      she walks slowly and her voice is rather low. As she sits down, we notice that
      her hair is dry and lifeless and that she looks and sounds in rather low spirits.
      At this point, a first tentative diagnosis is made already as the thin body, dull-
      pale complexion, dry hair and low spirits all point to Blood deficiency (this
      tentative conclusion is illustrated by a triangle): we know that this is all the
      more likely as Blood deficiency is common in women. However, as
      mentioned above, we must absolutely keep an open mind and be prepared to
      acknowledge that the patient does not suﬀer from Blood deficiency: if we do
      not keep an open mind, there may be the danger that our whole interrogation
      is biased, "forcing" the clinical manifestations into the preconceived pa ern
      of Blood deficiency.

            FIG. 28.3   Case history 28.3 : process
          As we ask her about her chief complaint, she reports suﬀering from
      premenstrual tension, something that does not directly confirm the diagnosis
of Blood deficiency. Since the main complaint is premenstrual tension
(illustrated by a double-line box), we immediately think of Liver-Qi
stagnation first as this is the most common cause of this condition (illustrated
by a triangle): however, we also keep in mind that there are other possible
causes of premenstrual tension, some Full (such as Phlegm-Fire) and some
Empty (such as Liver-Blood deficiency or Kidney deficiency). We therefore
start asking questions to confirm or exclude Liver-Qi stagnation. The
questions and answers are as follows:
   • What are the main manifestations of the premenstrual tension:
irritability or depression? She says both, but more depression and crying than
irritability. We ask this question to help diﬀerentiate a Full (in which
irritability predominates) from an Empty (in which depression predominates)
condition of premenstrual tension.
   • Is there breast distension? Yes. We ask this question to confirm whether
or not there is Liver-Qi stagnation: a pronounced feeling of distension
indicates Liver-Qi stagnation. In this case, there is a feeling of distension but it
is not that pronounced.
   • Is there epigastric or abdominal distension? Very li le.
   • Is the period cycle regular? Yes. We ask this question to confirm whether
there is Liver-Qi stagnation or not, as a severe Liver-Qi stagnation may make
the period irregular.
   • Is the period painful? No, but there is distension. We ask this question
because we have ascertained that there is some Liver-Qi stagnation and the
next step is to enquire whether this has led to Blood stasis: the absence of
menstrual pain tells us that there is no Blood stasis.
   • What colour is the menstrual blood? Bright-red. We ask this question as
a further aid to confirm or exclude the presence of Blood stasis: the bright-red
colour confirms that there is no Blood stasis.
   • How many days does the period last? Three days. This confirms that
there is Blood deficiency.
   At this point, a further picture is tentatively created in our mind: it seems
quite clear now that there is some Liver-Qi stagnation causing the
premenstrual tension but this is not too pronounced and most probably is
secondary to the Liver-Blood deficiency (a situation that is very common in
women). This conclusion is illustrated by a single-line box. It remains now to
check that there are no other pa erns: a very common one in this situation
would be a Kidney deficiency. We therefore ask the following questions:
   • Do you ever suﬀer from backache? No.
   • Do you ever suﬀer from dizziness? Yes.
   • Do you ever suﬀer from tinnitus? No.
   • Is your urination too frequent? No.
   • Do you ever suﬀer from night sweating? No.
   The absence of backache, tinnitus, frequent urination and night sweating
indicates the absence of a Kidney deficiency (this is indicated by a do ed
box); although there is some dizziness, in the absence of other Kidney
symptoms it must be caused by the Blood deficiency. In order to confirm the
diagnosis of Blood deficiency unequivocally, we ask a few more questions
about this:
   • Do you ever experience some tingling of the limbs? Yes.
   • Do you ever experience blurred vision? Yes, sometimes.
   • Do you ever feel depressed? Yes.
   • Do you ever have a feeling of aimlessness or confusion about what
direction to take in life? Yes.
   These four further symptoms confirm the deficiency of Liver-Blood
unequivocally: the depression, feeling of aimlessness and confusion about
life's direction are due to the Ethereal Soul being unrooted in Liver-Blood.
Why deficiency of Blood of the Liver and not of other organs? The scanty
period, dry hair and blurred vision point to Blood deficiency of the Liver.
However, we should check whether there might not be also a Blood
deficiency of another organ and especially of the Heart. We therefore ask the
following questions:
   • Do you ever suﬀer from palpitations? No.
   • Do you suﬀer from insomnia? No.
   The answer to these two questions allows us to exclude the presence of
Heart-Blood deficiency (illustrated by a do ed box). Finally, as there is Liver-
Blood deficiency, we should check whether this has progressed to Liver-Yin
deficiency. We therefore ask the following questions:
   • Do you ever suﬀer from dry eyes? No.
   • Dry and bri le nails? No.
   • Dry menstrual blood? No.
   The negative answer to these three questions tells us that there is no Liver-
Yin deficiency (illustrated by a do ed box). Thus, we have established that the
main problem is a deficiency of Liver-Blood giving rise to a secondary
stagnation of Liver-Qi; the fact that the Liver-Qi stagnation is secondary is
important for the treatment principle as this means that we should
concentrate our a ention on nourishing Liver-Blood and only secondarily on
moving Liver-Qi.
   Before concluding the interrogation, we should ask about any other
symptoms to make sure that there are no other pa erns; we therefore ask
about any headache, chest pain, abdominal pain, stools and urine, sleep and
sweating: no further symptoms are reported.
   It is now time to look at the tongue and feel the pulse. Her tongue is Pale,
slightly Swollen, especially on the sides and with a sticky-white coating. Her
pulse was Choppy on the left and Weak on the right.
   Being Pale, the tongue confirms the Blood deficiency but it also shows
other pa erns that had not emerged from the interrogation: the swelling on
the sides indicates Spleen deficiency and the sticky coating indicates
Dampness. A Spleen deficiency with some Dampness is one of the most
common conditions in practice and it is therefore not surprising to find it
reflected on this patient's tongue. Having noticed this on her tongue we must
go back to ask some more questions to confirm that there is a Spleen
deficiency with some Dampness. We therefore ask the following:
   • Do you feel easily tired? Yes. This tells us that there might be some
Spleen deficiency.
   • How is your appetite? Poor.
   • Do you have any digestive problems? Fullness after eating? A sticky
taste? Epigastric pain? The patient reports no epigastric pain but does have
some feeling of fullness after eating. This confirms the Dampness.
   • Do you ever experience a feeling of heaviness? Yes, slightly. This further
confirms the presence of Dampness.
   As for the pulse, the Weak quality on the right confirms the Spleen
deficiency while the Choppy quality on the left confirms the Blood deficiency.
   In conclusion, there is Liver-Blood deficiency, Spleen-Qi deficiency, a
secondary stagnation of Liver-Qi and some Dampness; thus, there are two
Empty and two Full pa erns. The Empty character of the pulse is important
in guiding us to the right treat-ment principle, which in this case must be pri-
marily to nourish Liver-Blood and tonify Spleen-Qi and secondarily to move
Liver-Qi and resolve Dampness.

         Case History 28.4 (Fig. 28.4)
   A 42-year-old woman complains of having suﬀered benign positional
vertigo for the last 20 years. As she comes in, we notice that she is thin, she
walks rather slowly, she is quiet, her voice is low and her eyes are slightly
dull. These signs derived from observation give us a very first impression of
her condition and they clearly point to a deficiency. In addition, the dullness
of her eyes indicates that emotional problems may be the cause of her
condition. As she sits down, we start asking about her symptoms in greater
detail. She says that she has been suﬀering from infrequent a acks of vertigo
for the past 20 years and that these got worse and more frequent after the
birth of her second daughter two and a half years ago. The aggravation of the
symptoms after childbirth leads us to think of a Kidney deficiency as one of
the possible pa erns. During the a acks of vertigo, she suﬀers from very
severe dizziness so that the room seems to be spinning around and she
vomits; the a acks usually occur in the mornings and are aggravated by lying
down and ameliorated by si ing. The severity of the vertigo clearly indicates
that it is due to a Full pa ern; therefore, from the few signs and symptoms
gleaned from the initial observation and interrogation, we can conclude that
there is a mixed condition of Fullness and Emptiness. The severe vertigo
could be due to either Liver-Yang rising or Liver-Wind. In between the a acks
of severe vertigo she also suﬀers from bouts of mild dizziness. In contrast to
the a acks of severe vertigo, the bouts of mild dizziness must be due to a
deficiency, probably of the Kidneys. At this point we have reached some
temporary conclusions and we can hypothesize that she suﬀers from Liver-
Yang rising (causing the severe vertigo and possibly vomiting) stemming
from a Kidney deficiency (causing the bouts of mild dizziness and also the
aggravation of vertigo after childbirth).

                           Case history 28.4 : process
   We now need to ask about other symptoms and she reports feeling cold in
general and suﬀering from chilblains in winter. In order to confirm or exclude
the pa ern of Kidney deficiency we ask about backache, tinnitus, night
sweating and urination: she does suﬀer from chronic lower backache and
frequent urination with pale urine. Considering the general cold feeling, the
backache, the frequent urination, the bouts of mild dizziness and the
aggravation after childbirth, we can diagnose the pa ern of Kidney-Yang
deficiency. We can also deduce that the Kidney deficiency is the underlying
condition for the rising of Liver-Yang.
   We then ask about her periods, an essential question in all women, and
she reports no problems in this area: the periods come regularly, they are not
too heavy or too scanty and not painful.
   As we know that Phlegm is a frequent cause of dizziness and vertigo, we
need to ask questions to confirm or exclude the possibility of the interaction
of Phlegm and Liver-Yang rising as a cause of her vertigo. Her body shape
does not point to Phlegm as she is thin (Phlegm tends to cause obesity);
however, that is not to say that thin people never suﬀer from Phlegm. We ask
her whether she suﬀers from catarrh and she does say that she often has to
clear her throat in the morning and if she gets a cold, it frequently goes to her
chest producing a lot of sputum. She also occasionally suﬀers from a feeling
of oppression of the chest; these symptoms together with the vomiting during
the a acks of vertigo point to Phlegm as a concurrent cause of vertigo.
   Her tongue has Red sides and apart from that it is fairly normal; the
tongue therefore does not show any signs of Phlegm as it is not Swollen and
does not have a sticky coating. This does not mean that there is no Phlegm
but simply that Phlegm is an accompanying pa ern and a further cause of the
vertigo secondary to that of Liver-Yang rising. Her pulse is Weak in general,
Choppy and Weak on the left and especially Weak on both the Rear positions.
The pulse therefore clearly shows only the deficiency pa erns of her
condition, that is, Kidney-Yang deficiency and Spleen-Qi deficiency, which is
at the root of Phlegm. This is a clear example of a case when the pulse and
tongue show diﬀerent aspects of the condition: the pulse shows the
underlying deficiency condition whereas the tongue shows Liver-Yang rising.
We should not expect the pulse and the tongue always to accord with each
other (in this case, we might have expected a Wiry pulse to accord with the
      Red sides of the tongue) as they often show diﬀerent aspects of a complex
      condition.
         In conclusion, there are two deficiency pa erns: Kidney-Yang deficiency
      and Spleen-Qi deficiency (which are the Root), and two full pa erns: Liver-
      Yang rising and Phlegm (which are the Manifestation). As far as the severe
      vertigo is concerned, Liver-Yang rising is primary in relation to Phlegm. The
      treatment principle in this case would therefore be to treat both the Root and
      the Manifestation by simultaneously tonifying Kidney-Yang, tonifying
      Spleen-Qi, subduing Liver-Yang and resolving Phlegm. In this case we treat
      the Root and the Manifestation simultaneously because the a acks of vertigo
      are relatively infrequent, coming about every 6 months; had the a acks of
      vertigo been much more frequent, we should have concentrated on treating
      the Manifestation, that is, subduing Liver-Yang and resolving Phlegm.
   In conclusion, Box 28.4 lists the order I usually follow in my interrogation.

          BOX 28.4          ORDER OF QUESTIONS IN
      INTERROGATION
         • Ask about the presenting problem le ing the patient speak freely.
         • Ask specific questions to determine the pa ern or pa erns causing the
      presenting problem. or problems trying to establish the time of onset
      accurately.
         • Ask questions to exclude or confirm other pa erns.
         • Ask more questions broadly following the 16 questions.
         • Ask about past diseases and operations.
         • Look at the tongue and feel the pulse.
         • Ask about any family illnesses such as asthma, eczema, heart disease.
         • Inquire about the patient's emotional life, family life and working
      conditions to try to establish the cause of the disease.

    THE 10 TRADITIONAL QUESTIONS
   The interrogation is traditionally carried out on the basis of 10 questions. This practice
was started by Zhang Jing Yue (1563-1640) but the 10 questions used by subsequent doctors
diﬀered slightly from those found in Dr Zhang's book. The 10 questions proposed by Zhang
Jing Yue were as follows:

         1. Aversion to cold and fever
         2. Sweating
         3. Head and body
         4. The two excretions
         5. Food and drink
         6. Chest and abdomen
         7. Deafness
         8. Thirst
         9. Previous illnesses

           10. Causes of disease.
   Besides these questions, Zhang Jing Yue added two more, one regarding women's
gynaecological history and the other regarding children, which makes a total of 12
questions.
   Although these are usually referred to in Chinese books as "questions", they rather
represent areas of questioning. These varied a lot over the centuries, as diﬀerent doctors
placed the emphasis on diﬀerent questions.
   The most commonly used areas of questioning mentioned in modern Chinese books are
10, as listed in Box 28.5 .

           BOX 28.5           THE 10 QUESTIONS
          1. Aversion to cold and fever
          2. Sweating
          3. Head and body
          4. Chest and abdomen
          5. Food and taste
          6. Stools and urine
          7. Sleep
          8. Hearing and tinnitus
          9. Thirst and drink

             10. Pain
   Two areas of questioning are added for women and children, making a total of 12. It
must be stressed that not all these questions need be asked in every situation, nor are these
the only possible questions since each situation requires an individual approach and other
questions may be relevant.

     Limitations Of The 10 Traditional Questions
   One need not necessarily follow the above order of questioning. In fact, I personally
never do because the above order is strongly biased towards an interrogation of a patient
suﬀering from an acute, exterior condition, hence the prominent place aﬀorded to the
question about "aversion to cold and fever" which, in Chinese books, always comes first. In
interior conditions, I do ask about sensation of heat or cold to establish or confirm whether
there is internal Cold or internal Heat, but usually towards the end of the interrogation.
   There is no reason why we should limit our interrogation rigidly to the traditional 10
questions. Each patient is diﬀerent, with diﬀerent causes of disease and diﬀerent pa erns of
disharmony, and we need to adapt our questions to each patient's unique situation.
Moreover, we need to respond to a patient's mental state during an interrogation with
sensitivity and flexibility to put a patient at ease, especially during the first consultation. It
would be wrong, therefore, to ask the 10 questions routinely without adapting one's
approach to the concrete situation. For example, it might well be that a patient bursts into
tears as soon as he or she describes his or her main problem and we should react to this
situation in a sensitive and sympathetic manner.
   The 10 questions, as the basis of the interrogation in Chinese diagnosis, were formulated
during the early Qing dynasty in China, thus at a time and in a culture very diﬀerent than
ours. We should therefore not hesitate to change the structure and contents of our
interrogation to make it more suitable to our time and culture.
   I would add the following to the traditional 10 questions:

          • emotions
          • sexual symptoms
          • energy levels.
   In addition, I introduce a separate area of questioning concerning the limbs which
traditionally is included under "body".

    Questions On Emotional State
   An enquiry about the emotional life of the patient plays a role both in the general
enquiry to find the cause of the disharmony and in the specific enquiry to find the pa ern of
disharmony. A prevailing emotional state is a clinical manifestation just as any other and it
is therefore an important part of the pa ern of disharmony. For example, a propensity to
anger is a strong indication of Liver-Yang or Liver-Fire rising, sadness often indicates a Lung
deficiency, obsessive thinking points to a Spleen pa ern, etc.
   It may be that, for cultural reasons, there is no specific question regarding the emotional
state of the patient among the traditional 10 questions: Chinese patients tend not to talk
about their emotions and often express them as physical symptoms as a kind of agreed
"code" between patient and doctor. I list a few examples of the emotional meaning of
various symptoms expressed by Chinese patients below:

         1. "Feeling of oppression of chest" (Xiong Men ) often means that the
      patient is depressed.
         2. "Intense thirst" often indicates that the patient is angry.
         3. "Tiredness and dizziness" in a woman often means that she is
      depressed.
         4. "Lack of appetite" often means that the patient is depressed or
      experiences sexual frustration (the same emotions in a Western patient would
      be more likely to induce him or her to eat more and "pick" all the time).
         5. "Insomnia and palpitations" may indicate intense anxiety and fear.
         6. "Bi er pain" may indicate bi er experiences in the patient's life or a
      state of being embi ered.
         7. "Nausea" may indicate that the patient is worried or frustrated or
      depressed.

    Questions About Sexual Life
   Modern Chinese doctors never ask about sexual symptoms owing to the modern Chinese
prudery in sexual ma ers. However, this should always form part of the interrogation as it
provides further information on the symptomatology of the patient to arrive at a pa ern of
disharmony.

    Questions On Energy Levels
   An enquiry about energy levels is extremely important as it gives a very simple clue to
the presence of a possible Deficiency pa ern (excluding the few cases when a person may
feel tired from Excess conditions). This question is all the more important since lack of
energy is probably one of the main reasons for Western people to consult a practitioner of
Chinese medicine.

    THE 16 QUESTIONS
   Thus, bearing in mind the three new questions on the emotional state, sexual symptoms
and energy levels and a diﬀerent order of questioning, I would therefore propose to revise
the traditional 10 questions, making up a total of 16 questions as listed in Box 28.6 .

          BOX 28.6        THE 16 QUESTIONS
          1. Pain
          2. Food and taste
          3. Stools and urine
          4. Thirst and drink
          5. Energy levels
          6. Head, face and body
          7. Chest and abdomen
          8. Limbs
          9. Sleep

           10. Sweating
           11. Ears and eyes
           12. Feeling of cold, feeling of heat and fever
           13. Emotional symptoms
           14. Sexual symptoms
           15. Women's symptoms
           16. Children's symptoms
   Apart from adding four questions (on pain, emotional state, sexual symptoms and
energy levels), I have changed the order of the traditional 10 questions in accordance with
my clinical experience with Western patients and have split some questions into two (for
example, "Food and drink" into "Food and taste" and "Thirst and drink").
   I have relegated the questions about aversion to cold and fever to twelfth place because
they are usually asked towards the end of the interrogation to confirm the Hot or Cold
nature of a particular pa ern. The prominent place aﬀorded to aversion to cold or fever in
the traditional 10 questions is due to historical reasons; in fact, in the times when the
traditional 10 questions were formulated, febrile diseases were extremely common in China
and would have formed the major part of a doctor's practice.
   I have placed the questions on pain in first place in the revised 16 questions because that
is by far the most common problem that Western patients present in a modern practice. The
question on pain is followed by those about food, bowels, urination and thirst, again
because these questions cover a very large area of digestive and urinary problems in the
patients we see. The order in which the questions are listed is not necessarily that in which
they are asked; for example, in women, the questions about their gynaecological system
would be asked fairly early in the interrogation.
   The discussion that follows will often list the clinical significance of a given symptom, for
example "night sweating indicates Yin deficiency" or "thirst indicates Heat". It should be
pointed out that this approach actually contradicts the very essence of Chinese diagnosis
and pa erns according to which it is the picture formed by a number of symptoms and signs,
rather than individual symptoms, that ma ers. No symptom or sign can be seen in isolation
from the pa ern of which it forms part: it is the landscape that counts, not individual
features. Thus it is wrong to say "night sweating indicates Yin deficiency"; we should say
"in the presence of malar flush, a Red tongue without coating and a dry throat at night,
night sweating indicates Yin deficiency, while in the presence of a feeling of heaviness, a
sticky taste, a bi er taste, epigastric fullness, night sweating indicates Damp-Heat". It is only
for didactic purposes that we need to list symptoms and signs in isolation with their
possible diagnostic significance.
   However, after years of practice, in some cases one can deduce the pa ern even from an
isolated symptom or sign; this is possible because each symptom or sign within a pa ern
bears within it the "imprint" of the whole pa ern. This can be deduced mostly from
observation or hearing/smelling. For example, "mental restlessness" may be due to Full- or
Empty-Heat as indicated above and the diagnosis should be made on the basis of
accompanying symptoms. However, an experienced practitioner is able to simply observe
the patient and form an idea of whether the "mental restlessness" derives from Full- or
Empty-Heat. It is diﬃcult to describe how this is done, but mental restlessness from Full-
Heat manifests with more agitation, it is more "solid" and the patient is more restless; when
mental restlessness is due to Empty-Heat, the patient is restless but in a quieter way, there is
a vague feeling of anxiety without knowing why and the patient generally looks more
deficient.
   Another example would be that of cough, in this case using diagnosis from hearing.
Simply by hearing the patient cough, an experienced practitioner can deduce not only
whether the cough occurs within a pa ern of Phlegm or Dryness, but even whether it is
Cold-Phlegm, Damp-Phlegm or Phlegm-Heat.

    INTRODUCTION
   As mentioned in Chapter 28 , I have changed the order of the traditional 10
questions and I assign the first question to pain, but this is not to say that one
should always start by asking about pain. The order of questioning should be
flexible.
   In this chapter I will discuss pain and its diagnostic points in general. Pain in
various areas of the body is discussed under the relevant questions; for example,
the diagnosis of chest pain will be found under the questions related to "Chest
and abdomen".

    WHY WE ASK
   We need to ask about pain because the character, location and timing of pain
give a clear indication of the Full or Empty character of the condition and they
also clearly indicate various pathogenic factors such as Qi stagnation, Blood
stasis, Dampness, and so on.
   Obviously, another reason for asking about pain is that it is a very common
complaint, and often the one that leads our patients to seek help.

    WHEN WE ASK
   Obviously we need to ask about pain in great detail when this is the chief
complaint. However, even if the patient comes to us for a condition that does not
involve pain (e.g. asthma), we should always ask whether the person experiences
pain in any part of the body. On the one hand, this may uncover a condition that
the patient did not report spontaneously and, on the other hand, an analysis of
the character, location and timing of pain may help us to confirm the original
diagnosis; indeed, in some cases an analysis of the pain may also add a new
dimension to our original diagnosis. For example, a woman may present with a
chief complaint of mental depression which we diagnose as being caused by
Liver-Qi stagnation; before concluding the interrogation we should ask whether
she experiences any pain in any part of the body. If the patient tells us that she
suﬀers from abdominal pain and distension, this would clearly confirm the
diagnosis of Liver-Qi stagnation. To carry the example further, if she also suﬀers
from severe period pains, with dark, clo ed menstrual blood, this clearly tells us
that there is not only Liver-Qi stagnation but also Liver-Blood stasis. Since the
Liver-Blood stasis is shown purely by the menstrual pain (e.g. the tongue is not
Purple) we would not have known about it if we had not asked about pain.

     HOW WE ASK
   When asking about pain, we should ask systematically about the following
four aspects:

          • location
          • nature
          • timing
          • response to pressure and temperature.

     Location of pain
   The first obvious question is about the location of the pain. It is important in
this respect not to accept automatically the patient's description of the location of
the pain. Patients often have their own way of describing a certain location, a
common one being "stomach" when they mean lower abdomen. When the pain
is in the abdomen it is particularly important to establish exactly where it is,
according to the abdominal areas that are described in Chapter 16 , by asking the
patient to point to its location. This is even more important in children whose
terminology is obviously limited and who often refer to "tummy ache".
   In channel problems, it is also important to enquire exactly about the location
of the pain in order to identify the channel or channels involved. For example, if
a patient complains of shoulder pain, we should enquire clearly whether the
pain is in the front of (Lung channel), the centre (Large Intestine channel) or the
back of the shoulder (Small Intestine channel). However, in channel problems,
the identification of the exact location of the pain must be done also with the
help of palpation.

     Nature of pain
   After asking about the location, we should then ask about the nature of the
pain. First let the patient describe it spontaneously; do not suggest any special
terms. A potential diﬃculty here is the terminology used by the patient, which
will obviously be diﬀerent from that used in China. With experience, we learn
how to "translate" Western expressions into the Chinese equivalent. For
example, "bloating" indicates "distension", "feeling like a weight on the chest"
indicates "feeling of oppression", "feeling like being pulled down" in the
abdomen indicates a "bearing-down" feeling, and so on. After le ing patients
describe the nature of the pain, if it is still necessary, we can then ask about the
nature of the pain according to the traditional Chinese terminology, which,
often, Western patients recognize as a very accurate description of their pain. For
example, in cases of abdominal pain, when we ask, "Is the pain accompanied by
a feeling of heaviness?" many patients confirm that that is exactly how it feels.

     Timing of pain
    After asking about the location and nature of the pain, we should then ask
about the exact timing of pain as described below.

     Factors affecting pain
    Finally, we should ask about the reaction to pressure or temperature. When
asking about the reaction of pain to pressure, it is important to formulate the
questions in a way that Western patients can understand. Rather than asking, "Is
the pain be er or worse with pressure?" (as one might do with a Chinese
patient), we should ask something like, "Does the pain feel be er if you rub it or
press it, or do you actually dislike its being touched?"
    When asking about reaction of the pain to temperature, we should also do it
in a way that is readily understandable to Western patients. For example, if a
patient complains of joint pain, we should ask whether it feels worse when the
weather is cold and rainy. We should also enquire whether the application of
heat or cold ameliorates or aggravates the pain.
    Chinese medicine oﬀers a detailed classification of pain according to five
parameters:

           • area of pain
           • nature of pain
           • time of pain
           • factors aﬀecting pain
           • organ versus channel pain.

     AREA OF PAIN
    Localized pain is usually due to Phlegm, Blood stasis, or obstruction by Cold
or Dampness, or both.
    Moving pain is usually due to Qi stagnation (unless it is due to Wind in the
joints).

     NATURE OF PAIN
    In general, a pain or ache that is mild in nature indicates Deficiency, whereas
a sharp, severe pain is due to Fullness. It should be noted that a mild pain is
usually dull and that a "dull" pain may also be intense. For example, a headache
from Blood deficiency will be mild in its intensity and dull in nature; however,
an occipital headache from invasion of external Cold may be dull in its nature
but very intense. Thus when a patient complains of a "dull" headache, we
should clarify whether this is mild (suggesting Deficiency) or intense (suggesting
Fullness).
   The pain from Fullness is due to the obstruction of the channels by a
pathogenic factor. Possible factors are listed in Box 29.1 .

             BOX 29.1       PATHOGENIC FACTORS
      CAUSING FULL TYPES OF PAIN
             • Exterior pathogenic factor
             • Interior Cold or Heat
             • Stagnation of Qi
             • Stasis of Blood
             • Dampness
             • Phlegm
             • Retention of food
   All these pathogenic factors obstruct the circulation of Qi or Blood, or both,
and therefore cause pain. There is a well-known saying in Chinese medicine that
states: "Obstruction causes pain; if there is no obstruction there is no pain" (Bu
tong ze tong, tong ze bu tong ). Phlegm does not generally cause pain but it may do
so in a few cases.
   Deficiency may also cause pain through malnourishment of the channels. In
this case, the pain will be mild, more like an ache, and will be clearly alleviated
by rest.
   There are many diﬀerent types of pain and the main terms are explained
below.

     Soreness
   This is a dull ache that usually occurs in the four limbs or trunk. It is usually
due to a Deficiency condition or to Dampness.

     Pain With A Sensation Of Heaviness
   This is also a dull ache but accompanied by a sensation of heaviness; this
usually occurs in the limbs, head or the whole body. It is typical of Dampness or
Phlegm.

     Distending Pain
   This is a pain accompanied by a sensation of distension (bloating). Chinese
patients often actually say they have a "zhang tong " (i.e. a distending pain). No
Western patient will ever use this actual expression but this type of pain is very
common in Western patients. In England, they will usually say that they have a
pain with a "bloating" sensation, but very often they will not mention the
bloating unless asked. It is therefore very important to elicit the exact symptoms
and character of pain with a proper interrogation. A distending pain is typical of
Qi stagnation, especially of the Liver. However, it should be noted that other
organs may suﬀer from Qi stagnation too, notably the Stomach, Spleen and
Lungs. Thus, a distending pain in the lower abdomen usually indicates Liver- or
Spleen-Qi stagnation, in the hypochondrium Liver-Qi stagnation, in the
epigastrium Stomach-Qi stagnation, and in the chest Lung-Qi stagnation
(although this last one may also be due to the Liver).
   A distending pain in the head, such as that experienced during a headache or
a migraine, is due to Liver-Yang rising. Anglo-Saxon patients would usually call
this pain "throbbing" rather than "distending".
   "Distension" is both a symptom and a sign, that is, it indicates the subjective
bloating sensation of the patient, but the bloating may also be felt on palpation
when the area feels distended like a drum (this is more easily felt in the
epigastrium or lower abdomen). In gynaecology, a distending pain is seen in
dysmenorrhoea from Liver-Qi stagnation or premenstrual breast pain and
distension also from Liver-Qi stagnation. Pain with distension is usually of a Full
nature. Distending pain is treated with warm-pungent herbs that move Qi.
   Box 29.2 summarizes the stagnation pa erns underlying areas of distending
pain.

            BOX 29.2        AREAS OF STAGNATION OF QI
           • Lower abdomen: stagnation of Liver-Qi
           • Hypochondrium: stagnation of Liver-Qi
           • Epigastrium: stagnation of Stomach-Qi
           • Hypochondrium towards epigastrium: Liver-Qi invading the
        Stomach
           • Chest: stagnation of Lung-Qi or Liver-Qi

           Remember: "distension" and "fullness" are not the same.
        Distension manifests with a bloated feeling, whereas fullness
        manifests with a full feeling.

     Pain With A Feeling Of Fullness
   This is an ache or pain accompanied by a sensation of fullness; it usually
occurs only in the epigastrium or lower abdomen. A sensation of fullness should
be distinguished from distension (bloating). With distension, the patient feels
bloated (like a drum) and the area feels like a drum on palpation; with fullness,
the patient feels very full as if after a very heavy meal, perhaps also with a slight
nausea, and the area feels hard rather than distended on palpation. The
distension can actually be seen (and palpated); fullness cannot be seen but can be
felt on palpation.
   Typically, pain with a sensation of fullness indicates retention of food and is
related to the Stomach and Spleen. Pain with a feeling of fullness is usually of a
Full nature. Fullness is treated with digestive herbs.

     Pain With A Feeling Of Emptiness
   Pain with a feeling of emptiness indicates either Qi and Blood deficiency or
Kidney deficiency and it often occurs in the head.

     Pain With A Feeling Of Cold
   Pain with a feeling of cold is usually a sharp, stabbing or spastic pain that is
clearly accompanied by a pronounced feeling of cold or even shivering and is
alleviated by the application of heat. This type of pain usually occurs in the
abdomen or limbs and it indicates Full- or Empty-Cold, or Yang deficiency.

     Burning Pain
   Burning pain is accompanied by a burning sensation and it always indicates
Heat or Empty-Heat; it may occur in the epigastrium or in the limbs.

     Colicky Pain
   This is a sharp pain of a colicky, cramping nature; it occurs in the epigastrium
or, more usually, the lower abdomen. This pain usually indicates Cold in the
Intestines, but it may also be due to Blood stasis. In gynaecology, this pain is
seen in dysmenorrhoea from Cold in the Uterus. Colicky pain is of a Full nature.

     Spastic Pain
   This is a sharp pain accompanied by spasm (contraction) or a sensation of
spasm; it usually occurs in the limbs and is related to the sinews and therefore
the Liver. It may be due to Liver-Blood deficiency in conjunction with Liver-Qi
stagnation or Liver-Yang rising. In the la er instance, it may also occur on the
head. Spastic pain is either of a Full nature or a combination of Deficiency (of
Liver-Blood) and Fullness (stagnation of Qi).

     Pain With A Distressing Feeling
   This indicates a pain or ache, usually in the epigastrium or chest,
accompanied by a restless, undefined, anxious feeling and perhaps palpitations.
It is usually due to retention of Phlegm in the epigastrium aﬀecting the Heart. It
is also a typical symptom of rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel causing
anxiety and palpitations. This type of pain is usually due to a combination of
Deficiency (of the Liver, Spleen or Kidneys) and Fullness (rebellious Qi). In
gynaecology, this type of pain is seen in menopausal problems.
     Pain With A Sensation Of Stuffiness
   This is usually a dull ache accompanied by a feeling of "stuﬃness"; it usually
occurs in the epigastrium or chest. "Stuﬃness" may be defined as a mild feeling
of fullness with an important objective diﬀerence on palpation: fullness may be
felt on palpation as hardness, whereas with stuﬃness the epigastrium feels soft
on palpation. A feeling of ache and stuﬃness is usually due to a combination of
Deficiency (of the Spleen) and Fullness (Heat or Phlegm).

     Pushing Pain
   This is a sharp pain accompanied by a feeling as if something was pushing
outwards; it occurs in the hypochondrium or epigastrium and is due to severe Qi
stagnation.

     Pulling Pain
   This is a sharp pain accompanied by a sensation as if the skin were being
pulled; it occurs only on the head and is due to Liver-Wind. It is of a Full nature
(although Liver-Wind itself may derive from a Blood or Yin deficiency).

     Cutting Pain
   This is a very sharp pain that feels like a knife. It usually occurs in the lower
abdomen and is due to Blood stasis. It is definitely Full in nature.

     Throbbing Pain
   This pain is usually severe and it feels as if there was a throbbing or
pulsation. It usually occurs on the head from Liver-Yang rising. It is of a Full
nature (although Liver-Yang may rise from Blood or Yin deficiency).

     Boring Pain
   This is a severe pain that feels like the tip of a knife-blade, a nail or a screw; it
is fixed in its location. It is due to Blood stasis and is Full in nature. It may occur
in the lower abdomen, epigastrium, hypochondrium, chest or head. In
gynaecology, it is seen in dysmenorrhoea from Blood stasis.

     Lurking Pain
   Lurking pain, in Chinese called Yin Tong , which means "latent, hidden or
lurking" pain, is not severe, is not acute, is relatively easy to endure but chronic
and persistent. It indicates Qi and Blood deficiency or Empty-Cold in the Interior
leading to malnourishment of the channels. Lurking pain usually improves with
the application of heat; it generally occurs in the abdomen or lower back.
Box 29.3 summarizes the types of pain.

      BOX 29.3         TYPES OF PAIN
      • Soreness: Deficiency (four limbs or trunk) or Dampness
      • Heaviness: Dampness or Phlegm (limbs, head or whole
  body)
      • Distending: Qi stagnation (hypochondrium, epigastrium,
  lower abdomen, chest, head)
      • Fullness: retention of food (epigastrium, lower abdomen)
      • Emptiness: Qi and Blood deficiency or Kidney deficiency
  (head)
      • Feeling of cold: Cold or Yang deficiency (abdomen or limbs)
      • Burning: Heat or Empty-Heat (epigastrium or limbs)
      • Colicky: Cold or Blood stasis (epigastrium, lower abdomen)
      • Spastic: Liver-Blood deficiency with Liver-Qi stagnation
  (limbs, abdomen), Liver-Yang rising (head)
      • Distressing: Phlegm or rebellious Qi (chest, epigastrium)
      • Stuﬃness: Spleen deficiency with Heat or Phlegm (chest,
  epigastrium)
      • Pushing: severe Qi stagnation (hypochondrium,
  epigastrium)
      • Pulling: Liver-Wind (head)
      • Cu ing: Blood stasis (lower abdomen)
      • Throbbing: Liver-Yang rising (head)
      • Boring: Blood stasis (head, chest, hypochondrium,
  epigastrium, lower abdomen)
      • Lurking: Qi and Blood deficiency or Empty-Cold in the
  Interior (abdomen, lower back)

 TIME OF PAIN
Daytime pain is usually due to a dysfunction of Qi or Blood.
Pain at night is due to a deficiency of Yin or to Blood stasis.
Intermi ent pain is due to either Qi deficiency or Qi stagnation.
Continuous pain is due to Blood stasis.

 FACTORS AFFECTING PAIN
The main factors aﬀecting pain are as follows:

      • pressure
      • temperature
      • food and drink
           • bowel movement
           • movement and rest.

     Pressure
   Aggravated by pressure This indicates a Full condition (which may be
Dampness, Phlegm, Qi stagnation, Blood stasis or retention of food).
Aggravation by pressure in Full conditions is common in abdominal pain,
stomach ache, menstrual pain and joint pain.
   Ameliorated by pressure This indicates Deficiency (e.g. abdominal pain,
stomach ache, menstrual pain and joint pain).

     Temperature
   Alleviated by warmth If a pain is alleviated by the application of heat (such
as a hot-water bo le) this indicates that it is due to Cold or Yang deficiency (e.g.
backache, joint pain, stomach ache, abdominal pain and menstrual pain). If a
pain is alleviated by hot weather, this also indicates that it is due to Cold or Yang
deficiency (e.g. backache, joint pain). Similarly if the pain is aggravated by cold.
   Alleviated by cold No pain is generally alleviated by the application of cold,
except in the case of acute joint sprains. Similarly, no pain is usually alleviated
by cold weather.

     Food And Drink
   Aggravated by eating This indicates a Full condition of the Stomach.
   Ameliorated by eating This indicates an Empty condition of the Stomach.
   Aggravated by drinking cold liquids This indicates a Cold condition of the
Stomach.
   Aggravated by drinking hot liquids This indicates a Hot condition of the
Stomach.
   Ameliorated by drinking warm liquids This indicates a Cold condition of the
Stomach.
   Ameliorated by drinking cold liquids This indicates a Hot condition of the
Stomach.

     Bowel Movement
   Ameliorated by a bowel movement This indicates a Full condition of the
Intestines.
   Aggravated by a bowel movement This indicates an Empty condition of the
Intestines or Spleen.

     Movement And Rest
   Ameliorated by movement This indicates stagnation of Qi (e.g. abdominal
pain) or Cold (e.g. backache).
   Aggravated by movement This indicates a deficiency of Qi or Blood (e.g.
backache).
   Ameliorated by rest This indicates a deficiency of Qi or Blood (e.g. backache,
joint pain and menstrual pain).
   Aggravated by rest This indicates stagnation of Qi (e.g. joint pain, backache
and headache), stasis of Blood (e.g. joint pain, backache and headache) or Cold
(e.g. backache).
   Box 29.4 summarizes the factors aﬀecting pain.

          • Worse after bowel movement: Empty condition of Intestines
      or Spleen
           Movement and rest

          • Worse with rest: Qi stagnation, Blood stasis, Cold

     ORGAN VERSUS CHANNEL PAIN
   Besides the above diﬀerentiation, another important one is that between pain
due to involvement of the internal organs with their respective channels and
pain due to involvement of the channels only. There are four possible situations,
listed in Box 29.5 .
            BOX 29.5             CLASSIFICATION OF ORGAN
       AND CHANNEL PAIN
           • Channel pain deriving from a channel pathology only
           • Organ and channel pain deriving from an organ pathology
           • Organ pain deriving from organ pathology
           • Channel pain only deriving from organ pathology
    Most pains due to sprains, traumas or Painful Obstruction Syndrome (due to
Wind, Cold or Dampness) involve a channel pathology only. The second
possibility is that of an organ pathology causing a pain in the organ as well as in
its related channel, for example a shoulder pain on the Large Intestine channel
associated with Damp-Heat in the Large Intestine causing diarrhoea (Fig. 29.1 ).

    The third possibility is that of an organ pain deriving from an organ
pathology. This is of course a very common situation, for example abdominal
pain from Dampness in the Intestines, chest pain from Heart-Blood stasis, etc.
(Fig. 29.2 ).

       FIG. 29.2   Organ pathology leading to organ pain
    The fourth possibility is that of an organ pathology leading only to a pain in
its related channel, for example Damp-Heat in the Large Intestine manifesting
only with pain in the arm along the Large Intestine channel. This situation,
however, is rather rare (Fig. 29.3 ).

are:

    INTRODUCTION
   The questions regarding reactions to foods, appetite, hunger and taste are
aimed primarily at establishing the state of the Stomach and Spleen.

    WHY WE ASK
   We always need to ask about digestive symptoms because the Stomach and
Spleen are the source of Postnatal Qi and therefore a pathology in these two
organs eventually aﬀects other organs.
    WHEN WE ASK
   I always ask about the state of the digestive system before concluding the
interrogation of the patient, unless, of course, the presenting problem is a
digestive one.

    HOW WE ASK
   It is important to ask about digestive symptoms in detail. It would not suﬃce
to ask simply "Do you have any digestive complaints?" We need to ask whether
the patient ever experiences any distension, bloating, fullness, pain, heaviness,
hiccup, nausea, vomiting, belching, loose stools, diarrhoea, etc.
   The Stomach and Spleen are the Root of Post-Heaven Qi and their state
aﬀects all the other internal organs; for this reason, it is always necessary to ask
questions to assess their state. This is all the more important given the frequency
of digestive complaints in Western patients. The Stomach controls the ro ing
and ripening of food and for this reason it is compared to a bubbling cauldron in
the Middle Burner. The Spleen controls the transformation and transportation
(Yun Hua ) of Qi and it therefore aﬀects the transportation and transformation of
food essences in the Middle Burner. Thus, the Stomach and Spleen together are
responsible for the proper digestion of food. However, in Chinese medicine, the
function of the Stomach and Spleen goes beyond that of digesting food as, in the
process of doing so, they are the source of Food Qi (Gu Qi ), which, in turn,
forms the Gathering Qi (Zong Qi ) and True Qi (Zhen Qi ). Thus, the Stomach and
Spleen are the source of Post-Heaven Qi and an enquiry into the state of these
two organs is crucial in every case.
   The Stomach and Spleen are particularly important also because they are in
the Middle Burner with opposing directions of Qi: Stomach-Qi descends while
Spleen-Qi ascends. A normal coordination of these two directions of flow is vital
for a proper transformation and transportation of Qi, food essences and fluids;
these two organs are at a crucial crossroads in the Middle Burner and an
impairment of their movement of Qi has immediate repercussions on Qi,
Dampness and Phlegm pathology. In every pathology of the Stomach and Spleen
there is some derangement of the proper flow of Qi. For example, when
Stomach-Qi rebels upwards rather than descending, it causes symptoms such as
hiccup, nausea, vomiting and belching; even when Stomach-Qi is deficient it
may fail to descend properly and may cause some of the above symptoms but to
a much milder degree. When Spleen-Qi descends rather than ascends, it may
cause loose stools or diarrhoea.

  MAIN PATTERNS OF DIGESTIVE
SYMPTOMS
   The main pa erns causing digestive symptoms are:

          • Qi deficiency
          • Qi stagnation
          • Qi rebellious
          • Blood stasis
          • Dampness
          • Phlegm
          • retention of food.

     Qi Deficiency
   Qi deficiency of the Spleen causes poor appetite, loose stools and slight
abdominal distension. Qi deficiency of the Stomach causes poor appetite and
slight epigastric discomfort. If there is a pain, it would be slight, dull and be er
after eating.

     Qi Stagnation
   Qi stagnation causes distension, which aﬀects the epigastrium if the Stomach
is primarily involved or the abdomen if the Spleen is primarily involved. If there
is a pain, it would be strongly associated with distension. "Distension" is usually
described as "bloating" by patients in English-speaking countries.

     Qi Rebellious
   Qi rebellious of the Stomach causes belching, hiccup, nausea and vomiting.
Qi sinking of the Spleen (i.e. descending rather than ascending) causes loose
stools or diarrhoea.

     Blood Stasis
   Blood stasis causes intense, fixed, stabbing pain, which is epigastric in the
case of the Stomach, with possible vomiting of blood, and abdominal in the case
of the Spleen, with possibly blood in the stools.

     Dampness
   Dampness causes a feeling of fullness and heaviness in the epigastrium if the
Stomach is aﬀected, with a sticky taste and poor appetite, and in the abdomen if
the Spleen is aﬀected.

     Phlegm
      Phlegm causes a feeling of oppression; this usually aﬀects the epigastrium
rather than the abdomen and the Stomach more than the Spleen. There is also a
sticky taste, nausea and poor appetite.

          Retention Of Food
      Retention of food causes a feeling of fullness in the epigastrium if the
Stomach is aﬀected and in the abdomen if the Spleen is aﬀected; the la er aﬀects
children more than adults. In the case of the Stomach, there may sour
regurgitation, nausea and poor appetite.
      Table 30.1 illustrates the diﬀerentiation of symptoms between Stomach and
Spleen in the various pa erns.

      Thus, the five main sensations experienced in the digestive system are a
feeling of distension, fullness, oppression, stuﬃness and heaviness. Table 30.2
illustrates the pathology and diagnostic manifestation of these five sensations. 1

          FOOD
      Especially if the patient complains of digestive symptoms, it is imperative to
ask about the eﬀect of eating on pain. If a digestive pain is alleviated by eating it
means it is of an Empty nature; if it is aggravated by eating, it is of a Full nature.
   Food intolerance or allergies are generally due either to Spleen deficiency or
Stomach-Heat, depending on the reaction: if the intolerance or allergy manifests
with digestive problems and lethargy it may be due to Spleen-Qi deficiency,
while if it manifests with skin reactions it may be due to Stomach-Heat.
   A feeling of distension after eating indicates Qi stagnation; a feeling of
fullness indicates retention of food or Dampness; a feeling of oppression of the
epigastrium indicates Phlegm; a feeling of stuﬃness (a mild feeling of fullness
but the epigastrium is soft on palpation) indicates Heat or Phlegm occurring
against a background of Deficiency. A feeling of heaviness of the epigastrium
indicates the retention of Dampness or Phlegm.
   Digestive problems alleviated by the ingestion of warm liquids or aggravated
by cold liquids indicate Cold in the Stomach and Spleen while if they are
aggravated by the ingestion of warm liquids and alleviated by cold liquids it
means that they are due to Stomach-Heat.
   Inability to digest fats indicates Gall-Bladder Dampness.
   Box 30.1 summarizes the pa erns underlying digestive symptoms.

          BOX 30.1        DIGESTIVE SYMPTOMS
         • Food intolerance: Spleen deficiency or Stomach-Heat
         • Feeling of distension: Qi stagnation
         • Feeling of fullness: retention of Food or Dampness
         • Feeling of oppression: Phlegm
         • Feeling of stuﬃness: Deficiency with Heat or Phlegm
         • Feeling of heaviness: Dampness or Phlegm
         • Improvement on drinking warm liquids, aggravation by
      cold: Cold in Stomach and Spleen
         • Improvement on drinking cold liquids, aggravation by
      warmth: Stomach-Heat
         • Inability to digest fats: Dampness in Gall-Bladder

    APPETITE
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 69
   A normal appetite is an indication that the Stomach and Spleen are healthy.
For social and historical reasons, lack of appetite is always considered a bad sign
in China and always features as a prominent symptom in the pa ern of Spleen-
Qi deficiency. In the West, lack of appetite is less common and is not usually
considered a very important symptom unless, of course, it leads to anorexia.
Another cultural diﬀerence between Western countries and China is that when
Chinese people are under stress they lose their appetite, whereas in the West
patients tend to "pick" constantly, eat more or eat sweets when under stress.
   Lack of appetite indicates usually Spleen-Qi deficiency but it may also be due
to a Fullness and specifically to Dampness obstructing the Middle Burner; in this
case, it will be associated with a feeling of fullness and of mild nausea.

     Excessive Hunger
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 69
   Excessive hunger usually indicates Stomach-Heat; however, there is an
important exception to this rule. In the West, excessive hunger leading to
constantly "picking" is often a sign of emotional stress and frustration rather
than actual Stomach-Heat.
   Excessive hunger without any desire to eat is due either to Damp-Heat in the
Stomach or to Stomach-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat: Stomach-Heat causes
the feeling of hunger, but Dampness in the first instance or Stomach-Yin
deficiency in the second instance makes the patient reluctant to eat.

     Aversion To Food
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 69
   "Aversion to food" is called Yan Shi in Chinese and it indicates a strong
aversion to eating and to the smell of food. "Aversion to food" diﬀers from poor
appetite in so far as it implies a strong disgust of food. This symptom is
obviously seen in food poisoning but, in chronic cases, it may also be seen in
retention of food. If aversion to food is accompanied by a very thick, sticky taste,
it is due to Dampness in the Middle Burner aﬀecting the Liver, Gall-Bladder,
Stomach and Spleen. Aversion to food in pregnancy is due to the Qi of the
Penetrating Vessel rebelling upwards.

     Hunger But No Desire To Eat
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 69
   This symptom may seem paradoxical but it does occur occasionally: the
patient feels hungry or, more accurately, the Stomach feels hunger pangs but the
patient does not want to ingest food. This symptom may be due to two causes:
Damp-Heat in the Stomach (the Heat causes hunger but the obstruction of the
Middle Burner by Dampness makes the patient reluctant to eat), or the pa ern of
"Stomach strong-Spleen weak" (when a Stomach Full condition causes hunger
and a Spleen deficiency makes the patient reluctant to eat).
   Box 30.2 summarizes the pa erns underlying abnormal appetite symptoms.

          BOX 30.2        APPETITE
          Appetite
          • Normal appetite: good state of Stomach and Spleen

          Excessive hunger
          • Excessive hunger: Stomach-Heat
          • Excessive hunger without desire to eat: Damp-Heat in

    TASTE
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 69
   A normal taste sensation depends primarily on the state of the Stomach and
Spleen and it reflects a healthy state of these two organs and a normal state of
fluids. Thus, a loss of taste sensation often indicates a deficiency of Spleen and
Stomach. Loss of the sense of taste accompanied by oversecretion of saliva
indicates a deficiency of Stomach and Spleen with retention of Cold in the
Stomach. Loss of taste may also be due to retention of Dampness in the Middle
Burner.
   In most cases, a particular taste indicates a Full rather than an Empty
condition of the relevant organ.
   A bi er taste indicates either Liver-Fire or Heart-Fire; in the former case, the
bi er taste is more or less constant, whereas in the case of Heart-Fire it will be
present only in the morning after a bad night's sleep. A bi er taste may also
indicate Heat or Damp-Heat in the Gall-Bladder.

          • Bi er taste from Liver-Fire : constant.
          • Bi er taste from Heart-Fire : in the morning after a bad
      night's sleep.
   A sweet taste indicates either Spleen deficiency or Damp-Heat.
   A sour taste indicates retention of food in the Stomach, a disharmony of Liver
and Stomach, or Liver- and Stomach-Heat.
   A salty taste may indicate a Kidney-Yin deficiency or a severe Kidney-Yang
deficiency with fluids rising up to the mouth.
   A pungent taste indicates Lung-Heat or Stomach-Heat, or both.
   A sticky taste indicates Dampness or Phlegm, usually in the digestive system.
   Western patients are often unable to describe the kind of taste they
experience: very few report a pungent, sour or salty taste for example. Many
patients, when asked, are unable to say whether they experience a sticky taste or
not but quite a few report experiencing a "metallic" taste; I interpret this as a
"sticky" taste. It is due to Dampness.
   Box 30.3 summarizes the pa erns underlying particular tastes.

           BOX 30.3       TASTE
           • Loss of sense of taste: Stomach and Spleen deficiency,
      Dampness in Middle Burner
           • Bi er taste: Liver-Fire or Heart-Fire, Heat or Damp-Heat in
      Gall-Bladder
           • Sweet taste: Spleen deficiency or Damp-Heat
           • Sour taste: retention of food in the Stomach, disharmony of
      Liver and Stomach, Liver- and Stomach-Heat
           • Salty taste: Kidney deficiency
           • Pungent taste: Lung-Heat, Stomach-Heat
           • Sticky taste: Dampness

    NAUSEA AND VOMITING
   Hearing , Chapter 53 ; Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 69
   There are several Chinese terms referring to nausea and vomiting, expressing
varying characteristics or degrees of severity. The Chinese term E Xin means
"nausea", Ou means vomiting accompanied by a sound, Tu means vomiting
without sound, Gan ou indicates short retching with a low sound, and Yue
indicates long retching with a loud sound (before the Ming dynasty this term
indicated "hiccup"). The two Chinese terms Ou and Tu are usually used together
to indicate vomiting.
   Stomach-Qi normally descends; if it ascends it may cause nausea or vomiting,
or both. Thus, nausea and vomiting are by definition due to rebellious Stomach-
Qi ascending; this is not to say, however, that they are always due to a Full
condition as nausea and vomiting may also be due to a Stomach deficiency. The
pathological mechanism is diﬀerent in each case: in Full conditions of the
Stomach, Stomach-Qi rebels upwards actively , whereas in Empty conditions it
fails to descend. Therefore, although nausea and vomiting always involve
rebellious Stomach-Qi, this will be combined with various Stomach pathologies
of the Full or Empty type such as Stomach-Cold, Stomach-Heat, Stomach-Yin
deficiency, etc. This diﬀerent patho-logical mechanism explains the diﬀerent
action of the two points Ren-13 Shangwan and Ren-10 Xiawan: the former
actively subdues rebellious Stomach-Qi, whereas the la er helps Stomach-Qi to
descend.

           • In nausea and vomiting from Full conditions, Stomach-Qi
      rebels upwards (Ren-13 Shangwan).
           • In nausea and vomiting from Empty conditions, Stomach-Qi
      fails to descend (Ren-10 Xiawan).
   A mild feeling of nausea is usually due to a deficiency of Stomach-Qi, with
Stomach-Qi unable to descend. A strong feeling of nausea and vomiting is due to
rebellious Stomach-Qi ascending; this may be associated with stagnation, Cold
or Heat.
   Profuse and loud vomiting of food soon after eating indicates a Full condition
of the Stomach; vomiting of fluids with a low sound some time after eating
indicates an Empty condition of the Stomach.
   Vomiting of sour fluids indicates stagnant Liver-Qi invading the Stomach.
Vomiting of bi er fluids indicates Heat in the Liver and Gall-Bladder. Vomiting
of thin, watery fluids indicates Cold in the Stomach. Vomiting soon after eating
suggests a Heat condition while vomiting some hours after eating suggests a
Cold or Empty condition.
   Box 30.4 summarizes the pa erns underlying nausea and vomiting.

           BOX 30.4       NAUSEA AND VOMITING
           • Mild nausea: Stomach-Qi deficiency
           • Severe nausea/vomiting: rebellious Stomach-Qi
           • Vomiting soon after eating: Stomach Full condition
           • Vomiting of fluids: Stomach Empty condition
           • Vomiting of sour fluids: stagnant Liver-Qi invading the
      Stomach
           • Vomiting of bi er fluids: Heat in the Liver and Gall-Bladder
           • Vomiting of thin, watery fluids: Cold in the Stomach
           • Vomiting immediately after eating: Heat
           • Vomiting some hours after eating: Cold or Empty condition

    BELCHING
   Hearing , Chapter 53 ; Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 69
   Belching always indicates Stomach-Qi rebelling upwards. This may be due to
a purely Full condition, in which case the belching is violent and loud, or it may
be due to Deficiency, in which case the belching is mild and with a low sound.
   The most common cause of belching is Liver-Qi invading the Stomach and
causing Stomach-Qi to rebel upwards; this is accompanied by epigastric and
hypochondrial distension.
   Retention of food (common in children) may also cause belching, in which
case it is accompanied by sour regurgitation and epigastric fullness.
   Deficient causes of belching include Stomach- and Spleen-Qi deficiency and
Stomach-Yin deficiency; in these cases the belching is mild and its sound is weak.
   Box 30.5 summarizes the pa erns underlying belching.
          BOX 30.5        BELCHING
         • Loud belching: Full condition
         • Quiet belching: Empty condition (Stomach-Qi or Stomach-
      Yin deficiency)
         • With distension: stagnant Liver-Qi invading the Stomach
         • With sour regurgitation: retention of food

    SOUR REGURGITATION
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 69
   Sour regurgitation describes an acidy feeling in the oesophagus which comes
up into the mouth. Like belching, it is also a form of rebellious Stomach-Qi. The
most common cause is Liver-Qi invading the Stomach and causing Stomach-Qi
to rebel upwards.
   Retention of food is another possible cause of sour regurgitation. Other
causes include Dampness in the Stomach, which may be associated with Heat or
with Cold.
   Box 30.6 summarizes the pa erns underlying sour regurgitation.

          BOX 30.6        SOUR REGURGITATION
         • With acidity rising: stagnant Liver-Qi invading the Stomach
         • With feeling of fullness: retention of food or Dampness in the
      Stomach

    INTRODUCTION
   The bowel movement and urination reflect primarily the state of the Yang
organs and specifically the Large Intestine, Small Intestine and Bladder. Apart
from these organs, other ones also influence defecation and urination: in
particular, the Spleen, Liver and Kidneys influence defecation while the Kidneys,
Liver, Spleen and Triple Burner influence urination. Defecation and urination
generally reflect the state of organs in the Lower Burner and in particular the
transportation, transformation and excretion of fluids in the Lower Burner,
which is under the control of the Triple Burner.

    WHY WE ASK
   Questions about bowel movement and urination are important and should
always be asked: apart from telling us about the state of the digestive and
urinary systems themselves, they serve to establish the Full or Empty and Hot or
Cold nature of the condition.

    WHEN WE ASK
   Unless the presenting problem concerns the functions of urination and
defecation, I generally ask about these towards the end of the consultation.

    HOW WE ASK
   When asking about urination and defecation it is important to be specific:
asking "Are your bowels regular?" may elicit a positive response when the
patient means that he or she evacuates the bowels once every 3 days regularly .
Similarly, if we ask whether the urination is "frequent" (by which we mean "too
frequent") the patient might answer aﬃrmatively when it is normal. We should
therefore ask precisely how many times patients evacuate their bowels and how
many times they urinate in a day (bearing in mind seasonal variations, as
urination is generally less frequent in summertime).
   As for urination, we should also bear in mind diﬀerences between men and
women as women have a large bladder and need to urinate less frequently than
men. An added diﬃculty in most Western countries is that many people force
themselves to drink a lot of water in the mistaken belief that it flushes the
kidneys; this means that the urination will be much more frequent than normal
and that the colour of the urine will be paler, making diagnosing from urination
more diﬃcult.

    STOOLS
   Observation , Chapter 20 ; Hearing and Smelling , Chapter 54 ; Symptoms
and Signs, Chapter 72
   When asking about stools we should ask about the following aspects
systematically:

         • frequency
         • consistency
         • shape
          • colour
          • odour and sounds
          • abdominal pain related to evacuation.
   The bowel movement is an important indicator of the state of the digestive
system and specifically of the Large Intestine and Stomach. These two organs are
connected within the Bright-Yang system and their pathology is often
interconnected. For example, Heat in the Stomach is easily transmi ed to the
Large Intestine; Stomach-Qi failing to descend may cause constipation, etc.
However, other organs also play a role in defecation and especially the Liver,
which should assist defecation with its free flow of Qi, the Kidneys, which
control the two lower Yin orifices (i.e. the urethra and anus), and the Spleen,
which controls the transportation of Qi.
   The normal bowel movement should occur at least once a day. The stools
should be formed, and not too hard, not dry, and without excessive smell.
Evacuation should be easy and eﬀortless.

          The Large Intestine, Small Intestine, Stomach, Spleen, Liver,
      Kidneys and Triple Burner all aﬀect defecation.

     Frequency
   A normal bowel movement is once or twice a day. Any evacuation that
occurs with less frequency than this constitutes constipation. A bowel movement
(which may or may not be loose) occurring more than three times a day is
considered to be too frequent.
   Constipation is the most common disturbance of frequency of evacuation but
its clinical significance cannot be separated from the consistency of the stools.
Constipation indicates not only the infrequent passage of stools, but also
excessive dryness of the stools or diﬃculty and straining in passing stools.
   Acute constipation with thirst and yellow tongue coating indicates acute
Heat in the Stomach and Intestines.
   Chronic constipation in old people or women may be due to Blood or Kidney
deficiency; in this case the stools would be slightly dry and there would be other
signs of Blood or Kidney deficiency.
   If the stools are bi y, small and diﬃcult to pass, this indicates Liver-Qi
stagnation or Heat in the Intestines (if they are also dry); when it is due to Liver-
Qi stagnation, it often alternates with diarrhoea or loose stools as so often
happens in irritable bowel syndrome.
   Constipation with dry stools indicates Heat in the Large Intestine or Yin
deficiency and Dryness of the Stomach, Intestines or Kidneys. If there is
diﬃculty in evacuation but the stools are not dry, this indicates Liver-Qi
stagnation.
   Constipation with abdominal pain that is relieved by the bowel movement
indicates retention of food or Dampness in the Intestines; constipation with
abdominal pain and distension that is not relieved by the bowel movement
indicates Liver-Qi stagnation. Constipation with abdominal pain and a
pronounced feeling of cold indicates Cold in the Intestines.
   Spleen-Qi deficiency normally causes loose stools but in a few cases a severe
Spleen-Qi deficiency may cause constipation because the deficient Spleen-Qi fails
to move and transport. Constipation may also be caused by a so-called "shut-
down" of the Qi mechanism; this happens when there is an impairment of the
ascending and descending of Qi in the digestive system, which may be seen, for
example, after surgery.
   Alternation of constipation and loose stools indicates stagnant Liver-Qi
invading the Spleen.
   If the stools are not loose but very frequent and the person cannot hold them
easily, this indicates deficiency of the Central Qi, that is, the Qi of Stomach and
Spleen; it also indicates sinking of Spleen-Qi.
   Box 31.1 summarizes pa erns underlying constipation and increased
frequency.

          BOX 31.1        CONSTIPATION
          • Acute constipation with yellow tongue coating: Heat in
      Intestines
          • Chronic constipation in women: Blood or Kidney deficiency
          • Constipation with dry stools: Heat in the Intestines or Yin
      deficiency and Dryness
          • Small, bi y stools, diﬃcult to pass: Liver-Qi stagnation, Heat
      in the Intestines
          • Diﬃculty in evacuation, stools not dry: Liver-Qi stagnation
          • Constipation relieved by bowel movement: retention of food,
      Dampness in Intestines
          • Constipation with abdominal pain and distension: Liver-Qi
      stagnation
          • Constipation with colicky abdominal pain: Cold in the
      Intestines
          • Alternation of constipation and loose stools: stagnant Liver-
      Qi invading the Spleen
          • Frequent but not loose stools: Spleen-Qi sinking or
      deficiency of Central Qi

     Consistency
   The normal stool is well formed, not loose, not too dry and floating.
   An excessively dry stool indicates either Heat in the Intestines, Blood
deficiency (of the Liver) or Yin deficiency (which may aﬀect the Large Intestine,
Spleen, Liver or Kidneys).
   Loose stools generally indicate a deficiency of the Spleen or Kidneys, or both.
A deficiency of the Spleen is by far the most common cause of chronic diarrhoea
or loose stools; a Kidney deficiency is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in
the elderly. If the diarrhoea is severe and very watery, this usually indicates
Yang deficiency (of the Spleen and/or Kidneys, or both), whereas loose stools
usually indicate Spleen-Qi deficiency.
   The most common cause of chronic diarrhoea is Spleen-Qi or Spleen-Yang
deficiency. Chronic, watery diarrhoea occurring every day in the very early
morning is due to Kidney-Yang deficiency and is called "cock-crow diarrhoea"
or "fifth-hour diarrhoea" (this refers to the ancient Chinese way of measuring
time in each 24 hours).
   There are, however, also Full causes of diarrhoea and principally Dampness
(which could be associated with Heat or Cold) and Cold in the Spleen and
Intestines.
   The presence of a foul smell with the diarrhoea or loose stools suggests Heat
in the Intestines, whereas the absence of smell is either normal or suggestive of
Cold.
   The presence of pain with the diarrhoea or loose stools suggests Liver-Qi
stagnation, Cold or Damp-Heat.
   The presence of mucus in the stools indicates Dampness while the presence
of blood indicates deficient Spleen-Qi not holding Blood, Damp-Heat or Blood
stasis in the Intestines. Acute diarrhoea or loose stools are usually due to
invasion of external Dampness, which may be seen in food poisoning; with a
foul smell it is due to Damp-Heat, without smell to Damp-Cold.
   Undigested food in the stools, stools following blood or diarrhoea with
borborygmi indicates Spleen-Qi deficiency; a burning sensation of the anus
indicates Damp-Heat in the Intestines.
   Sticky stools that necessitate brushing the toilet with a toilet brush every time
indicate Dampness in the Intestines.
   Case history 31.1 illustrates a pa ern underlying diarrhoea.

                Case History 31.1
           A 25-year-old woman had been suﬀering from ulcerative
        colitis for 1 year, after the break-up of a relationship. Her main
        symptom was diarrhoea with blood and mucus in the stools but
        without pain. At the time of her consultation, she was taking oral
        prednisone.
           Apart from this she had no other symptoms except that her
        periods had not yet returned since stopping the contraceptive pill
      a year and a half previously. Her complexion was dull yellow and
      her skin was quite greasy.
         Her tongue was slightly Pale with a sticky yellow coating and
      her pulse was Weak on the right and noticeably Wiry on both Rear
      positions.
         Diagnosis: The abdominal symptoms of diarrhoea with mucus
      and blood and the sticky coating on the tongue clearly indicate
      Damp-Heat in the Intestines, in this case occurring against a
      background of Spleen-Qi deficiency as shown by the Pale tongue
      and the Weak pulse on the right. In intestinal diseases such as
      ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, the pulse is frequently Wiry
      on both Rear positions.
   Box 31.2 summarizes pa erns underlying loose stools and diarrhoea.

          BOX 31.2        LOOSE STOOLS/DIARRHOEA

         • Undigested food in the stools: Spleen-Qi deficiency
         • Mucus in stools: Dampness in Intestines
         • Burning sensation in the anus: Damp-Heat in the Intestines
         • Black or dark stools: Blood stasis
         • Blood before stools: Blood-Heat
         • Stools before blood: Spleen-Qi deficiency
         • Diarrhoea with borborygmi: Spleen-Qi deficiency
         • Sticky stools: Dampness in Intestine

     Shape
   Stools like small pellets indicate Liver-Qi stagnation, or Heat if they are also
dry. Long and thin stools like pencils indicate Spleen-Qi deficiency (bear in mind
that they could also indicate carcinoma of the bowel) (Fig. 31.1 ).

     Colour
   Normal stools are light-brown in colour. Pale-yellow stools indicate Empty-
Heat (of the Spleen, Large Intestine or Kidneys). Dark-yellow stools indicate
Full-Heat (of the Large Intestine). Dark stools may indicate the presence of occult
blood and they generally indicate Heat (of the Large Intestine). Pale, almost
white stools indicate Cold in the Large Intestine. Green stools indicate Liver-Qi
invading the Spleen. Red stools indicate the presence of fresh blood and this may
be due either to Heat in the Large Intestine or to Spleen-Qi deficiency. Greenish-
bluish stools indicate the penetration of external Cold into the Large Intestine
(common in babies).
   Black or very dark stools indicate Blood stasis. Bright-red blood coming
before the stools and splashing in all directions indicates Damp-Heat in the
Intestines. If the blood comes before the stools and is turbid and the anus feels
heavy and painful, this indicates Blood-Heat. If the stools come before the blood
and this is watery, it indicates that Spleen-Qi is deficient and is unable to hold
Blood.
   Box 31.3 summarizes the pa erns underlying stool colours.

             • Dark yellow: Full-Heat
             • Dark: Heat
             • Pale: Cold
             • Green: Liver-Qi invading Spleen

     Odour And Sounds
   Hearing and Smelling, Chapters 53 and 54
   Generally speaking, an absence of smell is either normal or it indicates Cold
in the Intestines. A strong, foul smell usually indicates Heat and especially
Damp-Heat. A sour smell indicates a disharmony of Liver and Spleen.
   Flatulence may be due to Liver-Qi stagnation, to Damp-Heat if there is a foul
smell, or to Spleen-Qi deficiency if there is no smell.
   Borborygmi with loose stools indicate Spleen deficiency; borborygmi with
abdominal distension and without loose stools indicate stagnation of Liver-Qi.
   Box 31.4 summarizes pa erns underlying odour and sounds.

          BOX 31.4        ODOUR OF SOUNDS
         • Absence of smell: Cold in the Intestines (or normal)
         • Strong, foul smell: Heat or Damp-Heat
         • Sour smell: disharmony of Liver and Spleen
         • Flatulence: Liver-Qi stagnation, Damp-Heat (if foul smell),
      Spleen-Qi deficiency (no smell)
         • Borborygmi: Spleen-Qi deficiency (with loose stools), Liver-
      Qi stagnation (with abdominal distension)

     Abdominal Pain Related To Evacuation
   The feeling of distension before evacuation indicates Liver-Qi stagnation.
Abdominal pain before evacuation but not relieved by it also indicates Liver-Qi
stagnation. Abdominal pain during evacuation (and generally relieved by it)
indicates Dampness in the Large Intestine or retention of food. Abdominal pain
during evacuation, which is not relieved by it, generally indicates Cold in the
Large Intestine. Abdominal pain after evacuation is normally due to Spleen-Qi
deficiency.
   Case history 31.2 illustrates a pa ern underlying constipation with pain.

               Case History 31.2
         A 22-year-old woman had been suﬀering from constipation
      and abdominal distension and pain for the past 2 years; the
      abdominal pain was alleviated by the bowel movement. Her
      complexion was dull, pale and sallow. She also complained of a
      gradual hair loss on the top of the head, dizziness and itchy skin.
         She had been on the contraceptive pill for a long time, having
      come oﬀ it the previous year; her periods failed to return after
      stopping the contraceptive pill and were only recently beginning
      to return, albeit with an irregular cycle.
     Her tongue was slightly Red on the sides and had a fairly
  thick, sticky yellow coating and her pulse was Slippery and
  slightly Wiry.
     Diagnosis: This case history is reported here mostly as an
  example of the importance of the pulse and tongue in diagnosis.
  In fact, her presenting symptoms clearly reflect Liver-Blood
  deficiency (gradual loss of hair on top, dizziness, dull, sallow
  complexion, itchy skin, irregular periods) and Liver-Qi stagnation
  (abdominal distension and pain). However, the tongue and pulse
  introduce a completely diﬀerent dimension to this case history as
  they clearly reveal the presence of Damp-Heat manifested by the
  redness on the sides of the tongue and sticky yellow coating and
  by the Slippery quality of the pulse (the pulse is also slightly Wiry
  due to Liver-Qi stagnation) (Fig. 31.2 ).
                                                             Oamp-l-l e:at

                    Symptoms                          Liver-Blood deficiency

                                             Tongue
        FIG. 31.2   Determining the importance of the tongue in diagnosis
     The condition of Damp-Heat revealed by the pulse and tongue
  adds to and partially corrects the initial diagnosis: in fact, the
  alleviation of the abdominal pain after the bowel movement
  confirms the presence of Damp-Heat which is a "solid"
  pathogenic factor that is, so to speak, "expelled" by the bowel
  movement. In contrast, abdominal pain due to Liver-Qi stagnation
  does not usually improve with bowel movement.
     The pulse and tongue led me to ask further questions, which I
  would not have otherwise asked, to confirm or exclude the
  presence of Damp-Heat: on questioning she did confirm that the
  abdominal pain was accompanied by a pronounced feeling of
  fullness and heaviness, which are typical of Dampness.
Box 31.5 summarizes pa erns underlying abdominal pain.

      BOX 31.5           ABDOMINAL PAIN
     • Before evacuation: Liver-Qi stagnation
     • During evacuation: Dampness in the Large Intestine or
  retention of food (relieved by it), Cold in the Large Intestine (not
  relieved by it)
     • After evacuation: Spleen-Qi deficiency
     URINE
   Observation , Chapter 20 ; Hearing and Smelling , Chapter 54 ; Symptoms
and Signs, Chapter 73
   With regard to urination we should ask about the following aspects
systematically:

          • frequency
          • colour
          • amount
          • diﬃculty in micturition
          • cloudiness
          • incontinence
          • urination at night
          • pain
          • smell.
   The urination gives a good indication of the Hot or Cold nature of the
condition and also of the state of Kidneys and Bladder.

     Frequency
   As a general principle, enuresis or incontinence of urine is usually due to
Deficiency conditions whereas retention of urine is generally due to a Full
condition, but there are exceptions to this rule. For example, severe Qi deficiency
of the Lungs and Spleen in the elderly may lead to urine retention.
   Frequent urination is generally due to Kidney-Yang deficiency, in which case
the urine is pale and abundant; if it is frequent but scanty it indicates Spleen- and
Kidney-Qi deficiency.
   Nocturnal enuresis in children is due either to a constitutional Kidney
deficiency or to Liver-Fire; in the first instance the child will be quiet and listless,
while in the case of Liver-Fire the child will be vivacious and prone to fits of
anger.

     Colour
   The colour of the urine gives a good indication of the Hot and Cold condition
of the patient. Normal urine is pale yellow. Pale urine indicates Cold in the
Bladder or Kidney-Yang deficiency; dark urine indicates Heat in the Bladder or
Kidney-Yin deficiency. It should be remembered that the colour of the urine is
aﬀected when the person drinks a lot of water (becoming paler than it would
otherwise be) and also when the person takes vitamin B, which makes the urine
bright yellow.
   Blood in the urine indicates either Qi deficiency (of the Spleen and Kidneys),
Heat in the Bladder or Kidney-Yin deficiency.
   Very dark urine, like soya sauce, indicates a kidney disease such as kidney
failure or glomerulonephritis.
   Box 31.6 summarizes pa erns underlying urine colours.

            BOX 31.6       COLOUR OF URINE
            • Pale: Cold in the Bladder or Kidney-Yang deficiency
            • Dark: Heat in the Bladder or Kidney-Yin deficiency
            • Red (with blood): Qi deficiency, Heat in the Bladder or
      Kidney-Yin deficiency

    Amount
   Copious urination indicates Kidney-Yang deficiency; scanty urination
indicates Kidney-Yin deficiency or Heat in the Bladder unless it is due to profuse
sweating, repeated vomiting or severe diarrhoea. If the urination is scanty but
also frequent, it is normally due to Spleen- and Kidney-Qi deficiency. Copious,
clear and pale urination during an exterior invasion of Wind indicates that the
pathogenic factor has not penetrated into the Interior (if it had, the urine would
be dark).

    Difficulty In Micturition
   Retention of urine from Full pa erns may be due to Dampness obstructing
the urinary passages, to Blood stasis in the Bladder or to urinary stones.
Retention of urine from Empty pa erns may be due to Kidney-Yang deficiency,
Kidney-Yin deficiency or a deficiency of the Lungs; all these pa erns occur
mostly in the elderly.
   Diﬃculty in urination (meaning that the micturition is diﬃcult or that it may
stop and start) is usually due to Dampness obstructing the urinary passages; a
slight diﬃculty in urination may also be due to Spleen- and Kidney-Qi
deficiency. In the elderly, it may be due to Kidney-Yang deficiency; in rare cases,
it may be due to Lung-Qi deficiency.

    Cloudiness
   Turbid urine indicates Dampness in the urinary passages. Urine with small
flakes of mucus indicates Damp-Heat in the Bladder.

    Incontinence
   Incontinence of urine is always due to a deficiency of the Kidneys and
sinking of Kidney-Qi; it is common in the elderly and in women after childbirth
or after a hysterectomy.
   Dribbling of urine after urination indicates the Kidney-Qi is not firm.
    Urination At Night
   Urinating at night indicates Kidney-Yang deficiency. This is due to deficient
Yang not controlling Yin at night and therefore fluids leaking out in urination.

         Remember : urination at night is caused by a deficiency of
      Kidney-Yang, rather than Kidney-Yin.

    Pain
   Pain and hypogastric distension before urination indicate Liver-Qi
stagnation; burning pain during urination indicates Damp-Heat in the Bladder; a
dull ache after urination indicates Kidney-Qi deficiency.

    Smell
   Absence of smell is either normal or indicates Cold in the Bladder; a strong
smell indicates Damp-Heat in the Bladder. A sweet smell of the urine may
indicate diabetes.

        THIRST AND DRINK

     CHAPTER CONTENTS
    INTRODUCTION
    THIRST
    DRY MOUTH
    PREFERENCE FOR HOT OR COLD DRINKS
    ABSENCE OF THIRST

     INTRODUCTION

     WHY WE ASK
   The symptom of thirst (or its absence) reflects the state of the Body Fluids.
There are two types of fluid, one called Jin , the other called Ye . The Jin fluids are
clear, light and watery and they circulate with the Defensive Qi in the space
between skin and muscles; sweat comes from these fluids. The Ye fluids are more
dense and heavy and they moisten and lubricate the joint spaces and the sense
organs. Saliva is an expression of these Ye fluids; dryness of the mouth or thirst
(these are not the same thing) are therefore symptoms of deficiency of such
fluids, either because they are burned by Heat or Empty-Heat, or because there
is not enough Yin.
   The organ involved most closely with thirst and dry mouth is the Stomach
but the Kidneys also exert an influence on saliva. However, Heat or Empty-Heat
of any organ may cause thirst or a dry mouth.

     WHEN WE ASK
   During the time I have been practising, I have never had a patient seek
treatment for a problem related to thirst (although in China patients recognize
problems related to thirst as being indicative of an imbalance that needs to be
treated). However, I will ask almost every patient I see whether they feel
particularly thirst, have a dry mouth, etc. I usually do this after I have asked
about food and appetite, or when I am trying to establish the Hot or Cold nature
of a condition.
   I specifically ask about thirst in conditions where a patient has apparent
symptoms of Heat but I suspect does not actually have Heat. For example, in
cases of rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel, a woman may have a feeling of
heat of the face and a red face, but no thirst because there is no actual Heat.

     HOW WE ASK
   For cultural reasons, thirst and dry mouth are two symptoms Chinese
patients are very aware of; whereas Western patients are somewhat less aware of
these symptoms and seldom report them spontaneously. An added diﬃculty in
the West is that more and more people force themselves to drink very frequently
in the mistaken belief that this is a beneficial habit that ‘flushes the kidneys'. As a
result of this habit, such people will seldom feel thirsty even if they suﬀer from
Heat. An added diﬃculty in England is that tea consumption is very high and
this would also stop people from feeling thirsty. The same applies to countries
where coﬀee consumption is high. In the USA, people tend also to drink a lot in
general (including water and soda). As a result of these factors, fewer patients
will report feeling thirsty than is the case in China even though they do suﬀer
from Heat.
   Generally speaking, the preference for hot or cold drinks reflects a condition
of Cold or Heat of the Stomach respectively. However, this diagnostic symptom
may be rendered invalid by cultural habits in Western countries and especially in
the USA, where the consumption of iced drinks is very widespread.

     THIRST
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 70
   Generally speaking, thirst indicates Heat, which may be either Full- or
Empty-Heat. Thirst is not the same as dry mouth, as the former usually reflects
Heat whereas the la er reflects Yin deficiency.
   Full-Heat causes intense thirst with desire to drink cold fluids. Full Heat of
any organ can cause this symptom, but especially Stomach-Heat, Lung-Heat,
Liver-Fire and Heart-Fire.
   Empty-Heat causes thirst with desire to drink in small sips, especially in the
evening or during the night. This symptom is caused particularly by Empty-
Heat of the Stomach, Lungs, Kidneys and Heart.
   A particular symptom in Chinese diagnosis is that of ‘thirst without desire to
drink'. This particular symptom may seem strange but it does occur and Western
patients do occasionally report it even spontaneously. Damp-Heat causes thirst
but without the desire to drink; this is because Heat causes the thirst but
Dampness, obstructing the Middle Burner, makes the patient reluctant to drink.
   Thirst with a desire to drink but immediately followed by the vomiting of
fluids indicates Phlegm-Heat.
     In rare cases, a mild thirst with a desire to sip fluids may be due to severe,
chronic Qi deficiency; this is due to the deficient Qi not transporting the fluids to
the mouth and causing thirst.
     Intense thirst with profuse urination may indicate diabetes (Case history 32.1
).

                Case History 32.1
           A 50-year-old woman had been suﬀering from type-II, late-
       onset diabetes which had been diagnosed only 7 weeks before.
       The first manifestations of it were thirst, frequent urination,
       vaginal itching and irritation and extreme tiredness. The onset of
       the diabetes coincided with the stopping of her periods, during
       which time she suﬀered from hot flushes, night sweating,
       urination at night, disturbed sleep, dry eyes and throat at night
       with desire to sip water and what she described as ‘a feeling of
       adrenaline rushing up and around the chest'. She was overweight,
       her voice was quite loud and she was generally lively. Her
       complexion was quite flushed.
           Diagnosis: The red complexion and the symptoms she
       developed after the stoppage of her periods clearly indicate Heat
       or Empty-Heat. However, this case is an example of a striking
       contradiction between the symptoms and the tongue: in fact, her
       tongue was Pale and Swollen. In order to confirm or exclude the
       presence of Cold or Yang deficiency as manifested by the tongue, I
       asked about cold feeling and she did confirm that, although she
       felt hot at night, she also experienced very cold feet and needed to
       wear socks in bed. This contradiction is very common especially
       in women of menopausal age and it simply indicates that there is
       a deficiency of both Kidney-Yin and Kidney-Yang. The deficiency
       of the Kidneys was also confirmed by the fact that she suﬀered
       from chronic lower backache; the symptom of frequent urination
       experienced with the onset of her diabetes also confirms the
       Kidney deficiency and it is not by chance that the diabetes
       developed when her periods stopped and the Kidney energy
       declined.
           Her pulse was Deep, slightly Slippery, Weak on both Rear
       positions and relatively Overflowing on the Heart position. The
       Deep and Weak pulse on both Rear positions confirms the Kidney
       deficiency, while the Slippery quality indicates the presence of
       Phlegm which is confirmed by her being overweight. The
       relatively Overflowing quality of the Heart pulse is common in
       menopausal women and, rather than indicating an actual Heart
       pa ern, it reflects a rising of Qi towards the top of the body due to
      the deficiency of the Kidneys below. It is this rising of Qi that
      causes the hot flushes and in her case, also the peculiar symptom
      of ‘a feeling of adrenaline rushing up and around the chest'.
          The treatment principle in this case is to tonify the Kidneys,
      strengthen the Penetrating and Directing Vessels, tonify the
      Spleen and resolve Phlegm.

     DRY MOUTH
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 70
   Yin deficiency causes a dry mouth, rather than thirst, especially in the
afternoon or evening; also in this case the patient likes to drink in small sips.
   Although not common, a dry mouth may also be due to severe, chronic Blood
stasis, in which case there would also be a desire to gargle with fluids without
swallowing.

          A dry mouth may be caused by Yin deficiency, rather than
      Heat. In this case, it would get worse in the afternoon and
      evening.

     PREFERENCE FOR HOT OR COLD
DRINKS
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 70
   A patient's preference for hot or cold drinks reflects the Cold or Hot nature of
their condition, especially with regard to the Stomach. Stomach-Cold will cause
a patient to prefer warm drinks, while Stomach-Heat will cause a patient to
desire cold drinks.
   A desire to drink warm or hot liquids does not count as ‘thirst' and it
indicates a Cold pa ern of the Stomach, which may include also Cold-
Dampness.

     ABSENCE OF THIRST
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 70
   Although ‘absence of thirst' is not a symptom as such, it is considered in
Chinese medicine because it has a particular diagnostic significance. Absence of
thirst, that is, if the patient feels seldom thirsty and never has the desire to drink,
indicates a Cold pa ern. Obviously, this symptom is elicited on interrogation as
a patient will not normally report it spontaneously.
   Box 32.1 summarizes the pa erns underlying thirst.

        ENERGY LEVELS

    CHAPTER CONTENTS
    INTRODUCTION
    HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
    PATTERNS CAUSING TIREDNESS

    INTRODUCTION
   This is not one of the traditional 10 questions of Chinese diagnosis. I have
added it to the list of questions because tiredness is one of the most common
symptoms reported by Western patients. In my practice, about 12% of patients
seek treatment specifically and only for tiredness; and to these should be added
all the other patients who come for other symptoms or diseases but who also
suﬀer from chronic tiredness.

    WHY WE ASK
   It is always essential to ask about level of energy and tiredness because it is
such a common complaint: indeed, it is often the main reason that patients seek
treatment.

    WHEN WE ASK
   I generally ask about tiredness quite early during the interrogation and as
soon as I suspect a Deficiency pa ern.

    HOW WE ASK
   This is generally quite straightforward and I usually ask whether they ‘feel
unusually tired' or whether they ‘lack energy'. However, when enquiring about
tiredness, it is very important to enquire about the patient's lifestyle. Many
people have unrealistic expectations about their level of energy. If people in
industrialized societies work too much and for far too long, a feeling of tiredness
is entirely normal. For example, it is not uncommon for someone to get up at 6
am, leave home at 6.30 to catch a train, work the whole day under hectic
conditions (having a sandwich at the desk for ‘lunch') and return home at 9 in
the evening; such a schedule is precisely what constitutes ‘overwork' in Chinese
medicine.
   Our level of energy depends also on age. Again, very many people have
unrealistic expectations about their desired level of energy and are surprised that
they cannot do at 55 what they did when they were 25.

     HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
   There is no Chinese disease-symptom category called ‘tiredness' but there is
one called ‘exhaustion' (Xu Lao or Xu Sun ). The term Xu Lao describes not only a
symptom, that is, ‘tiredness' (Lao ) but also its pathology, that is, a deficiency of
the body's Qi (xu ). The term Xu Lao was introduced in the ‘Prescriptions from
the Golden Cabinet' for the first time. It says in Chapter 6 : ‘ When the pulse is
big but empty in male patients, it indicates extreme exhaustion from over-
exertion .' 1
   The ‘Discussion on the Causes and Symptoms of Diseases' (Zhu Bing Yuan
Hou Lun , AD 610) by Chao Yuan Fang elaborates on the concept of exhaustion by
investigating its causes. Dr Chao considers exhaustion to be due to the ‘6
Excesses' (overexertion leading to depletion of Qi, Blood, Sinews, Bones, Muscles
and Essence) and the ‘7 Injuries'. The ‘7 Injuries' refer to the damage inflicted on
the Internal Organs by various excesses such as:

           • overeating injuring the Spleen
           • prolonged anger injuring the Liver
           • lifting excessive weights or si ing on damp ground injuring
       the Kidneys
           • exposure to cold and drinking cold liquids injuring the
       Lungs
           • exposure to wind, rain, cold and heat injuring the body
           • fear, anxiety and shock injuring the Mind. 2
   The ‘Simple Questions' in Chapter 23 lists five causes of exhaustion:

           • excessive use of the eyes injuring the Heart
           • excessive lying down injuring the Lungs
           • excessive si ing injuring the Spleen
           • excessive standing injuring the Kidneys
           • excessive exercise injuring the Liver. 3
   Over the centuries various doctors discussed the treatment of exhaustion
according to their particular views and emphases. For example, Li Dong Yuan,
author of the famous ‘Discussion on Stomach and Spleen' (Pi Wei Lun , 1249), 4
considered Stomach and Spleen deficiency to be the main cause of exhaustion.
Zhu Dan Xi, author of ‘Secrets of Dan Xi' (Dan Xi Xin Fa , 1347), 5 placed the
emphasis on Kidney- and Liver-Yin deficiency as a cause of exhaustion and
advocated nourishing Yin and clearing Heat. Zhang Jie Bin, author of the ‘Classic
of Categories' (Lei Jing , 1624) 6 and the ‘Complete Book of Jing Yue' (Jing Yue
Quan Shu , 1624), 7 advocated tonifying the Kidneys for the treatment of
exhaustion.
   Zhu Qi Shi (1463-1539) considered the Lungs, Spleen and Kidneys to be the
three most important organs to treat in exhaustion. He said in his book
‘Discussion on Exhaustion' (Xu Lao Lun ): ‘To treat Exhaustion there are three
roots: Lungs, Spleen and Kidneys. Lungs are like the "heaven" of the internal
organs, the Spleen is like the "mother" of the body and the Kidneys are like the
"root" of life. Treat these three organs to treat Exhaustion .' 8 Dr Zhu indicated
the Spleen and Lungs as the two main organs to treat in cases of chronic
tiredness, the Spleen for Yang deficiency and the Lungs for Yin deficiency. Each
of these can eventually lead to Kidney-Yang or Kidney-Yin deficiency and Yang
deficiency can lead to Yin deficiency, or vice versa. Dr Zhu says: ‘To treat
Deficiency there are two interconnected systems: either the Lungs or the Spleen.
Every [Deficiency] disease boils down to Yang or Yin deficiency. Yang deficiency
can lead to Yin deficiency after a prolonged time. Yin deficiency can lead to Yang
deficiency after a prolonged time. In Yang deficiency treat the Spleen, in Yin
deficiency treat the Lungs. ' 9
   Thus, tiredness is included in the concept of exhaustion, although the la er is
a more serious condition than simple tiredness. However, although exhaustion
contemplates only Deficiency causes, tiredness may also be due to Full causes;
Dampness, Phlegm and Qi stagnation are common causes of tiredness.

     PATTERNS CAUSING TIREDNESS
   A chronic feeling of tiredness is usually due to Deficiency. This may be Qi,
Yang, Blood or Yin deficiency. In some cases, tiredness may also be due to a Full
condition, and especially Dampness, Phlegm or Qi stagnation.
   The pulse is an important sign to diﬀerentiate Full from Empty types of
tiredness: if the pulse is Full in general (often Slippery or Wiry) it indicates that
the tiredness is caused by a Full condition (usually Dampness, Phlegm or Qi
stagnation).

          Remember : tiredness is not always due to a condition of
      Deficiency . It can be, and it often is, due to a Full condition.
   Dampness and Phlegm are ‘heavy' and weigh down the body so that the
person feels heavy and tired. Qi stagnation may also make a person feel tired;
this is not because there is not enough Qi but because, being stagnant, Qi does
not circulate properly. This situation is more common in men and it often reflects
a state of mental depression. The classic example would be that of a man who
seeks treatment primarily for tiredness and whose pulse and tongue reveal no
Deficiency at all but only severe Qi stagnation, the pulse being very Wiry and
Full on all positions and the tongue being Red on the sides. In such a situation
the man feels tired from Qi stagnation and his tiredness is closely linked to a
state of mental depression (itself often deriving from repressed anger).
   Chronic tiredness associated with a desire to lie down, poor appetite and
loose stools indicates Spleen-Qi deficiency, which is probably the most common
cause of it; if there are Cold symptoms, it is due to Spleen-Yang deficiency.
   Chronic tiredness associated with a weak voice and a propensity to catching
colds indicates Lung-Qi deficiency; if there are Cold symptoms, it is due to
Lung-Yang deficiency.
   Chronic tiredness associated with backache, lassitude, a feeling of cold,
depression and frequent urination indicates Kidney-Yang deficiency.
   Chronic tiredness associated with slight depression, dizziness and scanty
periods indicates Liver-Blood deficiency.
   Chronic tiredness associated with anxiety, insomnia, a dry mouth at night
and a tongue without coating is due to Kidney-Yin deficiency.
   Chronic tiredness associated with a feeling of heaviness of the body and
muzziness of the head indicates retention of Dampness.
   Chronic tiredness associated with a feeling of oppression of the chest,
dizziness and muzziness of the head indicates retention of Phlegm.
   Chronic tiredness in an anxious and tense person with a Wiry pulse indicates
stagnation of Liver-Qi.
   Short-term tiredness with alternating cold and hot feeling, irritability,
unilateral tongue coating and a Wiry pulse indicates the Lesser-Yang pa ern
(either of the Six Stages or of the Four Levels).
   Case histories 33.1 -33.7 illustrate diﬀerent pa erns causing tiredness.

               Case History 33.1
          A 56-year-old woman complained of extreme tiredness for the
      past 3 years since the death of her husband. She said her legs ‘felt
      like lead' and had no motivation to do all the things that needed
      to be done in the house. She had also been suﬀering from
      insomnia, also since her husband's death. She said ‘I feel pain
      inside but the tears don't come'. As she is stoically trying to live
      through her pain without crying, her grief and depression is
      probably somatized more, causing more physical symptoms.
          Apart from these main two problems she presented with, she
      had also been suﬀering from occipital headaches since the birth of
      her second child 26 years before. On interrogation, it transpired
      that she also experienced dizziness, hot flushes, urination at night
      and abdominal distension and heaviness.
          Her tongue was slightly Red, Stiﬀ, dry, with a sticky coating
      and a Heart crack; her pulse was Slippery on the right, Floating-
      Empty on the left and Weak and Deep on the left Rear position.
   Diagnosis: This is a complex combination of pa erns. The
overwhelming factor is, however, the obvious grief and
depression following the death of her husband; the symptom she
first complained of was ‘tiredness' but, as she went on talking, it
was obvious that this was due to a deep depression following the
grief caused by her husband's death: hence the lack of motivation
and insomnia.
   From the point of view of pa erns, there is obviously a
deficiency of Kidney-Yin evidenced by the urination at night, the
headaches stemming from the second birth, the dizziness, the hot
flushes, the Red, Stiﬀ and dry tongue, the Floating-Empty quality
of the pulse on the left and Weak-Deep Kidney pulse on the left.
Accompanying the Kidney-Yin deficiency there is also Heart-Yin
deficiency causing the insomnia and manifesting with the deep
Heart crack. In addition to these conditions, there is also some
Dampness evidenced by the abdominal distension and heaviness
and by the sticky tongue coating.

        Case History 33.2
   An 18-year-old girl had been suﬀering from tiredness and
lassitude for the previous 9 months: this came on gradually and
was also accompanied by recurrent sore throats, temporal
headaches, a feeling of heaviness, dizziness, a feeling of
muzziness of the head, blurred vision, phlegm in the throat and
an alternation of hot and cold feeling.
   Her tongue was slightly Red on the sides, with red points on
the right side and her pulse was generally Wiry.
   Diagnosis: This is a very clear example of the Lesser-Yang
pa ern, not from the Six Stages, but from the Qi level of the Four
Levels (called ‘Gall-Bladder Heat'). The Gall-Bladder Heat pa ern
from the Four Levels diﬀers from the Lesser-Yang pa ern of the
Six Stages in so far as it is characterized by more Heat than Cold
and by the presence of Phlegm. This patient's symptoms clearly
confirm this as the red points on the right side of the tongue
indicate that there is more Heat, while the feeling of heaviness, the
feeling of muzziness of the head and the phlegm in the throat
indicate the presence of Phlegm.
   This is also a good example of tiredness caused not by
Deficiency, but by Heat.

        Case History 33.3
   A 54-year-old man complained of chronic tiredness and
lassitude; this was his main presenting complaint. During the
interrogation very few other symptoms emerged: in fact the only
other symptom of note was the presence of loose stools. There
were no other symptoms of Spleen deficiency, nor of Kidney
deficiency. This patient looked very quiet and subdued, spoke
with a very low voice and walked rather slowly; his facial
complexion was quite red.
   His tongue was Reddish-Purple in general, and especially on
the right side and had a Red tip. His pulse was Wiry in general.
   Diagnosis: This is an example of a situation when the
demeanour of the patient contradicts the pulse and tongue. His
slow walk, low voice and quiet demeanour all indicate Deficiency,
while the tongue and pulse clearly indicate the presence of a Full
condition. This is also an example when, in the absence of many
symptoms, the tongue and pulse become even more important
than usual. His tongue indicates Liver-Blood stasis (because it is
more Purple on the right side) and his pulse confirms this. Liver-
Blood stasis nearly always develops from chronic Liver-Qi
stagnation and we can therefore assume that this patient has been
suﬀering from Liver-Qi stagnation for a long time. The most
common cause of Liver-Qi stagnation is an emotional problem
related to anger, resentment or frustration. In this case, therefore,
the chronic tiredness is due, not to a Deficiency, but to a Fullness;
the symptom of loose stools, which normally indicates Spleen-Qi
deficiency, may be here due to stagnant Liver-Qi invading the
Spleen. Thus, although this patient complains primarily of
tiredness, it is obvious that he also suﬀers from mental
depression.

        Case History 33.4
   A 39-year-old man had been suﬀering from extreme tiredness
for many years; the tiredness was accompanied by a feeling of
weakness of the limbs and was worse in the morning. When asked
whether the tiredness was accompanied by a feeling of heaviness,
he said that it was, but only during an acute respiratory infection.
He was also prone to frequent colds and upper respiratory
infections which aﬀected his sinuses every time, causing a
congested feeling in the face and a sticky nasal discharge. Ten
years previously he had been experiencing very poor digestion
and frequent bouts of diarrhoea; he had been diagnosed as
suﬀering from coeliac disease (from which his father also
suﬀered) and he improved considerably by avoiding gluten.
However, he still suﬀered from an alternation of bouts of loose
stools and constipation. On interrogation it transpired that his
mouth and lips were frequently dry.
   His body type clearly belonged to the Wood element, being
tall and thin, but he walked in a slow and slightly awkward way
which did not fit in with the Wood body type. He looked fairly
relaxed and placid and he spoke slowly and with a soft voice. His
complexion was dull-pale yellow but his eyelids, especially the
upper ones, were rather red.
   His tongue was Red on the sides in the Spleen area, Swollen
and had a yellow coating. His pulse was generally Slippery.
   Diagnosis: There are clear manifestations of Spleen-Qi
deficiency, that is, the tiredness, the feeling of weakness, being
prone to frequent colds, the tendency to loose stools and the dull-
pale-yellow complexion; the history of coeliac disease (aﬀecting
his father as well) indicates that he most probably suﬀered from a
constitutional Spleen deficiency. The Spleen deficiency had
obviously given rise to Dampness which is manifesting with the
sinus congestion, the feeling of heaviness during acute infections
and the Slippery pulse.
   There is a third, rather uncommon pa ern and that is Spleen-
Heat which is causing the tendency to constipation, the dry
mouth, dry lips and manifests on the tongue with a Red colour on
the sides in the Spleen areas and a yellow coating.
   The contrast between his body type, which pertains to Wood,
and his prevailing disharmony in the Earth element is a poor
prognostic sign; that is, it is be er for a Wood type to suﬀer from a
Wood disharmony.

        Case History 33.5
   A 49-year-old man had been suﬀering from tiredness and
palpitations for the past 18 months. He also complained of
irritability and said that all his symptoms became worse in the
afternoon.
   In the few weeks before the consultation, he had developed a
burning sensation on urination. This was a recurrence of a
symptom that he had suﬀered from previously.
   His tongue was Swollen and the sides were Red. His pulse was
Wiry and Slow.
   Diagnosis: In this case, the overall Wiry nature of the pulse
points towards the fact that the tiredness is caused by Liver-Qi
stagnation rather than Deficiency. Liver-Qi stagnation is also, of
course, the reason that the patient often feels irritable. The
stagnation has led to some Heat, which is shown on the Red sides
of the tongue, and is causing the burning sensation on urination.
The Slow quality of the pulse may seem to contradict the
symptoms of Heat, but it is due to the long-standing stagnation of
Liver-Qi.

          Case History 33.6
   A 13-year-old boy had been suﬀering from headaches, night
sweating, weakness and tiredness for 3 weeks. These symptoms
had an acute onset in springtime and his health and energy before
that were good. On closer questioning, his weakness consisted
mostly of a feeling of weary limbs and he also complained of an
epigastric discomfort which he found diﬃcult to describe; he said
that it was like ‘a feeling of hunger' and could not decide whether
it was hunger or pain. This was also accompanied by a feeling of
nausea. In addition, he also experienced ache in the joints,
especially of the legs, dizziness, restless sleep and irritability.
   His tongue was very slightly Red on the sides and had a
sticky-white coating. His pulse was Slippery-Wiry-Rapid (92
b.p.m).
   Diagnosis: The essential feature of this boy's condition is its
acute onset. If we analyse his symptoms in isolation, many
diﬀerent pa erns would emerge: Damp-Heat in the joints (ache in
the joints), Liver-Yang rising (headaches, irritability, dizziness),
Yin deficiency (night sweating, epigastric discomfort with feeling
of hunger), Spleen-Qi deficiency (weakness, tiredness, weary
limbs) and Stomach-Qi not descending (nausea). However, if we
take the sudden onset into account and consider the symptoms in
their totality, it then becomes apparent that this problem is caused
by the emergence of Latent Heat in springtime. In this particular
case, Latent Heat manifests as Damp-Heat.
   Latent Heat occurs when an external pathogenic factor invades
the body (in theory in winter but it can happen in any season)
without causing apparent symptoms at the time; the pathogenic
factor goes into the Interior, turns into Heat and ‘lurks' in the
Interior to emerge later with a sudden onset in springtime. When
it emerges, Latent Heat manifests with symptoms of Interior Heat
but with an acute onset; in this boy's case the symptoms of Heat
are insomnia, restless sleep, irritability, night sweating, feeling of
hunger, Red sides of the tongue and Rapid pulse. The symptoms
of Damp-Heat are weary limbs, ache in the joints, sticky tongue
coating and a Slippery pulse.
     Although the symptoms appear quite complex, the treatment
  is relatively simple and it should consist in clearing Heat and
  resolving Damp with a prescription such as Lian Po Yin Coptis-
  Magnolia Decoction .

           Case History 33.7
     A 20-year-old woman had been suﬀering from postviral
  fatigue syndrome for 3 years. Her symptoms were extreme
  fatigue, swollen glands, a mild, intermi ent sore throat, a feeling
  of tightness of the chest, ache in the muscles, a feeling of
  muzziness of the head, dizziness, a feeling of heaviness, an
  alternating feeling of heat and cold, headaches on the temples,
  blurred vision, tinnitus, thirst, a sticky taste, loose stools and fits
  of crying. She suﬀered an acute and severe a ack of glandular
  fever (mononucleosis) when she was 16, which confined her to
  bed for a long time. On further questioning, she also said that she
  felt ‘a pulsation' in the chest and epigastrium and that she
  suﬀered from insomnia.
     Her tongue was Red in general and slightly Swollen with a
  sticky coating, and her pulse was Slippery and Rapid (92).
     Diagnosis: There are two main pa erns emerging from the
  numerous symptoms and signs: the first is residual Damp-Heat
  following the original acute a ack of glandular fever and the
  second is the pa ern of Gall-Bladder Heat of the Qi level within
  the identification of pa erns according to the Four Levels. The
  Gall-Bladder Heat pa ern of the Qi level is equivalent to the
  Lesser-Yang pa ern of the Six Stages, the main diﬀerence being
  that it is characterized by more Heat.
     The symptoms and signs of Damp-Heat are extreme fatigue,
  swollen glands, ache in the muscles, intermi ent sore throat,
  feeling of muzziness, feeling of heaviness, sticky taste, thirst, loose
  stools, a feeling of pulsation in the chest and epigastrium,
  insomnia, Swollen and Red tongue with sticky coating, Slippery-
  Rapid pulse. Some of these symptoms are related to the actual
  Dampness and some to Heat. The symptoms and signs of the
  Gall-Bladder Heat pa ern are alternation of feeling of heat and
  cold, headaches on the temples, dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus,
  insomnia and a Rapid pulse.
Box 33.1 summarizes pa erns underlying tiredness.

    INTRODUCTION
   The head is called the ‘Fu of the Bright Essence' because it houses the Brain, which
is a manifestation of the Sea of Marrow and Marrow itself is a manifestation of
Essence; as the Essence is stored in the Kidneys, the head is also under the influence of
the Kidneys. The hair on the head is nourished by the Kidneys and Qi and Blood in
general and for this reason the hair was said to be the ‘abundance of Blood' and the
‘glory of the Kidneys'. The head is also called the ‘Meeting of all Yang' because all the
Yang channels meet in the head where they either end or begin. The head also houses
the senses and the Yang channels bring to it clear Yang-Qi, which ‘brightens' the
senses' orifices and enables a person to have clear sight, hearing, taste and smell.

    WHY WE ASK
   It is important to ask about any problems in the head with practically every
patient, first because headache and dizziness are such common complaints and
secondly because patients may often forget about some head symptoms unless they
are asked. For example, not many patients would volunteer the information of having
an itchy scalp or a feeling of heaviness of the head. Problems related to the head often
serve to confirm or exclude the presence of Liver pa erns (although of course not
exclusively Liver pa erns). For example, the symptoms of itchiness of the scalp in a
patient presenting with a possible Liver disharmony would confirm such disharmony
as it may be due to Liver-Blood deficiency, Wind in the skin (also Liver related), Liver-
Fire or Damp-Heat in the Liver channel.

     WHEN WE ASK
   Questions about the head are obviously particularly important in patients who
suﬀer from headaches; however, they are also important in the elderly and in those
suﬀering from hypertension or tinnitus. In the elderly they have particular importance
because head symptoms such as headache, dizziness, feeling of distension of the head,
etc. often occur with serious pathologies such as hypertension or may be prodromal
signs of Wind-stroke.
   I also ask about head symptoms whenever there is Liver-Qi stagnation or Liver-
Blood stasis to check whether there may be also Liver-Yang rising or Liver-Fire, which
tend to cause symptoms in the head. For example, a woman may complain of
premenstrual tension characterized by irritability and breast distension. She may also
suﬀer from premenstrual headaches but may not relate them to the premenstrual
phase. The presence of headaches would confirm that there is Liver-Yang rising in
conjunction with Liver-Qi stagnation; if we did not ask about the headache, we would
never know this. This situation arises especially in Liver disharmonies because in such
disharmonies it is common for a patient to suﬀer from two, three, or even four
concomitant Liver pa erns.

     HOW WE ASK
   I usually ask about any head symptoms whenever this is appropriate during the
interrogation.
   I especially ask about head symptoms whenever a Liver disharmony emerges to
check whether there may be Liver-Yang rising or Liver-Fire.

     HEADACHE
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 55
   Headache is one of the most common presenting symptoms in Western patients;
Chinese books diﬀerentiate first of all between headaches of internal origin and those
of external origin, but the la er are not frequently seen in practice.
   When asking a patient about headaches it is important to ask systematically about
onset, time, location, character of pain and ameliorating or aggravating factors.
    Onset
   A recent onset and short duration indicate headache from exterior invasion of
Wind; a gradual onset with long duration indicates headache from interior causes.

    Time
   Headache occurring in the daytime usually indicates Qi or Yang deficiency,
whereas headache occurring in the evening may be due to Blood or Yin deficiency.
Headache starting at night during sleep indicates Blood stasis.

    Location

         • Occiput: here the location is the Greater-Yang channels (the
      headache can be from exterior invasion of Wind-Cold if the pain is
      severe or from interior Kidney deficiency if the pain is dull) (Fig. 34.1 ).

            FIG. 34.1   Location of occipital and vertical headache
         • Vertex: here the location is the terminal Yin channels (the
      headache is usually from deficiency of Liver-Blood) (Fig. 34.1 ).
         • Forehead: here the location is the Bright-Yang channels (the
      headache can be from Stomach-Heat or Blood deficiency) (Fig. 34.2 ).

            FIG. 34.2   Location of frontal headache
         • Temples and sides of the head: here the location is Lesser-Yang
      channels (the headache can be from exterior Wind in the Lesser-Yang or
      from Liver-Yang rising) (Fig. 34.3 ).

            FIG. 34.3   Location of Lesser-Yang headache
            • Temple, side of head and eye: here the location is the Lesser-Yang
        channels (the headache is usually from Liver- Yang rising) (Fig. 34.4 ).

               FIG. 34.4   Location of Liver-Yang rising headache
            • Behind the eyes: here the location is the Liver channel (the
        headache cause is either Liver-Yang rising or Liver-Blood deficiency)
        (Fig. 34.5 ).

               FIG. 34.5   Location of headache behind the eyes
            • Whole head: this is caused by exterior invasion of Wind-Heat or
        Kidney deficiency.

     Character Of Pain
   A dull ache usually indicates Deficiency whereas an intense, sharp pain usually
indicates Excess. A throbbing and distending pain indicates Liver-Yang rising, a
pulling pain indicates Liver-Wind and a fixed, boring pain indicates Blood stasis. A
dull ache, with the head feeling as if it were wrapped in or full of co on wool, and a
sensation of heaviness indicate Dampness or Phlegm. Headache that is experienced
‘inside' the head is usually due to a Kidney deficiency (see below).

     Ameliorating Or Aggravating Factors
   Chronic headaches that are improved by rest are due to Deficiency, whereas if they
are improved by exercise they are due to Liver-Fire, Phlegm or Blood stasis.
Headaches aggravated by lying down usually indicate Fullness (Liver-Yang rising,
Liver-Fire, Phlegm or Blood stasis). If they are ameliorated by lying down they usually
indicate Deficiency.
   Headaches that are improved by eating usually indicate Deficiency; if they are
aggravated by eating they usually indicate Excess, especially Phlegm or retention of
food.

     Internal And Exterior Origin
   The diﬀerentiation of headaches is best done by distinguishing headaches of
interior origin from those of exterior origin.
     Headaches of internal origin
   In headaches of internal origin, it is very important to diﬀerentiate between those
deriving from Fullness and those deriving from Emptiness. The most common
headaches from Fullness include Liver-Yang rising, Liver-Fire, Phlegm, Blood stasis,
Liver-Wind, Stomach-Heat and retention of food; the most common headaches from
Emptiness include Blood deficiency, Stomach- and Spleen-Qi deficiency and Kidney
deficiency.
   The headache from Liver-Yang rising manifests with a throbbing pain, which is
usually unilateral, often moving from side to side and located behind the eye, on the
temples or on the lateral side of the head along the Gall-Bladder channel. It is often
accompanied by nausea and vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision, flashing lights and a
Wiry pulse.
   The headache from Liver-Fire, which is less common, is similar in character to that
from Liver-Yang rising but it is accompanied by Liver-Fire symptoms and signs such
as intense thirst, bi er taste, red face, dark urine and dry stools.
   Another very common type of headache is that from Phlegm obstructing the clear
orifices of the head: in this case the headache is dull in nature and the head feels as if it
were wrapped in or full of co on wool and with a pronounced feeling of heaviness,
muzziness and blurred vision. Other manifestations include a feeling of nausea, a
feeling of oppression of the chest, a Swollen tongue and a Slippery pulse.
   A very common type of chronic headache is the one due to a combination of
Phlegm and internal Wind. Such a headache has all the characteristics as the one from
Phlegm but is characterized by occasional bouts of severe headaches from Wind. Such
a pa ern is called ‘Wind-Phlegm'. However, Phlegm as a cause of headache is
frequently also associated with Liver-Yang rising, with the Phlegm being carried
upwards by the ascending Liver-Yang; a person suﬀering from these two pa erns will
suﬀer from chronic, dull headaches with a feeling of muzziness and dizzines (caused
by Phlegm) punctuated by occasional, acute a acks of severe, throbbing headaches
(caused by Liver-Yang rising). Such pa ern is also called ‘Wind-Phlegm'.
   The headache from Blood stasis is characterized by an intense, fixed, boring pain,
usually unilateral, and accompanied by a Purple tongue and Wiry pulse. In very
chronic, long-standing cases of headache, the Blood stasis type of pain may often be
combined with other types; the chronic recurrence of a headache in the same part of
the head may by itself cause local Blood stasis. For example, if a patient suﬀers from a
Liver-Yang type of headache for many years occurring always on the right side, this
may by itself cause a local stasis of Blood in the head on that side and thus the
headache will manifest with symptoms of both Liver-Yang rising and Blood stasis.
   The headache from Liver-Wind is characterized by a pulling pain, accompanied by
severe dizziness and tremors.
   The headache from Stomach-Heat is characterized by an intense frontal pain and is
accompanied by epigastric pain, thirst, sour regurgitation and a yellow tongue
coating.
   The headache from retention of food is charac-terized by a diﬀused and intense
dull pain on the forehead and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sour
regurgitation, a feeling of fullness of the epigastrium, a thick and sticky tongue
coating and a Slippery pulse.
   The headache from Blood deficiency (usually of the Liver or Heart, or both) is
characterized by a dull ache, usually on the top of the head, and is accompanied by
dizziness, blurred vision, insomnia, palpitations, a Pale tongue and a Choppy pulse.
   The headache from Stomach- and Spleen-Qi deficiency is characterized by a dull
frontal ache and is accompanied by tiredness, lassitude, weak limbs, loose stools, poor
appetite, a Pale tongue and a Weak pulse.
   The headache from Kidney deficiency (which could be Yin or Yang deficiency) is
characterized by a dull headache all over the head, accompanied by a feeling of
emptiness of the head, dizziness and tinnitus.
   Stagnation of Cold in the Liver channel may cause a dull but intense, vertical
headache associated with cold feet. However, this headache is rather rare.

    Headaches of external origin
   External headaches are due to invasion of Wind-Cold, Wind-Heat and Wind-
Dampness and they all obviously have an acute onset.
   The headache from Wind-Cold is characterized by a severe occipital ache and
stiﬀness and is accompanied by pronounced aversion to cold, fever, sneezing and a
Floating-Tight pulse.
   The headache from Wind-Heat is characterized by a severe pain as if the head were
being cracked open and is accompanied by aversion to cold, fever, sore throat, slight
sweating and a Floating-Rapid pulse.
   The headache from Wind-Dampness is characterized by a dull headache as if the
head were wrapped up and is accompanied by a feeling of heaviness of the head,
aversion to cold, fever, slight sweating, nausea and a Floating-Slippery pulse.
   Figure 34.6 is a classification of headaches.

      FIG. 34.6     Classification of headaches
   Case histories 34.1 -34.5 illustrate some diﬀerent pa erns causing headache.

                    Case History 34.1
           A 14-year-old girl had been suﬀering from recurring headaches
      since the age of 10 years. The headaches were severe and came
      approximately every 3 months. The headache was concentrated in the
      area behind the eyes, was throbbing in character and was accompanied
      by blurred vision, vomiting, and what she described as ‘fuzzy eyes'.
Apart from the a acks of severe headaches every 3 months, she also
experienced frequent, dull headaches in between.
   On interrogation, she said she suﬀered from chronic tiredness and
experienced some tingling of her limbs.
   Her tongue was Pale, slightly Swollen and with a sticky coating; her
pulse was slightly Slippery.
   Diagnosis: The headaches are very clearly of the Liver-Yang type:
this is confirmed by the throbbing character of the pain, the location
behind the eyes and the vomiting. However, there are two other
pa erns which are evidenced by very few symptoms. First of all, there
is some Liver-Blood deficiency, which is indicated by the chronic
tiredness, the Pale tongue and the tingling; Liver-Blood deficiency is
obviously the cause for the rising of Liver-Yang in this case. Secondly,
there is also some Phlegm; this is evidenced mostly by the tongue
(being Swollen and with a sticky coating) and pulse (being Slippery).
The ‘fuzzy eyes' could also be interpreted as a sign of Phlegm
obstructing the eye orifices.
   This is a good example of the importance of tongue and pulse as
pointers to a certain pa ern even in the absence of symptoms; for this
reason, tongue and pulse pictures should never be discounted when
they do not appear to accord with the presenting symptoms. For
example, in this case of Liver-Blood deficiency with Liver-Yang rising,
the tongue ‘should' have been Pale and Thin and the pulse might have
been Wiry on the left and Weak on the right. Why should the tongue
and pulse show a certain pa ern and the patient not show any signs of
it? This often happens in young people when there is a certain
pathogenic factor (in this case Phlegm) but, due to the young age of the
person, it has not given rise to clinical manifestations as yet.
   The treatment principle in this case should therefore be not only to
nourish Liver-Blood and subdue Liver-Yang but also to resolve Phlegm.

         Case History 34.2
   A 28-year-old woman had been suﬀering from migraine since the
age of 13. She was thin, quite tall and she walked with agility: her body
shape was a typical Wood type (see Chapter 1 ). Her complexion was
dull sallow, her hair was dry and her eyes had good shen .
   The headaches were of a throbbing character and always occurred
on the left side of the head, along the Gall-Bladder channel and behind
the left eye; they occurred weekly and they were nearly always
accompanied by nausea, vomiting and photophobia. The headache was
not aﬀected by posture or food intake and, although a headache always
occurred with her period, she also suﬀered from headaches at other
times. The headaches were aggravated by damp and windy weather
and also by stress and fatigue. A striking feature of the headaches was
that they were markedly be er during two pregnancies and markedly
worse soon after childbirth both times. She had two children, one 3
years old and one 6 months old. An EEG and CT scan revealed no
abnormalities and drugs for migraine produced an aggravation.
   The periods were quite normal, coming regularly, with normal
amount and colour but rather painful on the first 2 days. Her general
health was good with no abnormalities in urination or defecation or
sleep.
   Diagnosis: Observation of her body type indicates that she is a
Wood type: her agile walk accords with this, which is a good sign. As
mentioned in the chapter on observation, each Five-Element body type
has a characteristic walk and a deviation from this is not a good sign.
For example, the Wood type should walk in an agile way and if they
walked stiﬄy it would not be a good sign. Her dull complexion and dry
hair suggest Blood deficiency; the normal sparkle of her eyes suggested
that she did not suﬀer from any deep emotional problem.
   The marked amelioration during pregnancy and aggravation after
childbirth strongly suggests a deficiency of the Kidneys and the
disharmony of the Penetrating and Directing Vessels: this is confirmed
also by the onset of the headaches soon after menarche (which occurred
when she was aged 12½.
   We therefore need to confirm the presence of Blood deficiency and
Kidney deficiency with further questioning. To confirm or exclude
Blood deficiency, we ask about numbness and tingling of the limbs,
dizziness, poor memory, insomnia, blurred vision: she did suﬀer from
tingling of her limbs but from none of the other symptoms. However,
we can conclude that there is some Blood deficiency from the tingling
of her limbs, the dull complexion and the dry hair. As for Kidney
deficiency, she had no symptoms of it apart from lower backache, but
this symptom together with the onset of the headaches at menarche, the
amelioration during pregnancy and the aggravation after childbirth
confirms the presence of a Kidney deficiency and the disharmony of the
Penetrating and Directing Vessels.
   Her tongue was very slightly Pale but Red on the sides, Swollen and
with a sticky coating and there was a small, peeled patch on the left
side in the breast area; her pulse was generally Weak and Empty at the
deep level.
   The Pale colour of the tongue and the weakness and emptiness of
the pulse confirm Blood deficiency and Kidney deficiency. However,
the swelling of the tongue body and the sticky coating point to Phlegm,
something that was not apparent from observation nor interrogation:
her thin body indicates a tendency to Blood and Yin deficiency whereas
Phlegm usually manifests with a tendency to being overweight.
Furthermore, she had no other symptoms of Phlegm: there was no
dizziness, no blurred vision, no feeling of heaviness of the head, no dull
headaches, no expectoration of phlegm. However, in these cases, I
never discount the tongue signs and I concluded that, although she had
no other symptoms of Phlegm, the tongue signs were clear enough to
confirm the presence of Phlegm; this is confirmed by the aggravation of
the headaches in damp weather. The simultaneous presence of Liver-
Yang rising and Phlegm is a very common cause of chronic headaches.
   The character of her headaches points very clearly to Liver-Yang
rising: this is confirmed by the throbbing nature of the pain, the nausea
and vomiting, the sensitivity to light and the location of the headache
on the Gall-Bladder channel. We can therefore conclude that the causes
of the rising of Liver-Yang are the Blood and the Kidney deficiency: the
former constitutes the Manifestation (Biao ) and the la er the Root (Ben
). From the point of view of Deficiency and Excess, the former consists
of the Blood deficiency, Kidney deficiency and also Spleen-Qi
deficiency, while the la er consists of Liver-Yang rising and Phlegm.
We can deduce the presence of Spleen-Qi deficiency from the presence
of Phlegm and from the Weak pulse.
   The Pale colour of her tongue body can be a ributed to any or all of
her deficiencies, that is, Blood-Kidney- and Spleen-Qi deficiency. The
redness of the sides confirms the rising of Liver-Yang and the swelling
of the tongue body and the sticky coating indicate Phlegm. The last
aspect of her tongue to interpret is the peeled patch on the left side in
what may, under certain circumstances, be the breast area. There are
two ways of interpreting the significance of this peeled patch: it could
indicate either the very beginning of Yin deficiency (which may
develop from Blood deficiency) or a problem in the left breast. This
could be a problem in the left breast (such as mastitis) developed after
childbirth; however, the patient said that this was not the case. The
other possible explanation is that the peeled patch may indicate a more
serious potential problem in the left breast such as a malignant lump.
   In this case we need to treat both the Root and Manifestation
simultaneously: the Root by nourishing Blood, tonifying Spleen and
Kidneys and strengthening the Penetrating and Directing Vessels, and
the Manifestation by subduing Liver-Yang and resolving Phlegm.

        Case History 34.3
   A 50-year-old woman had been suﬀering from headaches since she
was 18 years old. The headaches occurred mostly on the right temple
area, were of a throbbing character and were accompanied by blurred
vision. The headaches were be er during two pregnancies and worse
from taking HRT.
   She also suﬀered from insomnia and constipation, her periods had
recently become irregular and the menstrual blood had dark clots. Her
cheeks were red and her eyes lacked sparkle and looked nervous. Her
tongue was Red and slightly Purple, redder on the sides and did not
have enough coating; her pulse was Fine and slightly Rapid.
   Diagnosis: The headaches are clearly due to the rising of Liver-
Yang, indicated by their throbbing character, the location on the temple,
the blurred vision, the red cheeks and the insomnia. In this case, Liver-
Yang rises from a deficiency of Liver-Yin, which is manifested by the
lack of coating on the tongue, the constipation and the blurred vision.
The amelioration during the pregnancies and aggravation from taking
HRT in this case indicate a Liver disharmony.
   The slightly Purple colour of the tongue indicates a tendency to
Blood stasis, of which the dark menstrual clots were the only symptom.

         Case History 34.4
   A 36-year-old man complained of migraine since the age of 11. The
a acks came every few months aﬀecting either side of the head along
the Gall-Bladder channel, the pain was sharp and throbbing and it was
often accompanied by vomiting and blurred vision. In between the
severe a acks, he occasionally suﬀered from a dull occipital headache.
He also suﬀered from high blood pressure for which he took
medication, which, however, did not control it well. He also
complained of a dry mouth and the interrogation did not reveal any
Kidney symptoms.
   He was overweight and his complexion was dull and pale with a
greasy skin and several small, pale moles on the face; his eyes were
very dull and lacking in lustre. His tongue was dark Red with a redder
tip, Swollen and with a rootless white coating that looked like salt.
Although he was on beta-blockers, which alter the pulse significantly
(making it Deep and Slow), his pulse was very Weak on both Rear
positions.
   Diagnosis: The headaches are clearly due to Liver-Yang rising,
which is evidenced by the severity and throbbing nature of the pain,
and by the vomiting and blurred vision. In this case, the origin of Liver-
Yang rising is in Liver- and Kidney-Yin deficiency: this is apparent from
the tongue, which shows a severe Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat. It is
unusual, but not infrequent, that there are no other symptoms of
Kidney deficiency and the dry mouth is the only symptom of Yin
deficiency. Exactly the same pathology that is causing the headaches is
also at the root of the hypertension.
   His complexion and body shape contradict the above pa erns
because the complexion is dull and pale (while it should be red or
floating red) and the body shape is overweight (whereas Yin deficiency
usually causes a person to be thin). This is due to the presence of
Phlegm of which he has no other symptoms. However, certain signs do
show the presence of Phlegm; these are the swelling of the tongue, the
dull-pale complexion, the greasy skin with small pale moles and the
overweight body shape. The lack of lustre of the eyes indicates severe
emotional problems (which he confirmed having), which may also be
causing the complexion to be dull and pale, contradicting the tongue.

         Case History 34.5
     A 41-year-old woman had been suﬀering from headaches for over
  20 years and they had worsened in the past year. The headaches
  occurred all over the head and were generally dull in character;
  occasionally they occurred on the left side of her forehead, in which
  case they were sharp and throbbing in character.
     She also suﬀered from chilblains, cold hands and feet and tiredness,
  and she felt cold in general. Occasionally she suﬀered a visual
  disturbance consisting in seeing flashing lights. She had had two
  children, aged 2 and 6 and she had suﬀered a heavy blood loss after the
  second childbirth.
     Her tongue was slightly Pale on the sides and had a Heart crack.
  Her pulse was Deep-Weak-Choppy.
     Diagnosis: There are symptoms and signs of Liver-Blood deficiency,
  manifested by the dull headaches, the visual disturbance, the Pale sides
  of the tongue and the Choppy pulse. This Blood deficiency was
  obviously aggravated by the haemorrhage after the second childbirth,
  which explains the aggravation of her headaches. Liver-Blood
  deficiency has in this case given rise to Liver-Yang rising, which is
  causing the sharp, throbbing headaches on the left side of the forehead.
  In addition to this, there are also manifestations of Kidney-Yang
  deficiency (feeling cold, cold hands and feet, tiredness and the Deep-
  Weak pulse).
     In this case, a ention should be paid to treating both the Root and
  the Manifestation but with special emphasis on treating the Root, that
  is, nourishing Liver-Blood and tonifying Kidney-Yang.

    DIZZINESS
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 55
   Dizziness is a common complaint, especially in the elderly in whom it often is the
main presenting problem.

    WHY WE ASK
   It is necessary to ask about dizziness particularly with elderly patients because
dizziness may be a symptom of Liver-Wind or Phlegm, or both, both of which are
pathogenic factors seen in Wind-stroke, to which elderly people are prone. In women,
dizziness is often a key symptom to establish the presence of either Liver-Blood
deficiency or a Kidney deficiency.

    WHEN WE ASK
   I generally ask about dizziness in the course of the interrogation to confirm or
exclude the presence of Liver-Blood deficiency, Kidney deficiency, Liver-Yang rising
or Phlegm in young and middle-aged people or of Liver-Wind in the elderly.

    HOW WE ASK
   When we ask about dizziness we should make it clear to the patient that, even if
this symptom is very sporadic, it still has a clinical significance. Thus, we should ask
something like ‘Do you ever experience any dizziness, even occasionally?'
   Dizziness can be due to four factors, which can be summarized as Wind, Yang,
Phlegm and Deficiency. In general a sudden onset of dizziness indicates a Full
condition whereas a gradual onset indicates Deficiency.
   The dizziness from Wind is very severe and the patient feels as if the ground is
moving to the point where he or she loses balance. This is Liver-Wind and is usually
seen only in the elderly.
   The dizziness from Liver-Yang rising may be also severe but less severe than that
from Wind and is accompanied by headache and blurred vision. This is common in
patients of all ages.
   The dizziness from Phlegm is less severe than in both Liver-Wind and Liver-Yang
and is accompanied by a feeling of heaviness and muzziness of the head and nausea.
   The dizziness from deficiency of Qi or Blood, or both, is mild. It worsens when the
person is tired; it may also be only postural. Dizziness from Deficiency may be due to
Blood deficiency (of the Liver or Heart, or both), in which case it is accompanied by
blurred vision, poor memory and insomnia, or to Kidney deficiency, in which case it is
accompanied by tinnitus.
   Of course, dizziness may also occur as a result of a head trauma.
   Case history 34.6 illustrates a pa ern underlying vertigo.

                Case History 34.6
          A 42-year-old woman had been suﬀering from severe vertigo
      a acks for 20 years. She suﬀered severe a acks with vomiting every 6
      months but she also experienced less severe a acks in between. The
      a acks occurred usually in the morning, were aggravated by lying
      down and alleviated by si ing up. These became more frequent after
      the birth of her second child 2 ½ years previously.
          She walked rather slowly, her complexion was dull and sallow, her
      eyes lacked sparkle and she generally looked very depressed. She had
      very few other symptoms: she felt cold in general, experienced
      chilblains in winter, suﬀered from catarrh and experienced backache.
          Her tongue was relatively normal apart from the sides being too
      Red; her pulse was Weak in general, especially on the left side, and both
      Kidney positions were very Weak and Deep.
          Diagnosis: In this patient, vertigo is caused by a combination of
      Liver-Yang rising and Phlegm. Apart from the dizziness, Liver-Yang
      rising is evidenced by the Red sides of the tongue and Phlegm by the
      catarrh, the vomiting, the aggravation on lying down and the
      amelioration when si ing up. Phlegm is causing the more frequent, less
      severe a acks of dizziness, while Liver-Yang rising is causing the
      occasional severe a acks.
          Apart from these two pa erns, there is a Kidney-Yang deficiency
      and a Spleen-Qi deficiency. The Kidney-Yang deficiency is manifested
      by the very Weak and Deep pulse on both rear positions, the
      aggravation of the dizziness after childbirth, the backache and the cold
      feeling, while the Spleen-Qi deficiency is manifested by the generally
      Weak pulse and the sallow complexion. Both Spleen-Qi and Kidney-
      Yang deficiency are obviously the root cause for the formation of
      Phlegm, while the Kidney deficiency is the cause for Liver-Yang rising.
      Therefore, Spleen-Qi and Kidney-Yang deficiency are the Root (Ben )
      while Liver-Yang rising and Phlegm are the Manifestation (Biao ).
   Box 34.2 summarizes the pa erns underlying dizziness.

     FAINTING
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 55
   ‘Fainting' may range from sudden collapse with total loss of consciousness to mild,
transient episodes of ‘passing out' but without total loss of consciousness. For
example, there are patients who periodically ‘pass out' but can still hear people
around them.
   The most important task is to diﬀerentiate Full from Empty causes of fainting. In
other words, fainting may occur either because a pathogenic factor obstructs the
Mind's orifices or because deficient Qi, Blood or Yin fail to anchor the Mind or
Ethereal Soul, or both.
   The most common pathogenic factor to cloud the Mind's orifices is Phlegm, which
will be manifested by a Swollen tongue with sticky coating and Slippery pulse.
Retention of food may also cloud the Mind's orifices, but this is rather more rare and it
occurs more in children or in the elderly.
   Among the Empty causes of fainting are a deficiency of Blood or Yin of the Heart
or Liver, or both, and a deficiency of Kidney-Yang.
   Fainting from a Full cause manifests with loss of consciousness, whereas fainting
from an Empty cause may manifest with transient episodes of ‘passing out' without
total loss of consciousness.
   Of course, in many cases, there may be a combination of Full and Empty pa erns,
for example Phlegm with Liver-Blood deficiency.
   Case history 34.7 illustrates a pa ern of Yin deficiency causing fainting episodes.

               Case History 34.7
          A 45-year-old woman had been suﬀering from what she described
      as ‘turns', that is, she had recurrent episodes of fainting but without
      total loss of consciousness as, during these episodes, she could hear
      people around her. These episodes were more frequent during or after
      her periods.
         She felt very tired in general and had very li le vitality and energy.
      Her complexion was dull and pale, her tongue was Pale, Swollen and
      partially peeled with a patchy, sticky coating and her pulse was Weak
      but slightly Slippery.
         Diagnosis: The swelling of the tongue with a sticky coating, and the
      Slippery pulse, clearly indicate Phlegm clouding the Mind's orifices
      and causing fainting. The Pale tongue, Weak pulse, dull-pale
      complexion and the aggravation of the fainting episodes during or after
      the period indicate a Liver-Blood deficiency. However, even in the
      absence of other symptoms, the partial peeling of the tongue clearly
      indicates a condition of Yin deficiency, in this case probably of the
      Stomach and Liver.
   Box 34.3 summarizes pa erns underlying fainting.

    FEELING OF DISTENSION OF THE HEAD
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 55
   A ‘feeling of distension of the head' is characterized by a bursting sensation as if
the head were cracking open. The two main causes of this symptom are Liver-Fire
blazing and Dampness obstructing the head.
   The feeling of distension of the head caused by Liver-Fire is very intense and is
accompanied by a headache of a throbbing nature, a dry mouth, bi er taste, a Red
tongue with redder sides and a Wiry pulse.
   The feeling of distension of the head caused by Dampness is less severe. Dull but
intense, it is accompanied by the sensation that the head were wrapped up. The head
feels heavy and the patient has nausea, a sticky tongue coating and a Slippery pulse.
   Box 34.4 summarizes pa erns underlying a feeling of distension of the head.

          BOX 34.4        FEELING OF DISTENSION OF THE
      HEAD
         • Liver-Fire blazing: very intense
         • Dampness in head: dull, less intense

    FEELING OF HEAVINESS OF THE HEAD
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 55
   The symptom of a ‘feeling of heaviness of the head' is very common but it is not
often reported spontaneously by patients and must be elicited on interrogation. There
are five main causes of a feeling of heaviness of the head:
         • invasion of Wind-Dampness
         • Damp-Heat infusing upwards
         • Dampness obstructing the Clear-Yang orifices
         • Phlegm obstructing the head
         • deficiency of Central Qi.
   The feeling of heaviness of the head deriving from invasion of Wind-Dampness
has a sudden onset and is due to external Dampness obstructing the head. It is
accompanied by other exterior symptoms such as aversion to cold, fever and a
Floating pulse.
   The feeling of heaviness of the head due to Damp-Heat infusing upwards is quite
severe and is accompanied by a dull headache, a red face, a feeling of heat of the head,
a sticky taste, a sticky yellow tongue coating and a Slippery-Rapid pulse.
   The feeling of heaviness of the head caused by Dampness obstructing the Clear-
Yang orifices is quite severe and is accompanied by blurred vision and a feeling of
muzziness of the head, nausea, decreased hearing, a sticky tongue coating and a
Slippery pulse.
   The feeling of heaviness of the head caused by Phlegm is severe and is
accompanied by dizziness, a feeling of muzziness of the head, blurred vision,
decreased hearing, a feeling of oppression of the chest, nausea, a Swollen tongue with
sticky coating and a Slippery pulse.
   The feeling of heaviness of the head caused by deficiency of Central Qi (deficiency
of Stomach and Spleen) is mild and it is due not to Dampness or Phlegm weighing the
head down, as in the previous cases, but to the Stomach and Spleen not nourishing the
brain; this being empty, it does not ‘sustain' the head, which therefore feels heavy.
   Box 34.5 summarizes pa erns underlying a feeling of heaviness of the head.

          BOX 34.5        FEELING OF HEAVINESS OF THE

         • Dampness: severe feeling of heaviness of the head with sticky
      taste
         • Phlegm: severe feeling of heaviness of the head with dizziness
         • Qi deficiency: mild feeling of heaviness of the head

    FEELING OF MUZZINESS (FUZZINESS) OF
THE HEAD
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 55
   ‘Muzziness' (or ‘fuzziness' in the USA) of the head indicates a feeling of heaviness
and cloudiness of the head accompanied by diﬃculty in concentration; it is usually
worse in the morning. As Phlegm in the head obstructs the orifices, a feeling of
muzziness is often accompanied also by a stuﬀed nose, blurred vision or a sticky taste.
   A feeling of muzziness of the head is due either to Dampness (with or without
Heat) infusing upwards towards the head, or to Phlegm in the head; if it is caused by
Phlegm there will also be dizziness.
   Box 34.6 summarizes a feeling of muzziness of the head.

           BOX 34.6           FEELING OF MUZZINESS
       (FUZZINESS) OF THE HEAD
           • Damp-Heat: feeling of muzziness of the head with headache and
       thirst
           • Dampness: feeling of muzziness of the head with sticky taste
           • Phlegm: severe feeling of muzziness of the head with dizziness

           Dampness and Phlegm in the head both cause a feeling of heaviness
       and muzziness, but only Phlegm also causes dizziness.

     BRAIN NOISE
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 55
   ‘Brain noise' should be distinguished from tinnitus: the former is experienced
inside the head whilst the la er consists of a ringing in the ears. The four main causes
of brain noise are:

           • deficiency of the Sea of Marrow
           • deficiency of Blood of the Heart and Spleen
           • Damp-Heat infusing upwards
           • Liver-Fire.
   The brain noise caused by deficiency of the Sea of Marrow is accompanied by
dizziness, poor memory, a weak back and legs; it is due to the deficient Marrow
failing to ‘fill' the brain.
   The brain noise caused by deficiency of Blood of the Heart and Spleen is
accompanied by dizziness, palpitations, insomnia, poor memory, a Pale tongue and a
Choppy pulse; it is due to Qi and Blood failing to rise to the head to brighten its
orifices.
   The brain noise due to Damp-Heat infusing upwards is accompanied by a feeling
of heaviness of the head, a dull headache, nausea, a sticky yellow tongue coating and
a Slippery-Rapid pulse; it is due to Dampness obstructing the head's orifices.
   The brain noise due to Liver-Fire is accompanied by irritability, hypochondrial
distension, sighing and a Wiry pulse; it is due to Liver-Fire rising to the brain.
   Box 34.7 summarizes pa erns underlying brain noise.

           BOX 34.7           BRAIN NOISE
          • Deficiency of the Sea of Marrow: brain noise with dizziness, poor

          • Heart- and Spleen-Blood deficiency: brain noise with dizziness,
      palpitations, insomnia, poor memory, Pale tongue, Choppy pulse
          • Damp-Heat: brain noise with feeling of heaviness of the head, dull
      headache, nausea, sticky yellow tongue coating, Slippery-Rapid pulse
          • Liver-Fire: brain noise with irritability, hypochondrial distension,
      sighing, Wiry pulse

     FEELING OF COLD OF THE HEAD
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 55
   A feeling of cold of the head is usually experienced on the occiput and, besides an
actual feeling of cold, it is characterized by a desire to wear a scarf around the neck
and an aversion to being exposed to wind. The two main causes of a feeling of cold of
the occiput are stagnation of Cold in the Liver channel and Emptiness and Cold of the
Governing Vessel.
   The feeling of cold from stagnation of Cold in the Liver channel is characterized by
a cold feeling of the occiput, vertical headache, a desire to cover one's head with a
scarf, cold hands and feet, a greenish complexion and vomiting.
   The feeling of cold of the head from deficiency and Cold of the Governing Vessel is
characterized by a cold feeling of the vertex, occiput and upper back, cold limbs,
feeling cold in general, a sore and weak back and dull pale complexion.
   Box 34.8 summarizes pa erns underlying a feeling of cold of the head.

     FEELING OF HEAT OF THE HEAD
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 55
   A ‘feeling of heat of the head' includes a subjective feeling of heat and an objective
hot feeling of the head to touch. The three main causes of hot feeling of the head are
Liver-Fire blazing, Kidney-Yin deficiency with Empty Heat and true Cold-false Heat.
   Liver-Fire may cause a feeling of heat of the head and face which is accompanied
by irritability, a bi er taste, thirst, a Red tongue with redder sides and a Wiry pulse.
   Kidney-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat may cause a feeling of heat of the head
accompanied by dizziness, tinnitus, five-palm heat and a Red tongue with redder tip
and no coating.
   If there is a feeling of heat in the head with malar flush, sore throat, loose stools,
cold limbs and Minute pulse, this may indicate true Cold and false Heat; this
condition is quite rare.
   Box 34.9 summarizes pa erns underlying a feeling of heat of the head.

    NUMBNESS/TINGLING OF THE SKIN OF THE
HEAD
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 55
   Numbness/tingling is called Ma Mu: Ma means ‘tingling' while Mu means
‘numbness'. The two main causes of numbness/tingling of the skin of the head are
Blood deficiency and Phlegm. Numbness is more often due to Phlegm, whereas
tingling is more often due to Blood deficiency.
   Numbness/tingling of the skin of the head due to Blood deficiency is accompanied
by dizziness, poor memory, blurred vision, palpitations, insomnia, a Pale tongue and
a Choppy pulse; it is due to Liver and Heart-Blood failing to nourish the skin of the
head.
   Numbness/tingling of the skin of the head due to Phlegm is accompanied by
dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, a feeling of oppression of the chest, a Swollen
tongue with sticky coating and a Slippery pulse; it is due to Phlegm stagnating in the
space between the skin and muscles.
   Box 34.10 summarizes pa erns underlying numbness and tingling of the head

        the chest, Swollen tongue with sticky coating, Slippery pulse

    ITCHY SCALP
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 55
   The most common cause of an itchy scalp is Liver-Blood deficiency and this is
especially common in women. An alternative cause is Liver- or Kidney-Yin deficiency,
or both. It should not be forgo en that Wind has a drying action on the skin, which
may also cause the scalp to be dry and itchy; this is more common in the elderly.
Other possible causes of an itchy scalp are Liver-Fire and Damp-Heat in the Liver
channel.

     INTRODUCTION

     WHY WE ASK
   Energetically, the face is an area of concentration of Yang channels. Pure Yang
needs to rise to the face to brighten the orifices so as to promote clear vision,
smell, hearing and taste. When clear Yang-Qi fails to ascend to the face,
Dampness or Phlegm often accumulate in this area, obstructing the sense orifices
and the sinuses. Dampness and Phlegm are extremely common pathogenic
factors and, not infrequently, facial symptoms (e.g. sinus problems) are their
only manifestation. For this reason, I nearly always ask about facial symptoms to
confirm or exclude the diagnosis of Dampness or Phlegm.
   Another reason for asking about facial symptoms is to confirm or exclude a
diagnosis of Heat or Empty-Heat by asking if the patient has experienced a
feeling of heat in the face, which is the main area where Heat or Empty-Heat
manifests.

     WHEN WE ASK
   I generally always ask about any feeling of heat in the face whenever a
pa ern of Heat or Empty-Heat emerges from the interrogation. It is important to
remember that we should ask about feelings of heat in the face even when the
patient presents with all the symptoms of Yang deficiency because there are
many situations when contradictory Hot and Cold symptoms appear. A
common example of this situation is in menopausal women who suﬀer from hot
flushes of the face occurring against a background of a simultaneous Kidney-
Yang and Kidney-Yin deficiency, with a predominance of the former. For other
causes of simultaneous hot and cold feeling, see Chapter 43 .
   I also ask about facial symptoms if I suspect a pa ern of Dampness or
Phlegm. In such a case I always question the patient about nasal symptoms (e.g.
runny or blocked nose), and about facial ache.

     HOW WE ASK
   When we ask about feelings of heat in the face, we should make it clear to the
patient that, even if this symptom is experienced only occasionally, it has a
diagnostic significance. We might therefore ask: ‘Do you occasionally feel hot in
the face?'
     FACE
Feeling Of Heat Of The Face
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 55
   It is important to ask if patients suﬀer from a feeling of heat in the face, even
if they feel cold in general. Especially in women, the two symptoms often
coexist.
   A feeling of heat in the face may be due to either Full- or Empty-Heat of any
organ. Full-Heat will manifest with a feeling of heat in the face occurring either
mostly in the daytime or throughout the day, whereas Empty-Heat manifests
with a feeling of heat in the face occurring mostly in the afternoon and evening.
(See Part 5 , Chapter 55 ).

     Women
   In women, more than men, a feeling of heat in the face is often associated
with contradictory Cold symptoms or signs in other parts of the body; for
example, women frequently experience a feeling of heat in the face when their
feet feel cold or they need to urinate frequently. Women's pathology diﬀers from
that of men and a feeling of heat in the face with contradictory Cold symptoms
may be due to four main causes.
   First of all, it may be due to a simultaneous deficiency of Kidney-Yang and
Kidney-Yin with some Empty-Heat - a situation that is very common in
menopausal women. In this case, the woman will experience hot flushes and a
feeling of heat of the face and other Empty-Heat signs, such as night sweating
and five-palm heat, but also Cold symptoms such as cold feet and frequent
urination, which derive from Kidney-Yang deficiency. Of course, a simultaneous
deficiency of Kidney-Yin and Kidney-Yang may occur in men too, but it is far
more frequent in women; indeed in my experience, especially in women over 40,
this situation is the norm rather than the exception.
   The second cause of a feeling of heat in the face with contradictory Cold
symptoms in women is a deficiency of Blood giving rise to some Empty-Heat;
the Blood deficiency may cause some Cold symptoms, especially cold hands,
and the Empty-Heat deriving from it may cause a feeling of heat in the face. This
pa ern (i.e. Empty-Heat from Blood deficiency) occurs only in women.
   The third cause of a feeling of heat in the face with contradictory Cold
symptoms in women is a disharmony of the Penetrating Vessel. When the Qi of
the Penetrating Vessel rebels upwards, it rushes to the face causing a feeling of
facial heat and, since it fails to descend to the legs through the descendent
branch, it causes cold feet. Again, such pathology of the Penetrating Vessel may
occur in men too but it is far more common in women.
   The fourth cause of a feeling of heat in the face with contradictory Cold
symptoms is Yin Fire. Of course, Yin Fire may occur in men as well as women.
    Men
   In men, a feeling of heat with contradictory Cold symptoms may be due to
three of the above-mentioned causes in women, that is, simultaneous deficiency
of Kidney-Yin and Kidney-Yang, rebellious Qi of the Penetrating Vessel and Yin
Fire. The first two of these are far less common in men than in women, however.
   In men, a feeling of heat in the face with contradictory Cold symptoms in
other parts of the body is usually due to coexisting pa erns, such as Liver-Fire
and Kidney-Yang deficiency.

         A feeling of heat in the face with contradictory Cold symptoms
      in women may be caused by:
         • simultaneous deficiency of Kidney-Yin and Kidney-Yang
         • Blood deficiency with Empty-Heat
         • disharmony of the Penetrating Vessel
         • Yin Fire.

    Facial Pain
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 55
   The five main causes of facial pain are invasion of Wind-Heat, invasion of
Wind-Cold, Damp-Heat, Liver-Fire and Qi deficiency with Blood stasis.
   The facial pain due to invasion of Wind-Heat is characterized by an acute
onset, a severe pain on the cheeks or jaws, a feeling of heat of the face, face
feeling hot on palpation, headache, sore throat and an aversion to cold and fever.
   The facial pain due to invasion of Wind-Cold is characterized by a spastic
pain of the cheeks and jaws with sudden onset, sneezing, runny nose, aversion to
cold, fever and a Floating-Tight pulse.
   The facial pain due to Damp-Heat is characterized by a severe pain in the
cheeks and forehead, and accompanied by red cheeks, greasy skin, a sticky
yellow or greenish nasal discharge and a sticky yellow tongue coating.
   The facial pain due to Liver-Fire is characterized by pain in the cheeks and
forehead, redness of the cheeks, thirst, bi er taste, a Red tongue with redder
sides and a Wiry-Rapid pulse.
   The facial pain due to Qi deficiency and Blood stasis is characterized by an
intense, often unilateral, pain of the cheeks, which is boring in nature and long in
duration and accompanied by a dark complexion and a Purple tongue.
   Trigeminal neuralgia is, of course, a type of facial pain; it is usually due to
Liver-Fire combined with Liver- and Kidney-Yin deficiency.
   Box 35.1 summarizes the pa erns underlying facial pain.

          BOX 35.1        FACIAL PAIN
         • Invasion of Wind-Heat: acute onset, severe pain of the cheeks
      or jaws, feeling of heat of the face, face feels hot on palpation,
        headache, sore throat, aversion to cold, fever
           • Invasion of Wind-Cold: acute onset, spastic pain of cheeks
        and jaws, sneezing, aversion to cold, dorsum of hands hot, runny
        nose, Floating-Tight pulse
           • Damp-Heat: severe pain in the cheeks and forehead, red
        cheeks, greasy skin, sticky yellow or greenish nasal discharge,
        sticky yellow tongue coating
           • Liver-Fire: pain in the cheeks and forehead, red cheeks,
        thirst, bi er taste, Red tongue with redder sides, Wiry-Rapid pulse
           • Qi deficiency and Blood stasis: intense, often unilateral pain
        of the cheeks, boring in nature and long in duration, dark
        complexion, Purple tongue
           • Liver-Fire with Liver- and Kidney-Yin deficiency: trigeminal
        neuralgia

        Feeling Of Numbness/Tingling Of The Face
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 55
   The five main causes of numbness or tingling in the face are invasion of
external Wind, internal Liver-Wind, Stomach-Fire, internal Wind with Phlegm
and Blood deficiency.
   Numbness or tingling in the face caused by invasion of external Wind is
characterized by a sudden onset and short duration and is accompanied by
deviation of eye and mouth.
   Numbness or tingling in the face caused by internal Liver-Wind is
accompanied by headache, giddiness, tremors and a Wiry pulse.
   Numbness or tingling in the face caused by Stomach-Fire is accompanied by
intense thirst, epigastric pain and a yellow tongue coating.
   Numbness or tingling in the face caused by internal Wind and Phlegm is
accompanied by deviation of the mouth, slurred speech and hemiplegia.
   Numbness or tingling in the face caused by Blood deficiency is accompanied
by a dull-pale complexion, blurred vision, dizziness, a Pale tongue and a
Choppy pulse.
   Box 35.2 summarizes the pa erns underlying numbness and tingling in the
face.

           BOX 35.2        FEELING OF NUMBNESS AND
        TINGLING IN THE FACE
           • External Wind: sudden onset, short duration, deviation of
        eye and mouth
           • Internal Liver-Wind: headache, giddiness, tremors, Wiry
        pulse
          • Stomach-Fire: intense thirst, epigastric pain, Yellow tongue
      coating
          • Internal Wind with Phlegm: deviation of the mouth, slurred
      speech, hemiplegia
          • Blood deficiency: dull-pale complexion, blurred vision,
      dizziness, Pale tongue, Choppy pulse

     NOSE
   The nose was called in Chinese medicine Ming Tang , which means ‘Bright
Hall', signifying that it is an area of concentration of Yang-Qi and a place
through which the clear Yang ascends to the head. The Song dynasty's Chen Wu
Ze says: ‘ The nose is the opening of the Lungs through which the five odours are
detected; it is the place where the Yin and Yang descend and ascend and through
which the Clear Qi flows .' 1 The nose is the external orifice of the Lungs and it is
therefore closely related to breathing, smell and sound (of the voice). The organs
influencing the nose are the Lungs, Kidneys, Spleen, Stomach, Gall-Bladder and
Governing Vessel. External Wind-Heat invades the body via the nose and mouth.
The nose can reflect pathological changes of many diﬀerent organs, the balance
of Yin and Yang, Heat and Cold, Deficiency and Excess, and stasis of Blood.

     Blocked Nose
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 58
   Excluding acute invasions of Wind, a blocked nose is usually caused by
Dampness stagnating in the nose occurring against a background of Lung- and
Spleen-Qi deficiency. In this case, the nose is often also swollen and pale and the
problem is intermi ent. This is a very common symptom in Western patients
and it often leads to chronic sinusitis.
   A blocked nose may also be caused by Qi and Blood stagnation, in which
case the nose would be swollen, purple and with an uneven surface.
   Gall-Bladder Heat may also cause a blocked nose, in which case the nose
membranes are red and swollen and there is a sticky yellow nasal discharge.
   In a newborn baby, a blocked nose (which may aﬀect its ability to breast-
feed) is usually due to invasion of Wind-Cold.
   Box 35.3 summarizes the pa erns underlying a blocked nose.

          BOX 35.3         BLOCKED NOSE
          • Lung- and Spleen-Qi deficiency: swollen and pale nose,
      problem comes and goes
          • Qi and Blood stagnation: swollen and purple nose
          • Gall-Bladder Heat: nose membranes red and swollen, sticky-
      yellow nasal discharge
         • Invasion of Wind: sudden onset, accompanied by symptoms
      of Wind-Cold or Wind-Heat

    Itchy Nose
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 58
   Excluding acute invasions of Wind-Heat, itchiness of the nose may be due to
Lung-Heat, deficiency of the Defensive Qi and, in children, Nose Childhood
Nutritional Impairment.
   When the cause is Lung-Heat, the nose is itchy, dry and red. The most
common cause of an itchy nose, however, is a deficiency of the Lungs' Defensive
Qi causing itchiness of the nose, sneezing and a profuse, watery nasal discharge
coming in bouts. This was called in Chinese medicine Bi Jiu and it corresponds
closely to allergic rhinitis in Western medicine. In my experience, however, the
symptoms of allergic rhinitis with itchy nose, sneezing and profuse watery
discharge are due also to a deficiency of Kidney-Yang and the Governing Vessel.
   In small children, an itchy nose may be a symptom of Nose Childhood
Nutritional Impairment. In such cases the itchiness is accompanied by scabs or
ulcers on the nose, a watery yellow nasal discharge, dry skin and hot hands and
feet, and the child has a tendency to pick his or her nose. This condition is
usually caused by irregular feeding and poor-quality breast milk, which leads to
Damp-Heat in the nose.
   Box 35.4 summarizes the pa erns underlying itchy nose.

         BOX 35.4         ITCHY NOSE
         • Invasion of Wind-Heat: sudden onset, accompanied by
      symptoms of an external invasion
         • Lung-Heat: itchy, dry and red nose
         • Deficiency of Lungs' Defensive-Qi system, Kidney-Yang and
      Governing Vessel: sneezing, profuse, watery nasal discharge
      coming in bouts
         • Nose Childhood Nutritional Impairment: scabs, ulcers,
      watery yellow nasal discharge, dry skin, hot hands and feet, nose
      picking

    Sneezing
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 58
   In acute cases, sneezing is always due to invasion of Wind, which may be
either Wind-Cold or Wind-Heat although the former is more common. The
sneezing is accompanied by aversion to cold, shivers, fever, body aches and a
Floating pulse. Other manifestations depend on whether the cause is Wind-Cold
or Wind-Heat.
   Chronic sneezing is always a sign of allergic rhinitis which, in Chinese
medicine, usually occurs against a background of Lung-Qi deficiency. In my
opinion, there will also be a deficiency of the Kidney Defensive-Qi system, as
well as of the Governing Vessel. In such cases, sneezing is accompanied by
allergy to house-dust mites or pollen, itchy nose, tiredness, sweating, slight
shortness of breath, a Pale tongue and a Weak pulse.
   Box 35.5 summarizes the pa erns underlying sneezing.

          BOX 35.5        SNEEZING
         • Invasion of Wind: sudden onset, aversion to cold, shivers,
      fever, Floating pulse
         • Deficiency of Lung-Qi, Kidney Defensive-Qi system and
      Governing Vessel: allergies, itchy nose, tiredness, sweating, slight
      shortness of breath, Pale tongue, Weak pulse

    Runny Nose
   Observation , Chapter 20 ; Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 58 .
   A runny nose with an acute onset is due to an invasion of Wind, which may
be Wind-Cold or Wind-Heat, but it is especially likely to occur with Wind-Cold.
The severity of this symptom reflects directly the severity of the Cold (as
opposed to Wind).
   A chronic, runny nose with a thick, sticky discharge, which is usually yellow,
is generally due to Damp-Heat in the Stomach channel (often corresponding to
sinusitis in Western medicine).
   A chronic, profusely runny nose with a clear, watery discharge indicates a
deficiency of Lung-Qi with Empty-Cold (often corresponding to allergic rhinitis
in Western medicine). Such a profuse, watery discharge may also be due to a
deficiency of Yang of both the Lungs and Kidneys and of the Governing Vessel
(see above).
   Box 35.6 summarizes the pa erns underlying a runny nose.

          BOX 35.6        RUNNY NOSE
         • Invasion of external Wind: acute onset
         • Damp-Heat in the Stomach channel: chronic, with thick
      sticky nasal discharge
         • Lung-Qi deficiency with Empty-Cold, deficiency of Yang of
      the Governing Vessel: chronic, with watery white nasal discharge

    Nose Ache
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 58
   Excluding acute invasions of Wind-Heat, nose ache may be due to Phlegm-
Heat in the Lungs, Lung-Qi deficiency or Lung- and Spleen-Qi deficiency.
   Nose ache due to Phlegm-Heat in the Lungs is accompanied by a sticky
yellow nasal discharge, a redness of the nose and a cough with expectoration of
sticky yellow phlegm.
   When due to Lung-Qi deficiency, the nose ache is accompanied by a watery
nasal discharge and spontaneous sweating, a weak voice and an Empty pulse.
   Chronic Lung- and Spleen-Qi deficiency with retention of Dampness in the
nose may also cause nose ache, in which case there is a sticky white nasal
discharge and often loss of the sense of smell.
   Box 35.7 summarizes the pa erns underlying nose ache.

          BOX 35.7        NOSE ACHE
          • Acute invasion of Wind-Heat: nose ache with aversion to
      cold, fever, body aches, Floating pulse
          • Phlegm-Heat in the Lungs: nose ache with sticky yellow
      nasal discharge, red nose, cough with expectoration of sticky
      yellow phlegm
          • Lung-Qi deficiency: dull nose ache, watery nasal discharge,
      spontaneous sweating, weak voice, Empty pulse
          • Lung- and Spleen-Qi deficiency with Dampness: nose ache
      with sticky nasal discharge, loss of sense of smell

    Nose Pain
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 55
   Excluding acute invasions of Wind-Cold and Wind-Heat, nose pain may be
due to Lung-Heat, Damp-Heat, Lung-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat, or nasal
cancer.
   Lung-Heat may cause nose pain in acute conditions when the pathogenic
factor enters the Qi level; it is accompanied by fever, a red face and nose, a cough
with yellow phlegm, thirst and a Rapid-Overflowing pulse. When nose pain is
caused by Damp-Heat, it is accompanied by a sticky yellow discharge, cheek
pain and a feeling of heaviness and heat in the face. When caused by Empty-
Heat of the Lungs, nose pain is dull and accompanied by a dryness and feeling
of heat in the nose, with nasal scabs and redness, night sweating, and a Floating-
Empty and Rapid pulse. It should be borne in mind that nose pain may also be
caused by carcinoma of the nose, in which case the nose pain extends to the head
and there is nosebleed with a swelling of the nasal mucosa.
   Box 35.8 summarizes the pa erns underlying nose pain.

          BOX 35.8        NOSE PAIN

      discharge, cheek pain, feeling of heat in the face and of heaviness
      of the head
         • Lung-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat: dull nose pain, scabs
      on the nose, dry nose, malar flush, dry cough, night sweating,
      Floating-Empty and Rapid pulse
         • Cancer of the nose: nose pain extending to the head,
      nosebleed, swelling of nasal mucosa

    Dry Nostrils
   Observation, Chapter 7 Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 58 .
   ‘Dry nostrils' refers to dryness of the nasal mucosa.
   Lung-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat can cause dryness of the nostrils
spreading to the throat. It is accompanied by a dry cough, night sweating and
five-palm heat.
   Dryness of the nostrils also appears in the Stomach-Heat pa ern at the Qi
level within the Four Levels identification of pa erns, together with fever, thirst
and sweating.
   Dryness of the nostrils may also be caused by Blood stasis, in which case the
nose bridge is dry and purple, there is thirst without desire to swallow, dark
rings under the eyes and a dark complexion.
   Chronic Lung- and Spleen-Qi deficiency may also cause dryness of the
internal mucosa of the nose, a loss of the sense of smell and often a turbid
discharge from the eyes.
   Box 35.9 summarizes the pa erns underlying dry nostrils.

          BOX 35.9         DRY NOSTRILS
         • Lung-Yin deficiency with Empty Heat: dry nostrils, dry
      throat, dry cough, night sweating, five-palm heat
         • Stomach Heat at the Qi Level: dry nostrils, fever, thirst,
      sweating
         • Blood stasis: dry nostrils and nose bridge, purple nose
      bridge, dark rings under the eyes, dark complexion, thirst with no
      desire to swallow
         • Lung- and Spleen-Qi deficiency: dry nostrils, loss of sense of
      smell, turbid discharge from the eyes

    Loss Of Sense Of Smell
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 58
   The most common cause of loss of sense of smell is a deficiency of Lung- and
Spleen-Qi with an inability of the clear Qi to rise to the nose. Cases of acute and
temporary loss of smell are due to invasion of Wind.
   An inability to smell fragrant smells when the nasal mucosa are swollen and
dark red is due to Damp-Heat in the nose.
   Loss of the sense of smell in the course of a serious illness always indicates a
poor prognosis.
   Box 35.10 summarizes pa erns underlying the loss of sense of smell.

          BOX 35.10        LOSS OF SENSE OF SMELL
         • Lung-Qi and Spleen-Qi deficiency
         • Invasion of external Wind (acute and temporary loss)
         • Damp-Heat

    TEETH AND GUMS
   The teeth are an extension of the bones and as such are governed by the
Kidneys while the gums are under the influence of the Stomach. More
specifically, the gums of the upper jaw are under the influence of the Large
Intestine, and those of the lower jaw are under the influence of the Stomach. The
state of the teeth and gums therefore reflects the state of the Kidneys, Stomach
and Large Intestine. For example, tooth cavities and loss of teeth may reflect a
Kidney deficiency, whereas receding gums may reflect a Stomach deficiency.

    Toothache
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 60
   As a general rule, a Full condition causes a toothache that is constant and
intense, whereas an Empty condition causes a toothache that comes and goes
and is mild. Toothache that is worse in the evening and be er in the morning
points to Yin deficiency; one that is be er in the evening and worse in the
morning indicates Yang deficiency. As far as channels are concerned, the upper
teeth are influenced by the Large Intestine channel and the lower ones by the
Stomach channel.
   Excluding external invasions of Wind, which cause an acute and temporary
toothache with aversion to cold, toothache may be caused by Stomach-Fire,
Toxic Heat, Heat in the Spleen and Heart, Damp-Heat, ‘Wind-Cold in the Brain'
or Stomach and Spleen deficiency.
   Stomach-Fire is a common cause of toothache, in which the toothache is
accompanied by thirst, swollen cheeks, dry stools, mental restlessness, a Red
tongue with a dry yellow coating in the centre and a Rapid-Overflowing pulse.
When Stomach-Fire combines with Toxic Heat, the toothache is very intense,
there may be a fever and the tongue would have a thick, dry yellow coating and
red points; this may correspond to a tooth abscess in Western medicine.
Toothache may also be caused by Heat in the Spleen and Heart, in which case
there may also be bleeding gums, insomnia and mental restlessness.
   Damp-Heat in the Stomach is also a frequent cause of toothache; it is usually
accompanied by swelling of the gums and a sticky taste in the mouth. The
relative importance of the toothache and the gum swelling gives an indication of
the prevalence of Heat or Dampness: if the gum swelling predominates over the
tooth-ache, Dampness is predominant; if the toothache pre-dominates over the
gum swelling, Heat is predominant.
   A severe toothache that extends to the head is due to ‘Wind-Cold in the
Brain' and Blood stasis. Stomach- and Spleen-Qi deficiency may cause a chronic,
dull toothache that comes and goes and receding gums; this may be due to
excessive consumption of sour foods.
   Other teeth symptoms include loose teeth and grinding teeth, and other gum
symptoms include inflamed gums, bleeding gums and receding gums. For the
diagnostic significance of these symptoms see Part 5 , Chapter 60 .
   Box 35.11 summarizes the pa erns underlying toothache.

          B O X 3 5 . 11     TOOTHACHE
         • Invasion of external Wind: acute toothache with headache
      and aversion to cold
         • Stomach-Fire: intense toothache, thirst, swollen cheeks, dry
      stools, mental restlessness, Red tongue, Rapid-Overflowing pulse
         • Toxic Heat: very intense toothache, very swollen cheeks,
      fever, Red tongue with red points and thick, dry yellow coating
         • Spleen- and Heart-Heat: toothache, bleeding gums,
      insomnia, mental restlessness
         • Damp-Heat in the Stomach: toothache with swelling of the
      gums and sticky taste
         • ‘Wind-Cold in the Brain' with Blood stasis: severe toothache
      extending to the head
         • Stomach- and Spleen-Qi deficiency: chronic, dull toothache
      with receding gums

    Inflamed Gums
   Observation , Chapter 8 ; Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 60 .
   Stomach-Heat is a common cause of inflamed gums; this may be either Full-
Heat or Empty-Heat from Stomach-Yin deficiency. Other causes include invasion
of external Wind-Heat in acute cases, and two conditions that aﬀect children and
are characterized by swollen and inflamed gums.

     Bleeding Gums
   Observation , Chapter 8 ; Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 60 .
   The gums may bleed either from deficient Spleen-Qi not holding Blood, with
tiredness, poor appetite and loose stools, or from Heat. This may be Stomach
Full- or Empty-Heat, or Empty-Heat from Kidney-Yin deficiency. In Stomach
Full-Heat there is a feeling of heat and thirst, in Empty-Heat there is thirst with a
desire to drink in small sips, and in Kidney-Yin deficiency there is tinnitus,
dizziness, night sweating and a malar flush.
   Box 35.12 summarizes the pa erns underlying bleeding gums.

          BOX 35.12         BLEEDING GUMS
          • Deficient Spleen-Qi not holding Blood: bleeding gums,
      tiredness, poor appetite, loose stools
          • Stomach Heat: inflamed, bleeding gums, feeling of heat,
      thirst
          • Stomach Empty-Heat: bleeding gums, dry mouth, desire to
      drink in small sips
          • Kidney-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat: bleeding gums,
      dizziness, tinnitus, night sweating, malar flush

     Receding Gums
   Observation , Chapter 8 ; Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 60 .
   Receding gums may be due to a general deficiency of Qi and Blood, Stomach-
Heat or Kidney-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat. Qi and Blood deficiency is
accompanied by tiredness poor appetite, loose stools and a pale complexion. In
Stomach-Heat there is thirst, a red face and a feeling of heat, while with Kidney-
Yin deficiency there is dizziness, a malar flush and night sweating. It should be
noted that ‘loose teeth' are a prominent symptom of Kidney deficiency pa erns;
however, teeth become loose generally because of gum disease. It can therefore
be assumed that the Kidneys influence the gums also.
   Box 35.13 summarizes the pa erns underlying receding gums.

          BOX 35.13         RECEDING GUMS
          • Qi and Blood deficiency: tiredness, poor appetite, loose
      stools, pale complexion
          • Stomach Heat: receding and inflamed gums, thirst, red face,
      feeling of heat
          • Kidney-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat: receding gums,
      dizziness, tinnitus, malar flush, night sweating

     MOUTH AND LIPS
   The mouth and lips are related to the Spleen. Chapter 37 of the ‘Spiritual
Axis' says: ‘The mouth and lips are the orifice of the Spleen' . 2 Chapter 17 of the same
book says: ‘The Spleen opens into the mouth. When the Spleen is harmonized the mouth
can distinguish the five flavours' . 3
   The mouth and lips are primarily influenced by the Stomach and Large
Intestine channels; the Liver channel wraps around the lips and so do the
Penetrating and Directing Vessels. Internally, other channels flow to the inside of
the mouth and the tongue and, in particular, the Heart Connecting channel, the
Kidney Main and Divergent channel and the Spleen main channel.
   The saliva is mostly under the control of the Stomach, Spleen and Kidneys
and a normal moisture of the mouth indicates a normal state of the Body Fluids.

     Mouth Ulcers
   Observation , Chapter 8 ; Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 60 .
   Recurrent mouth ulcers are a relatively common symptom and the most
important diﬀerentiation is that between ulcers deriving from a Full condition
and those deriving from an Empty condition. As a general rule, mouth ulcers
that recur very frequently or are even almost permanent indicate a Full
condition, whereas ulcers that come and go usually indicate an Empty condition.
   The most common cause of ulcers is Heat. Full-Heat should be diﬀerentiated
from Empty-Heat: in general mouth ulcers from Full-Heat are very painful and
with a red rim around them, whereas those from Empty-Heat are less painful
and with a pale rim around them.
   Mouth ulcers should be further diﬀerentiated according to their location:
ulcers on the gums are due to Full-Heat or Empty-Heat of the Stomach or Large
Intestine (the Stomach if on the lower gum and the Large Intestine if on the
upper gum); ulcers on the tongue are usually related to the Heart channel,
especially if they occur on the tip; ulcers on the inside of the cheeks are usually
related to the Stomach channel. In women, and especially in pregnancy or after
childbirth, a disharmony of the Directing Vessel may cause mouth ulcers;
typically these occur on the floor of the mouth under the tongue.
   The most common cause of mouth ulcers is Stomach-Heat in which case the
ulcers have a red rim around them, they are inside the cheeks or on the lower
gums and are associated with thirst, epigastric pain and a yellow tongue coating
in the centre. Another common type of mouth ulcer is that from Kidney-Yin
deficiency with Empty-Heat, in which case the ulcers have a pale rim around
them and are aggravated by overwork and lack of sleep; other symptoms and
signs would include a dry throat at night, night sweating and a Red tongue
without coating.
   Mouth ulcers may also arise from a severe Stomach- and Spleen-Qi deficiency
and a deficiency of the Original Qi: the depletion of the Original Qi (after a
chronic illness or from overwork) creates the conditions for the pathological
arousal of the Minister Fire, which flows upwards to the mouth causing mouth
ulcers. These ulcers are intermi ent, have pale rims, are aggravated by overwork
and are associated with other manifestations of Qi deficiency. For the diagnostic
significance of other types of mouth ulcers see Part 5 , Chapter 60 .
   Box 35.14 summarizes the pa erns underlying mouth ulcers.

          BOX 35.14         MOUTH ULCERS
         • Stomach Full-Heat: very painful, red-rimmed ulcers on the
      gums or on the inside of the cheeks
         • Stomach Empty-Heat: pale-rimmed ulcers on the lower
      gums
         • Large Intestine Full- or Empty-Heat: ulcers on the upper
      gum
         • Heart-Fire or Heart Empty-Heat: ulcers on the tip of the
      tongue
         • Disharmony of Directing Vessel: ulcers in pregnancy under
      the tongue
         • Kidney-Yin deficiency or Original-Qi deficiency: pale-
      rimmed ulcers aggravated by overwork

    Cold Sores
   Observation , Chapter 8 ; Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 60 .
   Cold sores are generally related to the Stomach channel and reflect Full-Heat,
Empty-Heat or Qi deficiency. When due to Stomach-Heat, the cold sores appear
suddenly and cause a burning pain; when due to Stomach Empty-Heat, they
come in bouts, recurring over many years; when due to Qi deficiency, they occur
in bouts over a long period of time, are usually pale in colour and are aggravated
by overwork.
   (For other signs related to the lips, see Part 5 , Chapter 60 .)

    TONGUE
Itchy Tongue
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 60
   Itchy tongue is generally due to Heat and this can be either external Heat in
the form of Wind-Heat or Heart-Heat, which may be Full or Empty.

    Numbness Of The Tongue
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 60
   Numbness of the tongue may be due to Heart-Blood deficiency or to Spleen-
Qi deficiency. In Full conditions, numbness of the tongue may be due to Phlegm
obstructing the orifices, to Liver-Wind or to chronic Blood stasis.

    Tongue Pain
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 60
   Pain of the tongue is always due to Heat and the most common cause is
Heart-Fire or Heart Empty-Heat. Liver-Fire or Phlegm-Fire in the Heart may also
cause tongue pain.

    INTRODUCTION
   Chinese medicine talks about the ‘throat' in general without distinguishing
the pharynx (related to both respiratory and digestive systems) from the larynx
(pertaining to the respiratory system). There are, however, signs that the ancient
Chinese doctors were aware of such a diﬀerentiation. For example, even as early
as 100BC , the ‘Spiritual Axis' said in Chapter 69 : ‘The throat is the passage for
food and drink; the throat is also where Qi goes up and down' . 1 It is interesting
that the Chinese text uses two diﬀerent terms in this sentence: Yan-hou for the
passage of food and Hou-long for the passage of Qi; both are translated as ‘throat'
in modern texts.
   Bearing in mind the dual function of the throat in respect of respiratory and
digestive systems, one can generally diﬀerentiate two broad types of throat
problems: one related to the respiratory system and in Chinese medicine to the
Lungs and Kidney channels, the other related to the digestive system and in
Chinese medicine to the Stomach and Large Intestine channels (see next section).
In adults, chronic sore throats are more commonly related to the Lung and
Kidney channels, and in children more commonly to the Stomach and Large
Intestine channels.
   With regard to Heat and Cold, the throat is prone only to Heat (whether Full
or Empty) and does not have any Cold pa erns.

    WHY WE ASK
   I generally ask about throat symptoms to confirm either a pa ern of Heat
(because the throat is an area of concentration of Heat) or a pa ern of Qi
stagnation.
   I usually ask about neck symptoms to confirm the presence of a Liver pa ern
such as Liver-Qi stagnation or Liver-Yang rising, which, barring invasion of
external Cold, comprise the most common causes of chronic neck ache.

    WHEN WE ASK
   It is useful to ask about throat symptoms when there is Heat (Full or Empty)
or Qi stagnation. If no earlier mention of throat symptoms has been made, I
generally ask about them towards the end of the consultation. I always ask about
the throat when I suspect a pa ern of rebellious Qi of the Penetrating Vessel.

    HOW WE ASK
   I usually ask patients whether they experience a feeling of tightness in the
throat or a sensation of having a lump in the throat. If the patients speak of
discomfort in the neck, it is important to ask them to point clearly to the area
involved: the sides of the neck are influenced by the Gall-Bladder channel and
often Liver pa erns, while the back of the neck is influenced by the Bladder
channel (see below).

    CHANNELS INFLUENCING THE THROAT
AND NECK
   The throat and the front of the neck form an area in which practically all
channels converge (see Fig 10.1 on p. 109 ). With the single exception of the
Bladder channel, 11 of the 12 channels course either through the front or the side
of the throat. Of the eight Extraordinary Vessels, six go through the centre or the
side of the throat; the exceptions are the Governing Vessel and the Girdle Vessel.
Thus, being influenced by so many channels and therefore Internal Organs, the
throat reflects clearly conditions of Yin-Yang, Heat-Cold and Deficiency-Excess
and is an important diagnostic area. The throat is influenced particularly by the
Lungs, Stomach, Large Intestine, Liver, Kidneys and Directing Vessel channels.
     THROAT
Sore Throat
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 59
   Both acute and chronic sore throat are due to Heat, which may be Full or
Empty; however, we should always check this symptom with the findings from
observation, especially in acute cases. A redness of the pharynx confirms the
presence of Heat, especially Full-Heat.
   When diagnosing sore throat, the first thing to establish is whether it is of
external or internal origin, and the clinical significance of this symptom will
therefore be analysed according to this distinction.

     Sore throat of external origin
   A sore throat of external origin has a sudden onset and short duration. In
external invasions of Wind a sore throat generally points to Wind-Heat rather
than Wind-Cold, especially if it is very severe. Other symptoms would include
aversion to cold, a fever (or body hot to touch), headache, sneezing and a
Floating-Rapid pulse.

     Sore throat of internal origin
   A sore throat from internal origin is usually due to Heat, which may be Full
or Empty. In general, the sore throat from Full-Heat is very severe and the throat
is red and swollen, whereas that from Empty-Heat is less severe, worse in the
evening and associated with dryness. However, a chronic sore throat may also
arise from a long-standing Yin deficiency, without Empty-Heat.
   In adults, the most common chronic sore throat is that from Kidney- or Lung-
Yin deficiency, or both, with Empty-Heat; this sore throat is not very severe, is
worse in the evening, and is associated with dryness of the throat and other Yin
deficiency manifestations. A chronic sore throat may also be caused simply by Qi
and Yin deficiency without Empty-Heat; in this case the sore throat is mild, it
comes in bouts, caused or aggravated by overwork, and is associated with other
Qi and Yin deficiency manifestations.
   In some cases patients complain of a ‘sore throat' that comes and goes
according to the emotional state; if there is no redness inside the throat and there
are no other signs of Heat, this may be due to stagnation of Qi (of the Liver or
Lungs) from emotional problems.
   In children, external Wind-Heat has a stronger tendency than Wind-Cold to
cause interior Heat. If not cleared properly after the initial stages, it is very likely
to give rise to residual pathogenic factors. When a child presents with a
recurrent, chronic sore throat, the two most common causes are either residual
Heat in the Lung channel following an invasion of Wind-Heat or an
accumulation of Heat in the Stomach and Large Intestine channels due to
retention of food. In the case of residual Heat in the Lung channel, the child will
present with a history of repeated invasion of Wind-Heat, which has usually
been treated with antibiotics; other manifestations may include a cough, thirst, a
feeling of heat, red cheeks and disturbed sleep. In the case of sore throat from
accumulation of Heat in the Stomach and Large Intestine channels, there will be
no history of repeated invasions of Wind-Heat, but rather one of successive
digestive upsets such as vomiting and regurgitation of food; other
manifestations may include abdominal pain, constipation, epigastric pain and
disturbed sleep.
   Box 36.1 summarizes the pa erns underlying sore throats.

          BOX 36.1        SORE THROAT
         • Invasion of external Wind-Heat: sore throat with acute onset,
      with aversion to cold, fever or hot body, Floating-Rapid pulse
         • Full-Heat in Stomach and Intestines: severe sore throat with
      swelling and redness
         • Kidney-/Lung-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat: chronic mild
      sore throat with dryness
         • Severe Qi and Yin deficiency: chronic, intermi ent mild sore
      throat aggravated by overwork
         • Residual Heat in Lung channel or Heat in Stomach and
      Large Intestine channel: recurrent, chronic sore throat in children
      with a history of Wind invasion or digestive upset
         • Qi stagnation (Liver or Lungs): chronic ‘sore throat' that
      comes and goes, without redness

    Dry Throat
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 59
   Excluding external invasions of Wind-Heat which may cause a dry throat, the
most common cause of chronic dryness of the throat is a deficiency of Yin of the
Lung or Kidneys, or both. In fact, in these situations, a dry throat is an important
symptom confirming the diagnosis of Yin deficiency. A chronic dryness of the
throat from Full-Heat may be related to the Stomach channel, but this is much
less common than the former type.
   Chronic dryness of the throat may also be related to the Liver and Gall-
Bladder channels and be caused by Heat in the Liver and Gall-Bladder or by the
Lesser Yang syndrome within the Six Stages or the Gall-Bladder Heat pa ern at
the Qi level within the Four Levels.
   Box 36.2 summarizes the pa erns underlying dry throat.

          BOX 36.2        DRY THROAT
         • External invasion of Wind-Heat
         • Lung-Yin deficiency
          • Kidney-Yin deficiency
          • Stomach-Heat
          • Heat in Liver and Gall-Bladder
          • Lesser Yang pa ern (Six Stages)
          • Gall-Bladder Heat (Four Levels)

     Itchy Throat
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 59
   Itchiness of the throat with sudden onset is always related to invasion of
Wind, which may be Wind-Cold, Wind-Heat or Wind-Dryness. Chronic itchiness
of the throat is usually due to Lung-Yin deficiency or Lung Dryness; in this case
the itchy feeling of the throat is worse in the evening and is associated with a
desire to drink water in small sips.

     Hoarse Voice
   Hearing, Chapter 53 ; Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 59 .
   In acute cases, hoarse voice is due either to external invasion of Wind-Heat or
to Lung-Heat, which may develop from such an invasion. In invasions of
external Wind the presence of a hoarse voice by itself indicates Wind-Heat rather
than Wind-Cold because the throat is a place where Heat easily accumulates. In
such cases, a hoarse voice is accompanied by a sore throat, aversion to cold,
fever, a Red tongue in the front or sides and a Floating-Rapid pulse.
   A hoarse voice may also occur with acute Lung-Heat after an invasion of
Wind-Heat. In such a case, the hoarse voice will be accompanied by a sore
throat, a feeling of blockage of the throat, cough with scanty yellow sputum,
chest pain, a Red tongue with dry yellow coating and an Overflowing-Rapid
pulse.
   In chronic cases, by far the most common cause of a hoarse voice is a
deficiency of Yin of both Lungs and Kidneys. In such cases, a hoarse voice is
accompanied by a dry throat at night, an itchy throat, weak voice, dizziness,
tinnitus, night sweating, a tongue without coating and a Floating-Empty pulse.
This pa ern is more common in the elderly.
   A less common cause of a chronic hoarse voice (also in the elderly) is an
accumulation of Phlegm and Blood stasis in the throat, in which case there will
also be a sore throat, a feeling of obstruction of the throat, thickening of the vocal
chords, nodules on the vocal chords, a swelling of the throat, a Purple tongue
and a Wiry pulse.
   Box 36.3 summarizes the pa erns underlying a hoarse voice.

          BOX 36.3         HOARSE VOICE
          • Invasion of Wind-Heat: sore throat, sudden onset, aversion
      to cold, fever, Red tongue, Floating-Rapid pulse
          • Lung-Heat: sore throat, feeling of blockage of the throat,
      cough with scanty yellow sputum, chest pain, Red tongue with a
      dry yellow coating, Overflowing-Rapid pulse
          • Lung- and Kidney-Yin deficiency: dry throat at night, itchy
      throat, weak voice, dizziness, tinnitus, night sweating, tongue
      without coating, Floating-Empty pulse
          • Phlegm and Blood stasis in the throat: sore throat, feeling of
      obstruction of the throat, thickening of the vocal chords, nodules
      on the vocal chords, swelling of the throat, Purple tongue, Wiry
      pulse

     Feeling Of Obstruction In The Throat
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 59
   The feeling of obstruction in the throat may be compared to having a piece of
meat lodged in the throat; it cannot be swallowed down or coughed up, but
there is no redness, no pain and no swelling of the throat. It is commonly
referred to as the Plum Stone Syndrome, although the first reference to this
syndrome in the ‘Discussion of Cold Induced Diseases' mentions a piece of meat
rather than a plum stone.
   This symptom is nearly always caused by a stagnation of Qi due to emotional
problems; modern Chinese textbooks always relate this to stagnation of Liver-Qi
and to emotional problems such as anger, repressed anger or frustration, but it
may also be due to Lung-Qi stagnation and failure of Lung-Qi to descend caused
by emotions such as worry, sadness or grief. Whatever the emotion or the
channel involved, when due to Qi stagnation the feeling of a foreign body in the
throat comes and goes according to the emotional state of the patient.
   A feeling of obstruction in the throat may be due also to rebellious Qi of the
Penetrating Vessel. In such a case, it would be accompanied by symptoms
throughout the course of this channel such as abdominal fullness or pain, or
both, menstrual irregularities in women, tightness of the chest, anxiety and
palpitations.
   However, stagnation of Qi and rebellious Qi of the Penetrating Vessel are not
the only possible causes of a feeling of obstruction in the throat. This symptom
may also be caused by deficiency of Yin of the Lung or Kidneys, or both. In this
case, the feeling of a foreign body in the throat is less severe than in the previous
case, it is worse in the evening and is aggravated by overwork.
   Box 36.4 summarizes the pa erns underlying a feeling of obstruction in the
throat.
          BOX 36.4         FEELING OF OBSTRUCTION IN
      THE THROAT
          • Liver- or Lung-Qi stagnation: severe, comes and goes
      according to mood
          • Rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel: worse in pregnancy
      or before menstruation, with abdominal fullness/pain, chest
      tightness, anxiety, palpitations
          • Lung-/Kidney-Yin deficiency: mild, worse in the evening,
      aggravated by overwork

     Swollen And Red Tonsils
   Observation, Chapter 10 ; Symptoms and signs, Chapter 59 .
   The tonsils are influenced by the Lung, Stomach and Large Intestine channels
and are prone to Heat or Toxic Heat.

     Acute conditions
   In acute conditions, redness and swelling of the tonsils may occur with an
invasion of Wind-Heat; indeed, this sign always indicates that the pathogenic
factor is Wind-Heat rather than Wind-Cold. However, swelling and redness of
the tonsils with an invasion of Wind also indicate that there is Toxic Heat of
external origin (this is an important diagnostic diﬀerentiation in the choice of
herbs as we will need to address the Toxic Heat).

     Chronic conditions
   In chronic conditions, redness and swelling of the tonsils indicates either
Heat (which may be Full or Empty) or Toxic Heat. These may aﬀect the Stomach
or Large Intestine channels. In children, chronic tonsillitis is nearly always
related to residual Heat or Toxic Heat (following repeated invasions of Wind-
Heat, especially if treated with antibiotics). In adults, chronic tonsillitis is often
due to Empty-Heat in the Lung or Stomach channel, or both.
   Case history 36.1 illustrates a pa ern underlying chronic tonsillitis.

               Case History 36.1
          A 24-year-old woman complained of chronic tonsillitis
      suﬀering two or three bouts each year since the age of 5. Six weeks
      prior to the consultation she had had her tonsils removed and she
      had been much worse since then, suﬀering from sore throat,
      tiredness, swollen glands, headaches, thirst, a feeling of heaviness
      and a congested feeling in the sinuses. Her pulse was Slippery on
      the whole, but Weak on the right. Her tongue was Red in the
      front, slightly Thin and with a sticky yellow coating.
      Diagnosis:
     This is a typical example of residual pathogenic factor and
  specifically Toxic Heat in the throat. This is an unusual case as the
  residual pathogenic factor stems from an operation, whereas it
  normally develops after a febrile disease. Toxic Heat is manifested
  by the swollen glands, the sore throat, a feeling of heaviness, the
  headache, the Slippery pulse and the Red tongue with a thick,
  sticky yellow coating. Obviously, Toxic Heat is only the acute,
  recent cause of her problem and there is an underlying deficiency
  of Stomach and Spleen, probably stemming from the chronic
  tonsillitis which she had suﬀered from since childhood. The
  deficiency of Stomach and Spleen is manifested by the tiredness
  and Weak pulse.
      Treatment principle:
     This is a very good example of a condition characterized by a
  mixture of Deficiency and Excess: the residual Toxic Heat is an
  Excess, acute condition and it constitutes the Manifestation (Biao ),
  whereas the deficiency of Stomach and Spleen is an Empty,
  chronic condition and it constitutes the Root (Ben ). In such cases,
  one should have a clear idea about the priorities of treatment, that
  is, whether one should treat the Excess, acute condition first or the
  deficient, chronic condition first. The pulse, tongue and severity of
  the symptoms are important guidelines to assist us in choosing
  the proper treatment principle. In this case, it is clear that the
  residual Toxic Heat should be eliminated first because the
  symptoms are acute, the pulse is Slippery and the tongue has a
  thick, sticky yellow coating.
      Treatment:
     The prescription used was a variation of the formula Li Yan
  Cha Benefiting the Throat Tea , which is specific for eliminating
  Toxic Heat from the throat.

Goitre
   Observation, Chapter 10 ; Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 59 .
   A discussion of goitre is relevant in interrogation as well as observation when
there is a past history of it, orwhen the patient has had a goitre but has
undergone an operation to remove it.
   Goitre is always by itself a sign of Phlegm. Very frequently, the pathology of
Phlegm is combined with Qi stagnation in the throat; this is not always related to
the Liver but may be related to the Lungs and Stomach too. In such cases, it is
accompanied by irritability, depression, and variation in the goitre size
according to mood. In chronic cases, there is always an underlying deficiency of
Qi or Yin, or both, which may cause the goitre to go up and down.
   Goitre is closely related to the Liver and Lung channel and Liver-Fire
combined with Phlegm is a frequent cause of it. Finally, in chronic cases, Phlegm
may also combine with Blood stasis to cause goitre. In case of Liver-Fire and
Blood stasis the goitre would be hard; in all other cases, it would feel soft to
palpation.
   Box 36.6 summarizes the pa erns underlying goitre.

           • Yin deficiency with Phlegm: small soft goitre of variable size,
      tiredness
           • Liver-Fire with Phlegm: hard goitre, irritability
           • Liver-Blood stasis with Phlegm: hard goitre, Purple tongue

    Painful Or Stiff Neck
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 62
   The most common cause of a painful or stiﬀ neck is retention of Wind and
Dampness in the muscles of the neck; this is a type of Painful Obstruction
Syndrome. It is very common in cold and damp climates and varies with the
weather.
   Another common cause of a painful or stiﬀ neck is Liver-Qi stagnation and
this is usually due to stress, frustration and resentment being held in. It comes
and goes according to the mood and is not aﬀected by the weather. Liver-Yang
rising or Liver-Wind may also cause a stiﬀ or painful neck and this is more
common in the elderly; it is often, but not necessarily, associated with
hypertension.
   A less common cause of a stiﬀ or mildly painful neck is a Kidney deficiency,
being due to Kidney-Yang not nourishing the Bladder channel in the neck. This
causes only chronic stiﬀ neck and again is seen usually only in the elderly.
   Invasion of external Wind-Cold causes an acute stiﬀ neck with all the other
characteristic symptoms of external invasions such as sudden onset, aversion to
cold and sneezing.
   Box 36.7 summarizes the pa erns underlying painful or stiﬀ neck.

          BOX 36.7        PAINFUL OR STIFF NECK

      not reacting to weather
         • Liver-Yang rising: intense stiﬀness, dizziness, propensity to
      outbursts of anger, Wiry pulse, often with hypertension (in
      elderly)
         • Liver-Wind: stiﬀness, tremor, often with hypertension (in
      elderly)
         • Kidney deficiency: chronic, more common in the elderly
         • Invasion of Wind-Cold: sudden onset, acute, accompanied
      by aversion to cold and sneezing

    INTRODUCTION
   Questions about the body concern mostly pain and numbness. Chest and
abdomen are discussed in Chapter 38 and limbs in Chapter 39 .

    WHY WE ASK
   Apart from the question regarding lower backache, which I ask every time I
suspect a Kidney deficiency, questions about the body concern mostly symptoms
aﬀecting the whole body which do not pertain to any specific area, such as pain,
numbness or itching of the whole body or loss of weight or obesity.

    WHEN WE ASK
   Apart from the question about backache, I generally ask questions about the
body only if relevant. In particular, the question about gain or loss of weight is
important to give us an idea of the state of Blood and Yin and of the Stomach
and Spleen.

    HOW WE ASK
   The questions about the body concerning numbness, pain or itching are self-
explanatory.
     ACHES IN THE WHOLE BODY
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 68
   By ‘aches in the whole body', I refer to aching or pain in most of the joints
and muscles; it is not a common symptom. The most important distinction is that
according to onset. Aching or pain in the whole body with sudden onset is due
to invasion of external Wind and it is therefore accompanied by aversion to cold,
shivers, fever and a Floating pulse.
   In chronic conditions, the most common cause of aches in the whole body is
deficiency of Qi and Blood. In this case, it is accompanied by pronounced
lassitude and it is ameliorated by rest.
   Aches in the muscles of the body and especially the limbs are usually due to
retention of Dampness in the muscles and are frequently seen in ME (postviral
fatigue syndrome); in this case, the muscle ache is accompanied by a pronounced
feeling of heaviness of the limbs and body. Aches in all the muscles with a hot
sensation of the body on palpation are due to Stomach-Heat.
   Pain in the arms and shoulders experienced only when walking is due to
Liver-Qi stagnation.
   In women after childbirth, pain in the whole body is due to Blood deficiency
if it is dull or to Blood stasis if it is severe and stabbing.
   Box 37.1 summarizes the pa erns underlying aches in the whole body.

           BOX 37.1         ACHES IN THE WHOLE BODY
          • Invasion of external Wind: aching with aversion to cold,
      shivers, fever, Floating pulse
          • Deficiency of Qi and Blood: aching with lassitude,
      ameliorated by rest
          • Retention of Dampness in the muscles: aching with feeling of
      heaviness of the limbs and body
          • Stomach-Heat: aching with hot sensation of the body
          • Liver-Qi stagnation: pain in the arms and shoulders when
      walking
          • Blood deficiency: dull pain after childbirth
          • Blood stasis: severe, stabbing pain after childbirth

     PAIN IN THE JOINTS
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 68
   Pain in the joints is due to invasion of Wind, Dampness or Cold in the
channels of the joints. Joint ache from Wind moves from joint to joint; joint pain
from Dampness is fixed and is characterized by swelling and numbness; joint
pain from Cold is fixed, usually in one joint only and the pain is intense.
   In chronic cases, any of the above pathogenic factors can transform into Heat,
Dampness is formed and Damp-Heat accumulates in the joints causing chronic
pain. Severe stabbing pain in the joints may be due to Blood stasis.
   Box 37.2 summarizes the pa erns underlying joint pain.

          BOX 37.2        JOINT PAIN
         • Invasion of Wind: pain wandering from joint to joint
         • Invasion of Dampness: pain with swelling and feeling of
      heaviness/numbness
         • Invasion of Cold: severe pain in single joint
         • Damp-Heat: chronic pain, swelling, redness
         • Blood stasis: severe, stabbing pain, rigidity

    LOWER BACKACHE
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 67
   Acute pain in the lower back is due either to sprain or to invasion of Cold. If
it is due to sprain, the pain is intense, with pronounced stiﬀness, and is
improved by rest and aggravated by movement; this pain is due to local
stagnation of Qi and Blood. If the pain is due to invasion of Cold, it is worse with
rest, usually worse in the mornings, and is alleviated by gentle movement.
Chronic lower backache is due to a Kidney deficiency, in which case the
backache is alleviated by rest and aggravated by overwork and excessive sexual
activity. In many cases of chronic lower backache, there is a combination of the
above three factors; for example an underlying Kidney deficiency (causing a
chronic dull ache) predisposes the patient to invasion of Cold or to sprain and
therefore to periodic acute a acks.
   Pain of the lower back extending to the upper back is usually due to a
combination of Kidney deficiency and Liver-Qi stagnation.
   Box 37.3 summarizes pa erns underlying lower backache.

          BOX 37.3        LOWER BACKACHE
         • Sprain: acute lower backache ameliorated by rest, aggravated
      by movement
         • Invasion of Cold: acute lower backache aggravated by rest,
      ameliorated by movement
         • Kidney deficiency: chronic lower backache ameliorated by
      rest, aggravated by overwork or sexual activity
         • Kidney deficiency and Liver-Qi stagnation: chronic lower
      backache extending to the upper back
     NUMBNESS/TINGLING
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 68
   Numbness or tingling may be due to three main causes: Blood deficiency,
Phlegm or internal Wind. With Blood deficiency, there is numbness or tingling of
both arms or legs or only hands or feet; this is more common in women. Phlegm
may cause numbness or tingling in one or both limbs usually accompanied by a
feeling of heaviness. Internal Wind usually causes unilateral numbness in a limb;
if it aﬀects the first three fingers in an old person this may indicate the possibility
of impending Wind-stroke.
   Box 37.4 summarizes the pa erns underlying numbness and tingling of the
body.

          BOX 37.4        NUMBNESS/TINGLING
          • Blood deficiency: both limbs, more in women
          • Phlegm: with feeling of heaviness
          • Internal Wind: usually unilateral

     ITCHING
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 68
   The three main causes of itching are generally Wind, Dampness or Heat;
these three pathogenic factors cause intense itching. Blood deficiency may also
cause itching, which would be less intense than the three above-mentioned
pathogenic factors.
   Itching caused by Wind is very intense and it occurs either in diﬀerent parts
of the body, moving from one place to another, or in the whole body. The itching
due to Wind may be accompanied by a rash but it may also occur without any
external skin signs. Itching caused by Wind may also be accompanied by dry
skin because Wind itself has a drying eﬀect. In itching caused by Wind the
patient has an irresistible desire to scratch; the skin may break and bleed but it
heals soon after scratching.
   Itching caused by Dampness is more localized, and usually occurs only in
specific places such as the axilla, the genital region or the hands or feet. It is
accompanied by the appearance of vesicles and the skin breaks after scratching,
oozing a fluid that may be white or yellow according to whether the Dampness
is associated with Cold or Heat. Itching caused by Damp-Heat is more intense
and is characterized by the appearance of yellow vesicles or pustules. In severe,
chronic cases the pustules may fester and ooze pus and blood.
   Itching caused by Blood-Heat is usually accompanied by a red rash and it
may occur either locally or in the whole body.
   Itching caused by Blood deficiency is less intense, the skin is dry and scaly
and the itching is worse at night.
   Itching caused by Toxic Heat is very intense and is accompanied by the
appearance of furuncles or festering ulcers which ooze pus and blood. Toxic
Heat in the skin is often a complication of chronic eczema when the skin
becomes infected.
   Under certain circumstances itching can be a normal manifestation that
occurs during healing of wounds or ulcers.
   Box 37.5 summarizes the pa erns underlying itching.

         BOX 37.5        ITCHING
         • Wind: intense generalized itching, possibly moving, with
      rash or dry skin
         • Dampness: localized itching, damp skin, vesicles
         • Blood-Heat: itching with a red rash
         • Blood deficiency: mild generalized itching with dry skin,
      worse at night
         • Toxic Heat: intense itching with pustules, ulcers or eczema
         • Itching during healing of wounds or ulcers: normal

    LOSS OF WEIGHT
   The two most common causes of loss of weight are Blood or Yin deficiency;
other causes include Stomach- and Spleen-Qi deficiency, Stomach-Heat and
Liver-Fire. Although Stomach- and Spleen-Qi deficiency normally tend to make
a person overweight because they lead to Dampness and Phlegm, in severe cases
(such as in anorexia) they may lead to loss of weight because the body is not
nourished by the Food Essences.

    OBESITY
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 68
   When not due purely to overeating, obesity is generally caused by retention
of Damp-Phlegm occurring against a background of Spleen-Qi or Kidney-Yang
deficiency, or both.

             Chest pain
             Pain in the ribs

             Palpitations
    ABDOMEN

             Sensations
             Areas of abdominal pain
   Interrogations in relation to diagnoses of the chest and abdomen are
discussed separately below.

     CHEST
   The chest, or thorax, refers to the part of the body enclosed by the ribs and
breast bone. From the Chinese point of view, there is a diﬀerence between the
front part of the chest, which is under the influence of the Heart and Lungs, and
the sides of the chest, which are under the influence of the Liver and Gall-
Bladder. The front of the chest is also the area where the Gathering Qi (Zong Qi )
is concentrated (see Fig 12.1 , p. 121 ).

     WHY WE ASK
   It is necessary to ask about chest symptoms because some of them occur
frequently in practice. In particular, symptoms often manifest themselves in the
chest; for example, a feeling of oppression may be felt there, or palpitations,
which often derive from emotional stress.
   Patients do not often volunteer information on chest symptoms unless we
ask. For example, in my experience, few patients will actually describe
experiencing a ‘feeling of oppression' in the chest.
   In addition, both the tongue and the pulse frequently reflect a pathology of
the chest: a Purple area in the tongue's chest area (see Fig 23.10 on p. 206 ), for
example, or a pulse that is Weak and Deep on both Front positions.

     WHEN WE ASK
   Chest symptoms often reflect very common pathologies such as Liver-Qi
stagnation, Phlegm in the chest and Heart-Blood deficiency. Therefore, I
specifically ask about chest symptoms quite early in the interrogation as patients
are describing their symptoms.

     HOW WE ASK
   It is important to be sensitive when asking questions regarding the chest
because people often fear that if we ask about the chest we suspect a heart
pathology. Besides this, some typical Chinese expressions are not used by
Western patients and we should therefore phrase the question in a way that is
understandable to the patient. For example, few patients will actually use the
expression ‘feeling of oppression of the chest'; they will probably describe a
‘feeling of tightness of the chest' or say a feeling was ‘like having a weight on the
chest'.
   ‘Palpitations' is another example of the importance of asking questions in a
way that the patient can understand. Most people think that palpitations are
synonymous with tachycardia, that is, the heart beating faster than normal. We
should therefore explain to the patient that ‘palpitations' simply means an
uncomfortable sensation of being aware of one's heartbeat.

     Cough
   Observation, Chapter 20 ; Hearing, Chapter 53 ; Symptoms and Signs,
Chapter 63
   When a patient presents with a cough, we must first of all establish whether
it is an acute or a chronic cough. By ‘acute' we mean a cough that had a sudden
onset and may continue for a few days or weeks. By ‘chronic', we mean either a
cough that began insidiously without a previous invasion of Wind and persisted
for months or years, or one that began with an exterior invasion of Wind and
persisted for months or years.
   An acute cough may have any of three causes. First, it may be an acute cough
in the very beginning stages of an invasion of Wind, when the pathogenic factor
is still on the Exterior. Secondly, it may be an acute cough with the pathogenic
factor (such as Heat or Phlegm-Heat) in the Interior following an external
invasion. Thirdly, it may be an acute cough caused by a residual pathogenic
factor (such as Dryness or Phlegm) following an external invasion. In the first
case the cough will be accompanied by signs of the external invasion such as
aversion to cold, fever, sore throat, a runny nose and a Floating pulse. Heat or
Phlegm-Heat in the Lungs produces a barking cough with yellow mucus,
feelings of heat and thirst, and an Overflowing-Rapid pulse. In residual Dryness
with Phlegm in the Lungs, the cough is dry with diﬃcult expectoration of scanty
sputum after repeated bouts of coughing, and a tickling sensation in the throat.
   A chronic cough is generally due either to chronic retention of Phlegm in the
Lungs (which may be combined with Dampness, Heat or Dryness), or to
deficiency of Qi or Yin, or both, of the Lungs.
   A very common type of chronic cough is one due to Damp-Phlegm in the
Lungs, which is characterized by the expectoration of profuse, white sputum
which is easy to expectorate, a feeling of oppression of the chest, a Swollen
tongue with a sticky coating and a very Slippery pulse. When Phlegm combines
with Heat in the Lungs the cough has a louder sound and is characterized by the
expectoration of yellow sputum, a feeling of oppression of the chest, a feeling of
heat and a Red and Swollen tongue with a sticky yellow coating and a Slippery-
Rapid pulse.
   A common type of chronic cough in the elderly is that due to Dry-Phlegm in
the Lungs which is characterized by a chronic, dry cough with a weak sound and
the occasional, diﬃcult expectoration of scanty sputum, a dry throat and a
Swollen tongue with a dry coating.
   A chronic cough due to a deficiency of Lung-Qi or Lung-Yin is characterized
by a slight, dry cough with a weak sound, dry throat in the evening
accompanied by the signs of Qi or Yin deficiency, such as night sweating, and a
tongue without coating.
   Case history 38.1 illustrates a pa ern underlying chronic cough.

               Case History 38.1
         A 48-year-old woman had been suﬀering from a persistent
      cough for 6 months: she felt she had some phlegm in the throat
      but this was diﬃcult to expectorate so that the cough was often
      dry. When she did expectorate some sputum, this was thick,
      sticky and white. She also complained of breathlessness and a
      feeling of tightness and oppression of the chest. A chest specialist
      had diagnosed bronchiectasis.
         She was thin and slightly built and she had experienced loss of
      weight for the past 2 years. Her complexion was very dull and
      sallow. She also suﬀered from a general cold feeling, cold hands
      and feet, constipation and a yellow vaginal dis-charge.
         Her tongue-body colour was normal but the tongue body was
      Swollen; the back of the tongue had a rootless, yellow coating but
      no ‘spirit'. Her pulse was Weak in general, especially in both the
      Rear positions, but also slightly Slippery.
      Diagnosis:
     The cough with expectoration of thick, sticky white sputum,
  together with the breathlessness and feeling of tightness and
  oppression of the chest, indicate the presence of Damp-Phlegm in
  the Lungs, which is confirmed by the swelling of the tongue body
  and the Slippery pulse. The general cold feeling, cold hands and
  feet, constipation and Weak Rear pulse positions also indicate
  Kidney-Yang deficiency, which obviously contributed to the
  formation of Phlegm. The Kidney deficiency is also evidenced by
  the absence of ‘spirit' on the root of the tongue. Besides Damp-
  Phlegm in the Lungs, there is also Damp-Heat in the Lower
  Burner, which causes the yellow vaginal discharge.
     The loss of weight which occurred in the previous 2 years and
  the rootless tongue coating point to the beginning of a situation of
  Kidney-Yin deficiency, which may sometimes develop from
  Kidney-Yang deficiency.
     The treatment should concentrate first on resolving Damp-
  Phlegm and stimulating the descending of Lung-Qi and secondly
  on tonifying the Kidneys.

          evening, night sweating, tongue without coating

     Chest Pain
   Observation, Chapter 16 ; Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 63
   Here ‘chest' indicates the front of the chest. A pain in this area is usually due
to either the Heart or Lung channel and it always denotes a Full condition (even
though this may itself derive from an underlying Empty condition).
   Chest pain can be diﬀerentiated according to its character. A fixed, pricking,
stabbing or needle-like pain indicates Blood stasis. Chest pain accompanied by a
feeling of distension of the chest itself and the hypochondrium indicates Qi
stagnation and is usually accompanied by sighing and irritability. An
intermi ent, chronic chest pain that comes and goes also indicates Blood stasis
but suggests an underlying Empty condition of Qi or Yang deficiency.
   A stabbing or pricking chest pain indicates Blood stasis aﬀecting the Heart
channel (especially if it radiates down the left arm) and this often occurs against
a background of Heart-Yang deficiency; it falls into the category of Chest Painful
Obstruction Syndrome.
   Chest pain accompanied by cough with expectoration of profuse yellow
sputum is due to Phlegm-Heat in the Lungs and this may be seen in acute lung
conditions, such as bronchitis, pneumonia or pleuritis.
   A chest pain in a large area of the chest together with a cough, breathlessness
and a red face indicates Lung-Heat. Chest pain extending to the hypochondrial
region may be due to Damp-Heat in the Liver and Gall-Bladder channel, in
which case it may be accompanied by feeling of heaviness and a sticky taste.
   Pain in the heart region on the left side of the chest indicates either Heart-
Blood stasis or Phlegm obstructing the Heart channel.
   Chest pain extending to the upper back is usually due to Phlegm or Blood
stasis.
   Box 38.2 summarizes the pa erns underlying chest pain.

     Pain In The Ribs
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 63
   ‘Pain in the ribs' refers to pain on the lateral aspect of the rib cage above the
hypochondrial area.
   The most common pa erns causing pain in the ribs are Liver-Qi stagnation,
Blood stasis and Damp-Heat in the Gall-Bladder. The characteristic symptoms of
these pa erns are listed in Box 38.3 .

          BOX 38.3        PAIN IN THE RIBS
          • Liver-Qi stagnation: pain in the ribs with a pronounced
      feeling of distension
          • Blood stasis: severe, stabbing pain
          • Damp-Heat in the Liver and Gall-Bladder: pain in the ribs
      with a feeling of oppression and heaviness

     Feeling Of Oppression Of The Chest
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 63
   A feeling of oppression of the chest is the translation of the Chinese term
Xiong Men . Western patients, at least in Anglo-Saxon countries, would seldom
use this term and report this symptom as a feeling of tightness, discomfort in the
chest, or the sensation of having a weight on the chest.
   A feeling of oppression of the chest accompanied by slight breathlessness,
sighing, a cough and expectoration of phlegm indicates retention of Phlegm in
the Lungs, which is the most common cause of this symptom. A feeling of
oppression of the chest without a cough and without expectoration of phlegm,
and accompanied by slight breathlessness, sighing and a feeling of a lump in the
throat, indicates stagnation of Lung-Qi with Lung-Qi failing to descend; this is
usually caused by emotional problems such as sadness or worry. Although a
feeling of a lump in the throat is usually related to Liver-Qi stagnation,
stagnation of Lung-Qi caused by emotional problems is a very frequent cause of
this symptom together with a feeling of oppression of the chest.
   Another very common cause of a feeling of oppression of the chest is
rebellious Qi of the Penetrating Vessel, which is more common in women.
However, before diagnosing rebellious Qi of the Penetrating Vessel, we should
check whether the feeling of oppression of the chest is accompanied by other
relevant symptoms such as abdominal distension or fullness, pain or fullness
around the umbilicus, or epigastric tightness.
   In a few cases, a severe stagnation of Liver-Qi from emotional problems may
also cause a feeling of oppression of the chest.
   Box 38.4 summarizes the pa erns underlying a feeling of oppression of the
chest.

            BOX 38.4        FEELING OF OPPRESSION OF
         THE CHEST
            • Phlegm in the Lungs: slight breathlessness, sighing, cough
         with expectoration of phlegm
            • Stagnation of Lung-Qi: sighing, feeling of lump in the throat,
         slight breathlessness without cough or expectoration
            • Rebellious Qi of the Penetrating Vessel: abdominal
         distension/fullness, epigastric tightness, pain/fullness around
         umbilicus
            • Severe Liver-Qi stagnation: depression, irritability

     Feeling Of Heat In The Chest
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 63
   Excluding external invasions of Wind-Heat, a feeling of heat in the chest is
due to Full- or Empty-Heat of the Lung or Heart channels. If there is a feeling of
heat in the chest, accompanied by thirst, insomnia, palpitations, agitation and a
Red tip of the tongue, this indicates Heart-Fire; if there is a feeling of heat in the
evening, dry mouth at night, insomnia, night sweating and five-palm heat, it is
due to Heart Empty-Heat.
   A feeling of heat in the chest accompanied by a cough, hot hands, a red face
and expectoration of yellow mucus is due to Lung-Heat; if it is accompanied by
night sweating, a feeling of heat in the afternoon, five-palm heat, a dry throat at
night and a dry cough it indicates Lung Empty-Heat.
   Box 38.5 summarizes the pa erns underlying a feeling of heat in the chest.

            BOX 38.5        FEELING OF HEAT IN THE
         CHEST
            • Invasion of external Wind-Heat: aversion to cold, fever, sore
         throat
           • Heart-Fire: thirst, insomnia, palpitations, agitation, Red tip of
       the tongue
           • Heart Empty-Heat: insomnia, night sweating, feeling of heat
       in the evening, dry mouth at night, five-palm heat
           • Lung-Heat: cough, hot hands, red face
           • Lung Empty-Heat: dry cough, feeling of heat in the
       afternoon, night sweating, dry throat at night, five-palm heat

     Palpitations
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 63
   When we ask patients about palpitations it is important to explain to them
the meaning of this symptom, as most patients mistakenly identify ‘palpitations'
with tachycardia, that is, the pulse beating faster than normal. In reality,
palpitations are not related to the rate or speed of the pulse but simply indicate a
subjective and uncomfortable sensation of being aware of one's heartbeat.
   Palpitations are a symptom that is always related to the Heart and may
appear in any of the Heart pa erns.
   Palpitations with an acute onset may be due to external stimuli such as a
fright or an overwhelming emotional upset, in which case they are called ‘fright
palpitations' (Jing Ji ).
   Palpitations that extend upwards towards the chest and throat and
downwards towards the umbilicus and abdomen are called Zheng Chong , which
I translate as ‘panic palpitations' (literally it means ‘panic and anxiety'). This
type of palpitations is due to rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel aﬀecting the
Heart and is considered more severe than ordinary palpitations.
   Case history 38.2 illustrates a pa ern underlying palpitations.

                 Case History 38.2
           A 44-year-old woman had been suﬀering from palpitations for
       8 years. ‘Palpitations' was just a subjective symptom of a feeling of
       her heart thumping in her chest and was not associated with
       tachycardia. The palpitations were always worse before her
       period. She also complained of nausea and an epigastric pain,
       which was experienced just under the sternum, a sticky taste and
       a feeling of lump in the throat. She experienced a dry mouth
       occasionally, and occasionally suﬀered from tinnitus.
           Her periods were basically normal, coming every 4 weeks,
       lasting 6 days and they were not painful. The only problem
       associated with the periods was premenstrual tension.
           Her complexion was dull and sallow without lustre and her
       eyes were very dull and lacked lustre to an extreme degree.
          Her tongue was of a normal colour, except for a Red tip. It had
      a Heart crack and, although it could not be defined as being
      peeled, the coating was not suﬃcient. Her pulse was Fine on the
      right and Floating-Empty on the left.
          Diagnosis:
          The aggravation of the palpitations before the period, together
      with the nausea, epigastric pain under the sternum and the feeling
      of lump in the throat, indicate a condition of rebellious Qi in the
      Penetrating Vessel, as this vessel flows through the stomach,
      connects with the heart, traverses the chest and goes over the
      throat (on its way to the face).
          However, the pulse, being Fine on the right, and the dull-
      sallow complexion clearly show a condition of Blood deficiency,
      while the Floating-Empty nature of the pulse on the left side and
      the insuﬃcient coating on the tongue show the beginning of Yin
      deficiency (of the Liver, Kidneys and Heart). In this case,
      therefore, the condition of rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel
      is secondary to the condition of Blood and Yin deficiency; in other
      words, the Qi of the Penetrating Vessel rebels upward because
      there is a deficiency of Blood and Yin. In fact, the Penetrating
      Vessel is the Sea of Blood and it is therefore easily aﬀected by
      Blood deficiency. The treatment principle in this case, therefore,
      should be to nourish Blood and Yin (of the Heart and Liver)
      primarily and to subdue rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel
      secondarily.
          The Heart crack and the very dull appearance of the eyes
      indicate a disturbed Mind and a strong propensity to emotional
      problems.

     ABDOMEN
   Abdomen here refers to the area of the trunk between the diaphragm and the
symphysis pubis (see Fig 16.7 , p. 145 ).

     WHY WE ASK
   Abdominal symptoms are so frequent that it is absolutely crucial to ask about
them in every case, even if the patient presents with a problem in an entirely
diﬀerent area, (e.g. headaches). The abdomen readily reflects extremely common
pa erns such as Qi stagnation, Blood stasis and Dampness.

     WHEN WE ASK
   If the patient does not come specifically to consult about abdominal
symptoms, I generally ask about these immediately after asking about digestive
problems (related to the Stomach).

     HOW WE ASK
   It is important to be clear about the area involved because patients are often
vague about the location of their abdominal symptoms. For example, someone
might refer to the whole abdomen as the ‘stomach'. We should therefore always
make sure we ask the patient to point to the area involved.
   In the case of pain, we should first let patients describe the abdominal pain in
their own words; only then can we ask systematically about the reaction of pain
to pressure, application of heat and food or drinks in order to establish the Full
or Empty and the Hot or Cold character of the pain. When asking about the
reaction of their abdominal pain to ‘pressure', instead of simply asking ‘Is it
be er with pressure or not?', which the patient would not really understand, we
should ask, ‘When you have the pain, do you like to press the area of pain with
your hands, or do you dislike being touched?' We should then ask about the
reaction of the abdominal pain to exposure to heat or cold and to ingestion of hot
or cold drinks.
   Besides this, there is also a terminology problem since few patients will
actually use the term ‘distension' (often described as ‘bloating' in English), and
even fewer the term ‘stuﬃness'. The exact meaning of these symptoms is
described below.
   The discussion of abdominal symptoms will be centred first on the four most
common sensations experienced in the abdomen, which are:

          • distension
          • pain
          • fullness
          • stuﬃness.
   After this, the various abdominal symptoms will be discussed according to
areas (see Fig 16.7 on p. 145 ), which are:

          • the area under the xyphoid process (Xin Xia )
          • the epigastrium
          • the hypochondrium
          • the umbilical area
          • the central-lower abdominal area
          • the right-lateral and left-lateral lower abdominal area.

     Sensations
Distension
   Observation, Chapter 16 ; Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 71
   A feeling of abdominal distension or ‘bloating' is an extremely common
symptom. The following pa erns most commonly cause distension of the
abdomen (in order of frequency):

          • Qi stagnation - severe distension
          • Spleen-Qi deficiency - mild distension
          • Damp-Phlegm.
   Besides the subjective feeling of bloating, distension is also characterized by
an objective, distended, drum-like feeling on palpation.

          Remember : distension is a subjective feeling of bloating but it
      is also an objective sign of the abdomen, i.e. the abdomen feels
      distended like a drum on palpation.

     Pain
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 71
   Abdominal pain can be due to a very wide variety of conditions, some Full
and some Empty. By definition, the abdominal pain from a Full condition is
severe, whereas that from an Empty condition is mild. Among the Full
conditions that may cause abdominal pain are:

          • Qi stagnation
          • Blood stasis
          • Dampness
          • Retention of food
          • Cold.
   Among the Empty conditions are:

          • Spleen-Qi deficiency
          • Empty-Cold
          • Kidney deficiency.
   (For a detailed discussion of the pa erns causing abdominal pain in its
various areas, see Part 5 , Chapter 71 .)
   Abdominal pain is one of the most common presenting symptoms in practice.
When diagnosing such pain, it is important to refer to the basic principles, which
allow us to diﬀerentiate Fullness from Emptiness and Heat from Cold.
Abdominal pain that is alleviated by pressure indicates Deficiency, whereas if it
is aggravated by pressure or if the patient dislikes being touched in the area this
indicates Fullness. Abdominal pain that is alleviated by the application of heat
(such as a hot-water bo le) or by the ingestion of warm drinks indicates a Cold
condition, and the same if it is aggravated by exposure to cold or ingestion of
cold drinks. Abdominal pain that is aggravated by exposure to heat or by the
ingestion of warm drinks indicates a Heat condition, and the same if it is
alleviated by exposure to cold (which is very rare even in Heat conditions) or by
the ingestion of cold drinks.

     Fullness
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 71
   A feeling of fullness in the abdomen is usually caused by Dampness or
retention of food. Subjectively the patient feels full as if having had a large meal
and there is a very slight feeling of nausea; objectively the abdomen feels hard on
palpation.

          A subjective feeling of fullness is mirrored by an objective
      hardness of the abdomen on palpation.

     Stuffiness
   ‘Stuﬃness' is a translation of the Chinese term Pi (although this term has a
broader meaning than simply ‘feeling of stuﬃness'). A feeling of stuﬃness in the
abdomen is characterized by a subjective mild feeling of fullness, together with
an objective soft feeling of the abdomen on palpation. This symptom is usually
due to either Dampness or Heat occurring against a background of Deficiency.

          A feeling of stuﬃness is characterized by the contradiction
      between a subjective feeling of fullness and an objective, soft
      feeling to the abdomen on palpation.

     Areas Of Abdominal Pain
   Before establishing the Full or Empty and Hot or Cold nature of the condition
according to the abdominal symptoms, it is important to ask the patient to
identify clearly the location of the problem, which is most commonly pain.
Patients are often vague about the location of the pain and we should ask them
to pay a ention and be exact. This diﬃculty is particularly evident in children
who are often unable to identify the exact location of the abdominal pain.
   The regions of the abdomen in Chinese medicine are as follows (see Fig 16.7
on p. 145 ):

          • Area under the xyphoid process: this is the small area
      immediately below the xyphoid process extending approximately
      50 mm (2 inches) and bordered by the ribs. It is influenced by the
      Heart and Stomach channels and the Penetrating Vessel.
         • Epigastric: this is the area between the xyphoid process and
      the umbilicus but excluding the hypochondrial area. It is related to
      the Stomach and Spleen channels.
         • Hypochondrial: these are the two areas below the rib cage.
      This area is influenced by the Liver and Gall-Bladder channels.
         • Umbilical: this is the area around the umbilicus. It is
      influenced by the Spleen, Liver, Kidney and Small Intestine
      channels.
         • Central-lower abdominal (Xiao Fu ): this is the area between
      the umbilicus and the symphysis pubis. This area is influenced by
      the Liver, Kidney, Bladder and Large Intestine channels and by the
      Directing Vessel; in women, it is also influenced by the Uterus.
         • Right-lateral-lower abdominal and left-lateral-lower
      abdominal (Shao Fu ): these are the lateral areas of the lower
      abdomen. This area is influenced by the Liver and Large Intestine
      channels, and by the Penetrating Vessel.
   The diagnosis of abdominal problems, and especially abdominal pain, is
much more complex than with those of the epigastric region because of the large
number of channels involved. In women, it is even more complex because the
lower abdomen can reflect problems of all the above channels as well as those of
the Uterus and gynaecological system. In practice it is therefore often diﬃcult in
women to diﬀerentiate whether an abdominal pain is of intestinal or
gynaecological origin. This diﬃculty exists also in Western medicine. In Chinese
medicine, however, the distinction is less important than it is in Western
medicine as there is often an overlap between a pathology of the Intestines and
one of the gynaecological system. For example, in women stasis of Blood in the
lower abdomen may cause painful periods and an abdominal pain of intestinal
origin at the same time.
   Here I will discuss the most common pa erns and conditions diﬀerentiated
according to their location (i.e. the area under the xyphoid process, epigastrium,
hypochondrium, umbilical area, central-lower abdomen, right-lateral lower
abdomen and left-lateral lower abdomen). (For the diﬀerentiation of various
abdominal symptoms, see Part 5 , Chapter 71 .)

    Area under the xyphoid process
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 71
   The area under the xyphoid process extends approximately 50 mm (2 inches)
from the xyphoid process and is bordered by the ribs. It is influenced by the
Stomach, Heart and Penetrating Vessel channels and its symptomatology often
reflects emotional problems. In fact, this is an area that is very easily and
frequently aﬀected by emotional problems due to worry, fear, sadness or grief.
The symptoms related to this area may include a feeling of tightness, distension,
oppression, stuﬃness and palpitations depending on the channel and pathology
involved.
   The Penetrating Vessel has a strong influence on this area causing a feeling of
tightness; however, a pathology of the Penetrating Vessel can be diagnosed only
if the feeling of tightness in this area is associated with other abdominal or chest
sensations, such as lower abdominal fullness or pain, epigastric distension or
pain and chest oppression or tightness. A typical symptom of the Penetrating
Vessel in the area below the xyphoid is characterized by a feeling of ‘urgency',
anxiety and palpitations in that area. Occasionally, Western patients will
describe this Penetrating Vessel symptomatology in diﬀerent and unusual ways;
for example, in England, a patient may describe a feeling of ‘bu erflies' in this
area, of ‘heart cascading', ‘as if the stomach was having an argument with itself'
or ‘adrenaline rushing up and down the chest'. All these are symptoms related to
rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel along its course in the abdomen and chest
and aﬀecting the Heart and the region under the xyphoid process.
   In the absence of other Penetrating Vessel symptoms along its course,
symptoms in the area under the xyphoid are usually related to the Stomach or
Heart. The symptoms in this area should be closely integrated with palpation: a
hardness on palpation indicates a Full condition whereas a softness indicates an
Empty condition.
   A feeling of oppression in the area under the xyphoid process usually
indicates Phlegm or severe stagnation of Qi in the Heart and Stomach channel. A
feeling of fullness in this area indicates retention of food in the Stomach aﬀecting
the Heart; a feeling of stuﬃness in this area (i.e. the patient feels full but the area
is soft on palpation) indicates Stomach and Spleen deficiency with Heart-Heat. A
feeling of distension in this area indicates stagnation of Qi in the Stomach.
   On the pulse, this area can be felt on the distal end of the right Middle
position, by placing the finger on the Stomach position and rolling it distally
very slightly.
   Box 38.6 summarizes pa erns underlying pain in the area under the xyphoid
process.

            BOX 38.6        AREA UNDER THE XYPHOID
      PROCESS
            • Rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel: tightness and
      distension with anxiety and palpitations
            • Phlegm or severe Qi stagnation: feeling of oppression
            • Retention of food: feeling of fullness
            • Stomach and Spleen deficiency with Heart-Heat: feeling of
      stuﬃness
            • Stomach-Qi stagnation: feeling of distension

     Epigastrium
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 71
   This refers to the area between the xyphoid process and the umbilicus, but
excluding the hypochondrial area. The epigastrium is closely related to the
Stomach and Spleen channels and it reflects primarily Stomach pa erns, such as
Cold in the Stomach, Stomach-Heat, Stomach-Fire, Damp-Heat in the Stomach,
Stomach deficient and cold, Stomach-Yin deficiency, etc.
   In a patient presenting with an epigastric problem (which is usually pain or
distension) it is important to integrate questions about the character of the
epigastric pain with those about thirst, taste, nausea, belching and sour
regurgitation.
   The upper part of the epigastrium (i.e. the area just below the xyphoid
process) is influenced also by the Heart channel and in Chinese medicine there is
often an overlap and an interaction between the Stomach and the Heart channels
in certain pa erns. For example, rebellious Stomach-Qi causing nausea and
vomiting is often associated with rebellious Heart-Qi, that is, Heart-Qi not
descending so that the patient may have epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting,
belching, sour regurgitation but also palpitations and a discomfort that extends
from the epigastrium to the sternum area.
   However, epigastric pain is not always related to the Stomach channel and in
some cases the Chinese diagnosis of epigastric pain should be integrated with a
Western diagnosis. For example, when the Large Intestine is aﬀected by
stagnation of Qi and there is severe flatulence in the transverse colon, this may
cause an epigastric pain; in this case it would be wrong to a ribute the problem
to the Stomach channel simply because it occurs in the epigastric area. Of course,
in such a case there would be other symptoms such as lower abdominal pain,
constipation and small stools, which would point to the Large Intestine.
   There are many types of epigastric pain, as follows:

         • A spastic epigastric pain that is ameliorated by the
      application of heat and the ingestion of warm drinks indicates
      Full-Cold in the Stomach.
         • Epigastric pain with a pronounced feeling of fullness
      indicates retention of food, which is more common in children.
         • A distending epigastric pain radiating to the right or left
      hypochondrium indicates rebellious Liver-Qi invading the
      Stomach; this is a very common type of epigastric pain.
         • Burning epigastric pain denotes Stomach-Heat.
         • Burning epigastric pain with a feeling of heaviness, nausea
      and a feeling of oppression of the chest indicates Phlegm-Heat in
      the Stomach.
         • Burning epigastric pain with a feeling of heaviness, a sticky
      taste and a sticky yellow tongue coating denotes Damp-Heat in the
      Stomach.
         • A severe, stabbing epigastric pain indicates Blood stasis in
      the Stomach.
         • A chronic, intermi ent, dull ache that is ameliorated by the
      application of heat and the ingestion of warm drinks, and is
      aggravated by overwork, indicates Stomach deficient and cold.
         • A chronic, intermi ent, dull, slightly burning epigastric pain
      with a dry mouth indicates Stomach-Yin deficiency.
   Feelings of pain, distension, tightness or oppression of the epigastrium may
also be caused by rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel. However, such
epigastric sensations point to a Penetrating Vessel pathology only when they are
associated with other abdominal symptoms such as pain or distension in the
lower abdomen or umbilical pain.
   Interrogation about epigastric symptoms should be closely integrated with
investigation of the tongue and pulse.

    Epigastrium manifestation on the tongue
   On the tongue, the epigastric area is reflected either in the centre or on the
sides around the centre (see Fig 23.3 on p. 205 ). An examination of the coating in
this area is essential to distinguish Full from Empty conditions as a Full
condition will be reflected by a thick coating in this area and an Empty condition
by a rootless coating or the absence of coating. The coating in this area also
closely reflects the Hot or Cold nature of Stomach problems: a white coating
indicates Cold while a yellow (including brown) coating indicates Heat. The
thickness of the coating reflects the intensity of the pathogenic factor: the thicker
the coating, the more intense is the pathogenic factor.
   To summarize, when examining the coating in the Stomach area of the
tongue, we should establish systematically first whether there is a coating or not,
secondly the colour of the coating and thirdly the thickness of the coating. Some
Stomach pathologies are reflected in the central section of the tongue on the
sides; for example, Stomach-Heat often manifests with a redness in these areas.
Cracks in the central area are a very clear reflection of Stomach-Yin deficiency;
these may be small horizontal or vertical cracks or a wide, midline crack in the
central area. While small cracks in this area develop gradually from dietary
irregularities, a wide central midline Stomach crack may be hereditary and
indicate a tendency to develop Stomach-Yin deficiency.

    Epigastrium manifestation on the pulse
   With regard to the pulse, the right Middle position of course reflects closely
Stomach disharmonies. The most common pulse qualities in this position are
Slippery, Soggy, Floating-Empty and Wiry. A Slippery pulse in the
Stomach/Spleen position indicates retention of Dampness in the Stomach and
Spleen; a Soggy quality indicates Dampness occurring against a background of
Stomach and Spleen deficiency; a Floating-Empty pulse in this position indicates
Stomach-Yin deficiency; a Wiry pulse in this position denotes Stomach-Qi
stagnation, which may occur by itself or as a consequence of Liver-Qi stagnation
in which case the pulse would be Wiry in both Middle positions. An interesting
aspect of the Stomach pulse is its upper part, which is felt by rolling the finger
distally (towards the fingers) very slightly. This corresponds to the oesophagus
and if the pulse is Tight in this area it indicates rebellious Stomach-Qi or
stagnation of food in the upper part of the Stomach, which is often due to eating
too fast or eating when under pressure at work.
   Case history 38.3 illustrates a case of deficiency and rebellious Liver-Qi
causing epigastric pain.

               Case History 38.3
         A 42-year-old woman complained of indigestion, belching,
      acidity, sour regurgitation and epigastric distension. She had been
      suﬀering from this problem for several years. Her appetite was
      normal, there was no nausea and her stools were normal. Her
      complexion was dull and pale.
         Her tongue was Pale on the sides, slightly Swollen and very
      slightly lacking a coating in the centre. Her pulse was Weak and
      Choppy.
          Diagnosis:
         The digestive symptoms clearly suggest the condition of
      rebellious Liver-Qi invading the Stomach and preventing
      Stomach-Qi from descending, which causes the belching and sour
      regurgitation.   However,    the    tongue    and    pulse   show
      predominantly Deficiency and in particular, deficiency of Spleen-
      Qi (Weak pulse), a slight Stomach-Yin deficiency (lack of coating
      in the centre) and a Liver-Blood deficiency (Pale sides and
      Choppy pulse). In conditions of rebellious Liver-Qi invading the
      Stomach and Spleen, one can distinguish two situations: one
      when the primary problem is a disharmony of the Liver channel
      caused by emotional problems and the other when the primary
      problem is a weakness of the Stomach and Spleen, which ‘allow'
      themselves to be invaded by the Liver. In this case, the la er
      situation clearly applies. This distinction is important to
      determine the appropriate treatment principle because, in the first
      situation, the primary aim is to subdue rebellious Liver-Qi and the
      secondary one to tonify the Stomach and Spleen; in the second
      situation, the primary aim is to tonify the Stomach and Spleen and
      the secondary one to subdue rebellious Liver-Qi.
   Box 38.7 summarizes the pa erns underlying epigastric pain.
         BOX 38.7        EPIGASTRIC PAIN
         • Cold in the Stomach: spastic pain ameliorated by heat
         • Retention of food: pain with feeling of fullness
         • Rebellious Liver-Qi invading the Stomach: Distending pain
      radiating to the right or left hypochondrium
         • Stomach-Heat: burning, redness in centre of tongue
         • Phlegm-Heat in the Stomach: burning pain with feeling of
      heaviness and feeling of oppression of chest
         • Damp-Heat in the Stomach: pain with feeling of heaviness
      and sticky taste, sticky yellow tongue coating
         • Blood stasis in the Stomach: severe, stabbing pain
         • Stomach deficient and cold: chronic, intermi ent, dull ache
      ameliorated by heat and warm drinks, aggravated by cold
         • Stomach-Yin deficiency: chronic, intermi ent burning pain,
      dry mouth
         • Rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel: distension, tightness
      and pain radiating to abdomen/umbilicus/chest, anxiety

    Hypochondrium
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 71
   Most patients are not familiar with the word ‘hypochondrium'. Therefore
when I ask patients about symptoms in this area, I simply point to it. The
hypochondrial area includes the ribs and the area immediately below them on
both sides; this area is influenced by the Liver and Gall-Bladder channels and it
is important to note that the left hypochondrial area may also reflect Liver
disharmonies. Again, when patients report abdominal problems in this area, it is
important to identify the location exactly. If any pain is located only in the
hypochondrial region, it is definitely related to the Liver or Gall-Bladder
channels, or both; if the pain starts in the hypochondrial region and radiates
towards the centre of the epigastrium, it indicates rebellious Liver-Qi invading
the Stomach; if the pain starts in the centre of the epigastrium and radiates
towards either the right or left hypochondrium, it indicates a primary deficiency
of the Stomach with a secondary stagnation of Liver-Qi.
   Case history 38.4 illustrates a pa ern underlying hypochondrial pain.

              Case History 38.4
         A 49-year-old woman had been suﬀering from recurrent bouts
      of pain and discomfort in the right hypochondrium for the past 7
      years. The pain was sometimes sharp in nature and radiated to
      her shoulder.
         The patient also suﬀered from a feeling of muzziness in her
      head, lacked concentration and sometimes had diﬃculty finding
  her words. She had occasional dizzy spells in the mornings and
  also suﬀered from blurred vision and floaters. She often felt tired
  and her joints would ache, especially her left hip where she had
  had pain for a long time.
     The patient suﬀered from insomnia and often woke up
  between 3 am and 4 am. She used to suﬀer from colitis, with
  abdominal pain, mucus and blood in the stools and diarrhoea.
  This had been helped by acupuncture although she still had loose
  stools.
     She suﬀered from premenstrual breast distension and
  irritability. Her periods were becoming scantier and her left breast
  hurt after her period. She had several breast lumps.
     The tongue body was slightly Pale-Purple, with Red points
  and slightly Red sides. It was Swollen with teethmarks and had a
  sticky coating. Her pulse was Deep-Weak-Choppy and the left
  Front position was relatively Overflowing.
      Diagnosis:
     The hypochondrial pain is caused by Liver-Qi stagnation.
  Other symptoms of Liver-Qi stagnation are the premenstrual
  breast distension and irritability. Evidence of the long-standing
  and severe nature of the stagnation is shown by the tongue having
  a slightly Purple colour.
     The feeling of muzziness in the head, lack of concentration,
  diﬃculty in finding words, breast lumps and dizzy spells in the
  morning point towards the presence of Phlegm. This is confirmed
  by the Swollen tongue body and the sticky tongue coating.
     The underlying Deficiency which has led to the development
  of Phlegm is predominantly one of Spleen- and Kidney-Yang. This
  is causing the loose stools and tiredness and is reflected in the
  pulse, which is Deep and Weak, and on the tongue, which is
  Swollen with teethmarks.
     There is also a deficiency of Liver-Blood, manifesting with
  blurred vision, floaters, the periods becoming scantier, the
  Choppy quality of the pulse and the Pale colour of the tongue.
  The pain in the left breast occurring after the period indicates that,
  although it is due to Liver-Qi stagnation, there is an underlying
  Blood deficiency. Ache in the joints is normally due to Painful
  Obstruction Syndrome with Wind, Dampness or Cold; however,
  in women, ache in the joints without swelling is often caused
  simply by deficient Blood failing to nourish the sinews, as is the
  case in this patient.
Box 38.8 summarizes the pa erns underlying hypochondrial pain.
          BOX 38.8          HYPOCHONDRIAL PAIN
          • Liver and Gall-Bladder channels: hypochondrial pain or
      distension
          • Stagnant Liver-Qi invading the stomach: hypochondrial pain
      radiating to centre
          • Stomach deficiency with secondary Liver-Qi stagnation:
      epigastric pain radiating to right or left hypochondrial region

     Umbilical area
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 71
   The umbilical area is influenced by the Kidney and Liver channels and by the
Directing and Penetrating Vessel. Pain in this area is more common in children
than in adults.
   The most common pa erns causing umbilical pain are:

          • Cold in the abdomen
          • Qi stagnation
          • Blood stasis
          • retention of food (more common in children).

     Central-lower abdominal area
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 71
   The central-lower abdominal area is influenced by many diﬀerent channels:
the Kidney, Liver, Bladder, Small Intestine, Directing Vessel, Penetrating Vessel
and the Uterus itself. Pain in this area is therefore often diﬃcult to diagnose
because of the involvement of so many diﬀerent channels; and the diﬃculties are
compounded in women because of the influence of the Uterus on this area.
   The most common pa erns causing problems in this area are:

          • stagnation of Qi - producing a pronounced feeling of
      distension or distending pain
          • stasis of Blood - producing a fixed, severe and stabbing pain
          • Dampness - producing a feeling of heaviness.
   Apart from identifying the pa ern, it is of course necessary to identify the
channel involved and this is done according to the accompanying symptoms. In
the case of the Bladder, there will be some urinary symptoms; in the case of the
Uterus, there will be some menstrual irregularities; in the case of the Small
Intestine, there will be borborygmi, loose stools or constipation; in the case of the
Liver, there will be a pronounced distension and a clear correlation of the
abdominal problem with the emotional state.
   Case history 38.5 illustrates a pa ern of Blood stasis and Deficiency causing
central-lower abdominal pain.
           Case History 38.5
   A 31-year-old woman complained of abdominal pain
following a dilatation and cure age operation on her uterus. Ten
months previously she had had an exploratory laparoscopy for a
suspected ovarian cyst; she developed complications after this
operation with an infection of the scar and a haematoma in the
abdomen. Three months after that she had a termination of
pregnancy; as she developed complications, she was advised to
have a dilatation and cure age of her womb. Following these
procedures she developed a constant, sharp lower abdominal
pain, pain on intercourse and mid-cycle bleeding, and her
menstrual blood became dark with clots. Before all this happened,
her periods were painful but not dark and without any mid-cycle
bleeding.
   Apart from the above problem, she also complained of a
pronounced tiredness and, on interrogation, it transpired that she
suﬀered from floaters in the afternoon, tingling of her limbs, poor
memory and dizziness. She also complained of lower backache,
which she a ributed to riding, and the occasional tinnitus. She felt
cold in general and suﬀered from cold hands and feet. She
occasionally also suﬀered from a slight pain in the chest with a
feeling of palpitations and breathlessness, for which she used an
inhaler.
   Her complexion was rather pale and the shen of her eyes was
bright. Her voice sounded clear but with a very subtle tone of
sadness to it. Her tongue was Pale in general with paler sides,
Swollen, with a Stomach crack and a rootless coating on the root.
Her pulse was Weak and Choppy and particularly Weak on both
Rear positions; the Heart position was also particularly Choppy.
    Diagnosis:
   In diagnosis, we must diﬀerentiate the diagnosis of her
present, acute problem (abdominal pain, dyspareunia and mid-
cycle bleeding following the dilatation and cure age) from that of
her underlying condition. The present problem of abdominal pain
is clearly due to Blood stasis; this is clearly shown by the
sharpness of the pain and the darkness of the menstrual blood
with clots. The tongue does not show any Blood stasis (as it is not
Purple) owing to the relatively short duration of this problem.
   The underlying condition is characterized primarily by three
problems:
   1. Blood deficiency (Pale tongue, floaters, tiredness, tingling,
poor memory and dizziness): there is Blood deficiency of the Liver
  but also of the Heart, as is evidenced by the palpitations,
  breathlessness and the Choppy pulse on the Heart position.
      2. Stomach and Spleen deficiency with some aﬄiction of the
  Intestines: the Spleen deficiency is manifested clearly by the
  swelling of the sides of the tongue and the tiredness. The Stomach
  deficiency is manifested by the Stomach crack and the rootless
  coating: the fact that the rootless coating is on the root of the
  tongue shows that there is an intestinal pathology. It was only
  after I pointed this out to her that she told that she had also just
  been diagnosed as suﬀering from intestinal parasites.
      3. Kidney-Yang deficiency: this is manifested by lower
  backache, feeling cold, cold feet and hands and occasional tinnitus.
      As for possible aetiology, I ventured to say that in my opinion
  the main origin of the problem was emotional. I based this
  primarily on the Choppiness of the pulse (especially on the Heart
  pulse) and its lack of wave, which is usually due to sadness. As I
  told her that I thought sadness was the main origin of the
  problem, she confirmed this by saying that she had been
  repeatedly sexually abused as a child. I think this was the
  emotional cause for the Blood deficiency (especially of the Heart)
  and also of the Kidney deficiency as the sexual abuse was
  obviously accompanied by fear, which injured the Kidneys.
  Besides being sexually abused she was also frequently beaten
  across the lower back; I think that that, rather than riding, was the
  cause of the lower backache.
      Treatment:
      In treatment, one must concentrate on the present, acute
  problem of Blood stasis in the abdomen with a formula to
  invigorate Blood and eliminate stasis such as Sheng Hua Tang
  Generating and Transforming Decoction ; this is a formula for
  abdominal pain from Blood stasis after childbirth. The termination
  and   dilatation   and    cure age    are   somewhat      energetically
  equivalent to childbirth (without, of course, the pronounced
  depletion of Qi and Blood that follows childbirth).
Box 38.9 summarizes the pa erns underlying pain in this area.

  PAIN
      • Bladder Damp-Heat: pain with frequent and diﬃcult
  urination
      • Blood stasis or Damp-Heat in the Uterus: pain during the
  periods, menstrual irregularities
         • Damp-Heat in the Small Intestine: pain with borborygmi and
      loose stools or constipation
         • Liver-Qi stagnation: distending pain aggravated by
      emotional stress

    Right-lateral lower abdominal area
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 71
   This area is influenced primarily by the Large Intestine and Liver channels
and by the Penetrating Vessel. As a rule of thumb, problems in this area are
caused by the gynaecological system more often than by the Large Intestine. For
example, in women, pain in this area is very often due to ovarian cysts.
   The most common pa erns causing pain in this area are:

         • stagnation of Qi - producing distension or distending pain,
      or both
         • stasis of Blood - producing a fixed, severe, stabbing pain
      with a feeling of mass
         • Dampness - accompanied by a feeling of heaviness
         • Cold - producing a severe, spastic pain that is alleviated by
      the application of heat.

    Left-lateral lower abdominal area
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 71
   This area is influenced by the Large Intestine, Liver and Spleen channels and
by the Penetrating Vessel. As a rule of thumb, compared with the right-lower
abdominal region, problems in this area are often caused by the pathology of the
Large Intestine. The most common pa erns causing problems in this area are the
same as those of the right-lateral lower abdominal area, that is:

         • stagnation of Qi - producing distension or distending pain,
      or both
         • stasis of Blood - producing a fixed, severe, stabbing pain
      with a feeling of mass
         • Dampness - accompanied by a feeling of heaviness
         • Cold - producing a severe, spastic pain that is alleviated by
      the application of heat.

    INTRODUCTION
   This chapter deals with symptoms that may occur either in the arms or in the
legs, or in all four limbs. Apart from the obvious influence of each channel on the
limb it traverses, the four limbs are influenced primarily by the Spleen and
Stomach in general.

    WHY WE ASK
   Generally speaking, questions about the four limbs are asked only when the
patient presents with a problem specific to them. The main exceptions to this are
when a patient presents with symptoms of Blood deficiency, in which case I
always ask about numbness of the limbs, or when a patient has symptoms of
Dampness, in which case I ask about any feeling of heaviness in the limbs.

    WHEN WE ASK
   I generally ask about problems in the limbs when the patient presents with a
specific problem such as oedema, numbness or weakness of the limbs.
   I also ask about the limbs in three other situations. When I suspect a
Stomach-Qi deficiency I ask about weakness of the limbs, when I suspect a
Kidney deficiency I ask about weakness of the knees, and when I suspect Phlegm
or a Blood deficiency I ask about numbness or tingling of the limbs.

    HOW WE ASK
   When we ask about the limbs, we should make it clear that we mean all four
limbs - that is, whether the patient has a problem such as weakness, heaviness or
numbness of all limbs.

    WEAKNESS OF THE LIMBS
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapters 64 and 66
   The three most common causes of weakness of the limbs are Stomach-Qi
deficiency, a general Qi and Blood deficiency and a deficiency of Kidney-Yang.
The Stomach carries the food essences to the four limbs and for this reason a
weakness of Stomach-Qi is the most common cause of a feeling of weakness of
the limbs. The Kidneys carry food essences and Blood to the legs; a weakness of
the limbs in the elderly is more likely to be due to a Kidney deficiency.
   Box 39.1 summarizes the pa erns underlying weakness of the limbs.

           BOX 39.1       WEAKNESS OF LIMBS
           • Stomach-Qi deficiency
           • Qi and Blood deficiency
           • Kidney-Yang deficiency

  DIFFICULTY IN WALKING
(ATROPHY/FLACCIDITY OF LIMBS
   Observation, Chapter 18 ; Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 64
   Atrophy or flaccidity of the limbs causes a diﬃculty in walking; the most
common example of this in Western patients is multiple sclerosis.
   In the beginning stages, atrophy or flaccidity of the limbs is often due to a
Stomach- and Spleen-Qi deficiency, failing to carry food essences to the limbs. In
later stages, atrophy or flaccidity of the limbs, or both, is often due to a Yin
deficiency of the Liver and Kidneys or a Yang deficiency of the Spleen and
Kidneys.
   Atrophy or flaccidity of the limbs in children is due to a deficiency of Kidney-
Essence. A general deficiency of Qi and Blood may also cause atrophy or
flaccidity of the limbs.
   Box 39.2 summarizes the pa erns underlying diﬃculty in walking.

           BOX 39.2       DIFFICULTY IN WALKING
           • Stomach- and Spleen-Qi deficiency
           • Liver- and Kidney-Yin deficiency
           • Spleen- and Kidney-Yang deficiency
           • Qi and Blood deficiency
           • Deficiency of Kidney-Essence (in children)

     FEELING OF DISTENSION OF THE LIMBS
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 64
   The five most common causes of a feeling of distension of the limbs are:

           • Qi stagnation
           • Qi stagnation with Dampness
           • Blood stasis from Qi deficiency
           • Wind-Phlegm
           • Dampness in the muscles.
   Qi stagnation causes a feeling of distension of the limbs, particularly in the
hands and feet.
   If the feeling of distension of the limbs is accompanied by a swelling under
the skin and a sallow complexion, then it is due to Qi stagnation with Dampness.
It should be noted that this swelling is not real oedema and finger pressure does
not leave a dip in the skin. This type of distension and swelling of the limbs is
very common in women suﬀering from premenstrual syndrome.
   If the feeling of distension of the limbs is aggravated by overexertion and the
lower legs have a purple colour, it is due to Blood stasis deriving from Qi
deficiency.
   If the feeling of distension of the limbs is accompanied by numbness,
tingling, a feeling of heaviness and tremor, it is due to Wind-Phlegm.
   A feeling of distension of the limbs may also be due to retention of Dampness
in the muscles, which may be associated with Cold or Heat; in this case, there
would also be a feeling of heaviness of the limbs.
   Box 39.3 summarizes the pa erns underlying a feeling of distension of the
limbs.

                BOX 39.3       FEELING OF DISTENSION OF
         THE LIMBS
            • Qi stagnation: feeling of distension especially in hands and
         feet
            • Qi stagnation with Dampness: feeling of distension with
         swelling, sallow complexion
            • Blood stasis from Qi deficiency: feeling of distension with
         weakness, purple colour of legs, aggravated by overwork
            • Wind-Phlegm: feeling of distension, numbness, tingling,
         feeling of heaviness, tremor
            • Dampness: feeling of distension and heaviness

     FEELING OF HEAVINESS OF THE LIMBS
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapters 64 and 66
   Patients quite often spontaneously report a sensation of heaviness of the
limbs although they may not necessarily use such terms. They often say that
their legs ‘feel like lead'.
   A feeling of heaviness of the limbs is more frequently experienced in the legs.
A feeling of heaviness of the legs is always due to Dampness in the Lower
Burner. The Dampness may be combined with Heat or Cold, and it may be Full
or Empty. The feeling of heaviness from Full-Dampness is more pronounced
than that from Dampness associated with Spleen-Qi deficiency.
   When the Spleen-Qi deficiency is associated with Stomach-Qi deficiency, the
feeling of heaviness is frequently experienced in all four limbs rather than just
the legs. Similarly, when Phlegm causes a feeling of heaviness, it is experienced
in all four limbs.

     MUSCLE ACHE IN THE LIMBS
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 64
   Muscle ache in the limbs is nearly always due to retention of Dampness in the
space between skin and muscles. This may be a Full or an Empty condition
(associated with Spleen-Qi deficiency) and the Dampness may or may not be
combined with Heat. If it is combined with Heat, the ache is more intense. In
addition to the ache, there is a pronounced feeling of heaviness of the limbs. In a
few cases, muscle ache in the limbs may be due to Liver-Blood deficiency, in
which case it would be very mild and associated with tingling.
   Muscle ache in the limbs is a common symptom in postviral fatigue
syndrome.

     NUMBNESS/TINGLING OF THE LIMBS
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 64
   ‘Numbness' here includes tingling in the limbs. Generally speaking, a feeling
of numbness/tingling may be due to:

          • Wind
          • Phlegm
          • Dampness or Damp-Heat
          • stagnation of Qi and Blood.
   Blood deficiency usually causes tingling, whereas Phlegm and Wind tend to
cause more numbness: with Wind, the numbness is often unilateral. However,
these are only general rules.
   Blood deficiency is a common cause of numbness/tingling of the limbs in
younger people, especially women. In the elderly, a numbness of the limbs is
very often caused by Wind or Wind-Phlegm obstructing the channels and, in the
case of Wind, the numbness is often unilateral. Dampness or Damp-Heat may
also cause numbness of the limbs and especially of the legs. In a few cases,
numbness may be caused by stagnation of Qi and Blood in the limbs, in which
case it is relieved by exercise.
   Box 39.4 summarizes the pa erns underlying numbness/tingling of the limbs.

           BOX 39.4         NUMBNESS/TINGLING OF THE
      LIMBS
          • Blood deficiency: more tingling, common in women
          • Wind: more numbness, often unilateral, common in the
      elderly
          • Phlegm: more numbness, with feeling of heaviness
          • Dampness or Damp-Heat: numbness especially of legs, with
      swelling
          • Stagnation of Qi and Blood: with pain, relieved by exercise

     GENERALIZED JOINT PAIN
   Pain in multiple joints is generally due to Wind (Wind Painful Obstruction
Syndrome) combined with Dampness or Cold, or both. If the site of the pain
moves, aﬀecting diﬀerent joints every day, this strongly indicates Wind. A severe
pain indicates Cold, whereas swelling of the joints indicates Dampness. In
chronic conditions, Dampness frequently combines with Heat and causes
swelling, redness and heat of the joints.
   Generalized joint pain may also be caused by Qi stagnation; in this case, the
pain is alleviated by gentle exercise. Blood stasis may also cause generalized
joint pain; in this case, the pain is intense and often worse at night. Finally, a
general deficiency of Qi and Blood may cause a dull, mild joint ache that
improves with rest.
   Case history 39.1 illustrates a pa ern underlying generalized joint pain.

                 Case History 39.1
          A 50-year-old woman had been suﬀering from osteoarthritis
      for the past year. There had been a sudden onset of the condition
      after the patient had suﬀered a severe shock. The pain, which was
      stabbing in nature, had first aﬀected the elbow, shoulder and
      neck; however, it spread to all the other joints after the patient was
      put in neck traction. The joints were not swollen. The patient said
      she felt like she ‘was being crushed inside'. The pain was
      alleviated by taking a hot bath and made worse by damp or cold
      weather and stress.
          She had had four children. During her first pregnancy, she
      suﬀered from repeated kidney infections; during her third
      pregnancy she developed asthma; during her fourth pregnancy
      she developed a pre-eclampsia condition with high blood
      pressure. Her blood pressure had remained high ever since and
      she was on medication for this.
          The patient had a tendency towards constipation and said that
      she had no energy. She started taking hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) 5 years previously, after suﬀering from hot flushes,
      lethargy and mood swings. She had continued to suﬀer from
      recurrent kidney infections since her first pregnancy.
      The tongue body was Reddish-Purple, Swollen and with
  cracks in the Stomach and Spleen area. The tongue coating was
  very thin. The pulse was Slippery in general and Weak in both
  Rear positions.
      Diagnosis:
      The widespread and moving joint pain, which is aggravated
  by exposure to damp and cold weather, indicates Painful
  Obstruction Syndrome from Wind and Cold. Wind is indicated by
  the moving pain, while Cold is indicated by the intensity of the
  pain and its aggravation from exposure to cold. The absence of
  swelling of the joints indicates that there is no pronounced
  Dampness.
      The stabbing joint pain is caused by Blood stasis in the
  channels which was brought on by the sudden shock the patient
  experienced just prior to the onset of the symptoms. Being put in
  neck traction, with the consequent restriction of movement, would
  have only exacerbated the Blood stasis. Blood stasis is obvious
  from the Purple colour of the tongue body and the stabbing
  nature of the joint pain. The hypertension is caused by Kidney
  deficiency and retention of Phlegm, which itself has come about as
  a result of the long-standing Kidney deficiency and which is
  evidenced by the Swollen tongue and Slippery pulse.
      There   is    an   underlying   Kidney    deficiency,   which    is
  predominantly a deficiency of Kidney-Yin. This probably
  originated during her first pregnancy at the age of 16 when she
  suﬀered from kidney problems, and was exacerbated by her third
  pregnancy which was when she developed asthma, and further
  aggravated during the fourth pregnancy when she developed a
  pre-eclampsia condition. Other signs and symptoms of Kidney-
  Yin deficiency are the hot flushes the patient suﬀered before going
  on HRT, the tendency towards constipation, and the lack of
  tongue coating.
      I interpreted the expression she used ‘feeling like being
  crushed inside' as strongly suggestive of the emotional origin
  (shock) of her problem.
Box 39.5 summarizes the pa erns underlying generalized joint pain.

      BOX 39.5           GENERALIZED JOINT PAIN
      • Wind: pain moving from joint to joint
      • Cold: severe pain
      • Dampness: dull ache with swelling of joints
      • Damp-heat: chronic ache and swelling of joints
      • Qi stagnation: pain in the joints that is alleviated by exercise
          • Blood stasis: severe pain, often worse at night
          • Qi and Blood deficiency: generalized mild ache that is be er
      with rest

     TREMOR OF THE LIMBS
   Observation, Chapters 4 and 18 ; Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 64
   A tremor of the limbs always indicates Liver-Wind; we should therefore
establish the source of Liver-Wind and whether it is Full- or Empty-Wind. The
root cause of Liver-Wind may be Heat during an acute febrile disease, Liver-Fire,
Liver-Yang rising, a deficiency of Yin of the Liver or Kidneys, or both, and Liver-
Blood deficiency. The last two types of Wind are of the Empty type, whereas all
the others are of the Full type.
   Full Wind is characterized by pronounced tremors or convulsions (during an
acute febrile disease), vertigo, unilateral numbness and a Wiry pulse. Empty -
Wind is characterized by fine tremors or tics, mild dizziness, tingling and a
Choppy or Fine and slightly Wiry pulse.
   The tongue indicating Liver-Wind may be Moving, Deviated or Stiﬀ.
   Case histories 39.2 and 39.3 illustrate tremor caused by Liver-Wind.

               Case History 39.2
          A 45-year-old man had been suﬀering from a fine tremor of his
      right arm for 3 years. He had seen a neurologist who excluded the
      diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. This patient had very few other
      symptoms, complaining only of a feeling of heat in the head, cold
      hands and feet, floaters, an occasional itch in the left eye and
      occasional heat and dryness in both eyes. His skin was also rather
      dry and he had been suﬀering from myopia from the age of 8.
          His body type was a mixture of Metal and Wood. His tongue
      was slightly Thin, Red on the sides and not enough coating in the
      centre. His pulse was slightly Wiry on the left and Weak on the
      right, most of all on the Lung position.
          Diagnosis:
          The tremor of the arm is an unmistakable sign of Liver-Wind
      and we should establish the root pa ern giving rise to Wind. In
      this case, it is Liver-Blood and Liver-Yin deficiency. The
      symptoms of Liver-Blood deficiency are floaters, itch of the left
      eye, dry skin, myopia from childhood, Weak pulse on the right,
      while dryness of the eyes and the lack of coating on the tongue
      indicate Liver-Yin deficiency. There are also some symptoms of
      Liver-Yang rising (feeling of heat in the head and eyes, Red sides
      of the tongue) and of Liver-Qi stagnation (cold hands and feet).
      The Wiry pulse may be related to any of the Full Liver pa erns. In
      Liver disharmonies, it is not unusual to have a combination of
      several diﬀerent pa erns.
         There are no symptoms or signs corresponding to the
      weakness of the Lung pulse, which is not unusual for this organ.
      When the Lung pulse is the weakest of all the pulse positions, I
      usually relate this to emotional problems due to sadness and grief.

               Case History 39.3
         A 45-year-old woman had been suﬀering from a fine tremor of
      the left arm for 1 year. She also experienced numbness and
      tingling of the left arm. She had very few other symptoms, except
      for her periods being quite scanty.
         Her tongue was Pale and slightly Thin and her pulse was Fine
      and Wiry.
          Diagnosis:
         This is a clear example of Empty-Wind deriving from Blood
      deficiency. The Blood deficiency is evident from the Pale and Thin
      tongue and Fine pulse, while the Wind is evident from the Wiry
      pulse and obviously the tremor of the arm.
   Box 39.6 summarizes the pa erns of Liver-Wind.

          BOX 39.6        LIVER-WIND
         • Full type: pronounced tremors, convulsions, vertigo,
      unilateral numbness of a limb, Wiry pulse
         • Empty type: fine tremors, tics, mild dizziness, tingling of
      limbs, Choppy or Fine and slightly Wiry pulse

    UPPER LIMBS
Pain And Inability To Raise The Shoulder
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 65
   Inability to raise the shoulder, which is nearly always accompanied by pain
in the shoulder, is a very common complaint, especially after the age of 40.
   The most common cause of inability to raise the shoulder is chronic retention
of Cold in the joint owing to successive exposures to cold and damp weather;
this syndrome falls under the category of Painful Obstruction Syndrome. In this
case the pain is worse with rest and be er with exercise, aggravated by exposure
to cold and alleviated by exposure to heat and by wearing warm clothes.
   Another common cause of this problem is sprain of the shoulder joint, which
leads to local stagnation of Qi and Blood; in this case the pain is be er with
gentle exercise and worse with rest.
   In old people, chronic inability to raise the shoulder is often due to local
Blood stasis and this may be a consequence of chronic retention of Cold or
repetitive strain. In this case, the inability to raise the shoulder is very
pronounced and there is severe pain and stiﬀness that are worse at night.
   In rare cases, an inability to raise the shoulder accompanies Chest Painful
Obstruction Syndrome, in which case the patient suﬀers from chest pain,
breathlessness and palpitations.
   Box 39.7 summarizes the pa erns underlying pain and inability to raise the
shoulder.

            BOX 39.7        PAIN AND INABILITY TO
      RAISE THE SHOULDER
            • Cold in the joint: Painful Obstruction Syndrome pain be er
      with exercise, worse with rest, aggravated by cold, ameliorated by
      warmth
            • Stagnation of Qi and Blood: pain be er with exercise, worse
      with rest
            • Local Blood stasis: severe pain and stiﬀness, worse at night
            • General Blood stasis: Chest Painful Obstruction Syndrome
      (Chest Bi ) with breathlessness, palpitations

    Pain In The Elbow
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 65
   Pain in the elbow is usually due either to retention of Cold or to local
stagnation of Qi and Blood due to repetitive strain injury. In the case of retention
of Cold, the pain is severe and is aggravated by exposure to cold and alleviated
by the application of heat. In the case of stagnation of Qi and Blood, the pain is
aggravated by rest and slightly ameliorated by movement.
   Box 39.8 summarizes pa erns underlying elbow pain.

            BOX 39.8        PAIN IN THE ELBOW
            • Retention of Cold: severe pain aggravated by cold and
      ameliorated by warmth
            • Stagnation of Qi and Blood: pain ameliorated by exercise

    Pain In The Hands
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 65
   Pain in the hands may be of a Full or Empty nature: in Full conditions the
pain is severe, whereas in Empty conditions it is dull.
   The three most common causes are retention of Cold, Dampness or Wind (or
a combination of these) in the hands; this falls under the category of Painful
Obstruction Syndrome. When the hand pain is due to Cold, it is intense,
aggravated by exposure to cold and alleviated by application of heat. When it is
due to Dampness, there is swelling of the fingers. When due to Wind, the pain in
the hands is usually associated with pain in other joints.
   Pain in the hands may also be due to Liver-Qi stagnation, in which case it
may be accompanied by pain in the feet. In chronic cases, Qi stagnation will lead
to Blood stasis and this may cause a severe pain in the fingers, which is worse at
night, and a pronounced stiﬀness in them.
   Blood deficiency may cause a dull ache in the hands. This is due to deficient
Blood not reaching the hands and causing a minor local stagnation; it is more
common in women. Yang deficiency may also cause a dull ache in the hands,
similar to Blood deficiency, and, in addition, the hands have a pronounced cold
feeling.
   Box 39.9 summarizes the pa erns underlying hand pain.

           BOX 39.9       PAIN IN THE HANDS
           • Severe hand pain aggravated by cold: Cold Painful
      Obstruction Syndrome
           • Hand pain with swelling: Damp Painful Obstruction
      Syndrome
           • Pain in the hands and other joints: Wind Painful Obstruction
      Syndrome
           • Hand pain with swelling and heat: Damp-Heat in the joints
           • Pain in the hands and feet: Liver-Qi stagnation
           • Severe pain in the hands and fingers that is worse at night
      and with stiﬀness: Blood stasis
           • Dull ache in the hands: Blood deficiency
           • Dull ache in the hands ameliorated by heat, cold hands: Yang
      deficiency

     Cold Hands
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 65
   Cold hands are due to three possible causes: Yang deficiency (the most
common one), Blood deficiency and Qi stagnation.
   Yang deficiency causing cold hands is most commonly of the Spleen, Lungs
or Heart; it is ameliorated by the application of heat. Blood deficiency, especially
of the Heart, may also cause cold hands; it is accompanied by palpitations and
dizziness, and is more frequent in women. Liver-Qi stagnation may also cause
cold hands but in conjunction with cold feet; this is called the ‘Four Rebellious
Syndrome' in which the ‘four rebellious' indicate cold hands and feet. The
famous formula Si Ni San Four Rebellious Powder is used for this pa ern. An
important diﬀerence between cold limbs due to Yang deficiency and cold limbs
due to Qi stagnation is that in the former case the whole limb will be cold,
whereas in the la er case only the hands and feet, particularly the fingers and
toes, are cold.
   In the case of deficiency of Yang or Blood, the cold feeling is due to deficient
Yang-Qi or Blood not reaching the extremities; in the case of Liver-Qi stagnation,
Qi does not reach the extremities because it stagnates in the body.
   Box 39.10 summarizes the pa erns underlying cold hands.

          BOX 39.10         COLD HANDS
          • Dull ache in the hands ameliorated by heat, cold hands: Yang
      deficiency
          • Cold hands with palpitations and dizziness: Heart-Blood
      deficiency
          • Cold fingers and toes: Liver-Qi stagnation

     Hot Hands
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 65
   To diagnose the significance of hot hands, we must first of all diﬀerentiate
between exterior and interior syndromes. In exterior syndromes due to invasion
of Wind, the dorsum of the hands feels hot to the touch while the patient feels
cold, and an aversion to cold, in general. The acute onset, simultaneous
subjective cold feeling of the patient (to the point of shivering) and the objective
feeling of heat in the dorsum of the hands characterize the initial stages of an
invasion of Wind.
   In interior conditions, hot hands are due to either Full- or Empty-Heat
usually of the Lungs, Heart or Stomach. In Full-Heat the whole hand feels hot,
whereas in Empty-Heat especially the palms feel hot.
   Box 39.11 summarizes the pa erns underlying hot hands.

          B O X 3 9 . 11   HOT HANDS
          • Hot dorsum of the hands with acute onset and aversion to
      cold: invasion of external Wind
          • Chronic hot dorsum of the hands: Full-Heat (Lungs, Heart or
      Stomach)
          • Chronic hot palms: Empty-Heat (Lungs or Heart)

     Itchy Hands
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 64
   A common cause of itchiness of the hands is Dampness, which may be
associated with Heat. With Dampness, the itchiness of the hands is associated
with a swelling of the fingers and often small, white vesicles; with Damp-Heat
the itching is more intense and is associated with swelling and redness of the
fingers.
   Another possible cause of itchiness of the hands is Blood deficiency leading
to Wind in the skin.
   Box 39.12 summarizes the pa erns underlying itchy hands.

           BOX 39.12        ITCHY HANDS
          • Dampness: with white vesicles
          • Damp-Heat: intense itching
          • Blood deficiency with Wind in the skin: mild itching

     Numbness/Tingling Of The Hands
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 65
   When asking patients about numbness, it is important to explain to them that
this includes any feeling of tingling (in Britain often called ‘pins and needles').
   Causes of numbness or tingling of the hands include:

          • Blood deficiency
          • Phlegm
          • Qi and Blood stagnation
          • Wind.
   Blood deficiency is a common cause of numbness/tingling of the hands,
especially tingling. Phlegm may also cause numbness/tingling of the hands and
especially numbness. Another less common cause of numbness/tingling of the
hands is chronic Qi and Blood stagnation. Unilateral numbness or tingling of the
first three fingers in an old person may indicate the possibility of impending
Wind-stroke.

     Oedema Of The Hands
   Observation, Chapter 18 ; Symptoms and Signs, Chapters 64 and 65
   Oedema of the hands may be due to Lung-Yang deficiency or Spleen-Yang
deficiency; in this case the oedema is pi ing. If the oedema is not pi ing it is due
to Qi stagnation.

     LOWER LIMBS
Pain In The Hip
   Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 66
   The most common cause of hip pain is invasion of Cold and Dampness in the
hip joint, in which case the pain is unilateral, severe in nature and with marked
rigidity of the joint.
   In the elderly, hip pain is often due to chronic stagnation of Qi and stasis of
Blood aﬀecting the Gall-Bladder channel.

    Pain In The Thigh
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 66
   Pain in the thigh may be due to retention of Dampness in the muscles which
may be associated with Heat or Cold; in this case, the pain radiates to the groin.
   Chronic thigh pain may also be due to Qi deficiency with Blood stasis, or to
Kidney-Yang deficiency.

    Pain In The Knees
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 66
   The most common cause of pain in the knees is invasion of Cold and this falls
under the category of Painful Obstruction Syndrome. Invasion of Cold in the
knee causes a severe pain, which is usually unilateral, and rigidity. Cold is often
associated with Dampness, in which case the knee is also swollen. When
Dampness is retained for a long time it may transform into Damp-Heat, in which
case the knee is painful, swollen and hot.
   Another common cause of pain in the knee is sprain due to working
conditions, which usually causes local stagnation of Qi and Blood. It is
ameliorated by gentle exercise.
   Dull knee ache which improves with rest, has a gradual onset and is
associated with weakness of the knees is due to Kidney deficiency.
   Box 39.13 summarizes the pa erns underlying knee pain.

             BOX 39.13     PAIN IN THE KNEES
         • Invasion of Cold: severe pain with rigidity, usually unilateral
         • Damp-Cold: pain and swelling
         • Damp-Heat: pain, swelling and hot to the touch
         • Stagnation of Qi and Blood: be er with exercise
         • Kidney deficiency: chronic ache of gradual onset, be er with
      rest

    Weak Knees
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 66
   The most common cause of weak knees is a deficiency of the Kidneys. A
chronic deficiency of Stomach and Spleen may also cause a weakness of the
knees.

    Cramps In The Calves
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 66
   The most common cause of cramps in the calves is Liver-Blood deficiency.
This symptom is more common in the elderly and it frequently occurs at night. If
the cramps are very severe and are accompanied by numbness of the legs, this
may indicate the presence of Empty-Wind stemming from Liver-Blood
deficiency.
   Cramps in the calves may also be caused by a combination of Wind and
Phlegm in the limbs and this generally occurs only in patients over 70 years of
age. If cramps in the calves are accompanied by pain, this indicates that, in
addition to Liver-Blood deficiency, there is also Liver-Blood stasis.

     Cold Feet
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 66
   The most common cause of cold feet is Kidney-Yang deficiency; indeed, this
symptom is a relatively important one to diagnose a Kidney-Yang deficiency.
Another possible cause of cold feet, especially in women, is Liver-Blood
deficiency.
   Obstruction of Phlegm in the Lower Burner may also cause the feet to be
cold.

     Pain In The Feet
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 66
   By ‘pain in the foot', we mean a localized pain, usually unilateral, without
swelling or redness. It is therefore diﬀerent from the pain in the joints due to
invasion of Wind, Cold or Dampness causing Painful Obstruction Syndrome.
Pain in the foot may occur on the dorsum, the sides or the soles and the three
most common causes of it are a Kidney deficiency (which may be of Yin or
Yang), Blood deficiency and Dampness or Phlegm.
   Dampness produces pain with swelling, and in Damp-Heat there is also
redness and Heat. Phlegm causes a pain with numbness and tingling. A pain in
the ball of the foot which is aggravated by walking if the patient is overweight is
due to Damp-Phlegm.
   Pain that is due to Blood deficiency is a chronic pain with tingling.
   When the pain extends from the side of the foot towards the sole, it is usually
due to Kidney-Yang deficiency; if due to Kidney-Yin deficiency it is accompanied
by a feeling of heat of the soles, and is worse at night.
   In addition, a severe pain may be due to Cold.
   Box 39.14 summarizes the pa erns underlying foot pain.

          BOX 39.14         PAIN IN THE FEET
          • Dampness: pain with swelling
          • Damp-Heat: pain, swelling, redness and heat
          • Blood deficiency: chronic pain and tingling
          • Phlegm: pain, numbness and tingling
          • Damp-Phlegm: pain in ball of foot with overweight
          • Kidney-Yang deficiency: pain and weakness
          • Kidney-Yin deficiency: pain worse at night, feeling of heat in
      the soles
          • Cold: severe pain

     Oedema Of The Feet
   Observation, Chapters 18 and 19 ; Symptoms and Signs, Chapters 64 , 66 , 68
   Oedema of the feet is usually due to Kidney-Yang deficiency; in this case the
oedema is pi ing. If the oedema is not pi ing, it is due to Qi stagnation. Oedema
is discussed in more detail in Chapter 18 .

     Pain In The Soles
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 66
   We can diﬀerentiate three distinct areas of the sole (Fig 39.1 ): the ball of the
foot, which pertains to the Stomach channel; the area under the big toe, which
pertains to the Liver and Spleen channels, and the rest of the sole, which pertains
to the Kidney channel. Therefore a pain in the ball of the foot is often due to a
Stomach-Qi deficiency with invasion of Dampness in the limbs or to Stomach-
Heat, while a pain below thebig toe is often due to Liver-Fire or Dampness in the
Spleen.

                                            -----lf--- - Kidn e-ys

      FIG. 39.1   Areas of the sole
   A pain in the sole proper is generally due to a Kidney deficiency (Yin or
Yang), also with invasion of Dampness.

     Burning Sensation In The Soles
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 66
   A burning sensation of the soles may be due to Full-Heat of the Liver or
Stomach. If it is in the Liver, only the area under the big toe will feel hot; if it is in
the Stomach, the ball of the foot will feel hot.
   However, the most common cause of burning sensation in the soles proper is
a deficiency of Kidney-Yin, usually with Empty-Heat; in such a case, the burning
sensation is worse in the evening and at night.
      CHAPTER
        SLEEP

    CHAPTER CONTENTS
    INTRODUCTION
    INSOMNIA
    EXCESSIVE DREAMING
    SOMNOLENCE

    INTRODUCTION
   Sleep disturbances are very common in Western patients; when asking a patient
about a sleep problem, it is important to clarify whether there is diﬃculty in falling or
staying asleep, waking up early in the morning or excessive dreaming.

    WHY WE ASK
   It is essential to ask every patient about their sleep because this gives an indication
of the state of the Mind (Shen ) and Ethereal Soul (Hun ). A disturbance of the Mind or
Ethereal Soul, or both, is of course extremely common in Western patients whose lives
are generally subject to a considerable amount of stress.
   The length of sleep needed varies according to age and, in general, it gradually
decreases in one's lifetime, being highest in babies and lowest in the elderly. We
should therefore take age into account when judging whether the patient's sleep is
adequate or not.

    WHEN WE ASK
   I ask about sleep and dreaming early on in the consultation in every case. Even if a
patient does not apparently present with any problems of that kind, I always ask
about sleep and dreaming to get an idea of the state of the Mind and Ethereal Soul.

    HOW WE ASK
   It is important to be specific when asking about sleep and dreaming; it will not
suﬃce to ask ‘Do you sleep well?' I generally ask patients whether they fall asleep
easily, whether they wake up during the night and whether they dream excessively.
The last symptom is diﬃcult to define as we all dream: dreaming seems to be an
essential part of sleep, performing a function that is still the subject of debate and
disagreement. What, therefore, constitutes ‘excessive' dreaming in Chinese medicine?
I personally think this can be defined either as having many dreams, to the point of
feeling exhausted in the morning because of them, or as having unpleasant dreams
which leave one tired and slightly disturbed in the morning or even wake one up
during the night.
   If the patient dreams excessively, I then ask whether there is any recurrent dream.
Apart from a modern psychological interpretation of dreams according to the theories
of Freud, Jung and others, I always try to interpret recurrent dreams in terms of
Chinese medicine. The ‘Simple Questions' has a long list of dreams with their
significance in Chinese medicine and these are listed in Part 5 , Chapter 81 . For
example, recurrent dreams of water usually indicate a Kidney deficiency (while in
Jungian psychology water is a symbol of the unconscious).

     INSOMNIA
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 81
   In general, sleep depends on the state of Blood and Yin, especially of the Heart and
Liver, although the Blood and Yin of other organs also influences sleep. During the
night Yin energy predominates and the Mind and the Ethereal Soul should be
anchored in the Heart-Blood and Liver-Blood respectively (Fig 40.1 ).

      FIG. 40.1   Heart-Blood and Liver-Blood as anchors of the Mind and Ethereal Soul
   A sleep disturbance may be due to the Mind or the Ethereal Soul not being
anchored in the Heart-Blood(or Heart-Yin) or the Liver-Blood (or Liver-Yin)
respectively; this can happen either because there is not enough Blood or Yin to
anchor the Mind or the Ethereal Soul, or both, or because a pathogenic factor (such as
Heat) agitates them. The former is an Empty type of sleep disturbance, the la er a Full
type. In both cases, the Mind or the Ethereal Soul is said to ‘float' at night causing
insomnia (Fig 40.2 ).

                                                                       i----- - - Pa1nogenic

      FIG. 40.2   Pathology of insomnia
   In general, in Deficiency, a diﬃculty in falling asleep indicates a Blood deficiency
of the Heart, Spleen or Liver, whereas diﬃculty in staying asleep and a tendency to
wake up during the night indicate a Yin deficiency. Of course, waking up during the
night may also be due to a Full condition such as Heat, Fire, Phlegm-Fire or retention
of food.
             A diﬃculty in falling asleep generally indicates a deficiency of
       Blood or Yin; waking during the night generally indicates Yin
       deficiency with Empty-Heat.
   When diagnosing sleep disturbances it is important to distinguish, first, a Full
from an Empty condition and, secondly, a Heart from a Liver pa ern. Full conditions
are characterized by very restless sleep with a feeling of heat, agitation and excessive
dreaming; Empty conditions are characterized by not being able to fall or stay asleep
without any of the above symptoms. A Liver pa ern causing insomnia is
characterized by excessive dreaming and, compared with a Heart pa ern, a more
severe restlessness.
   However, the Heart and Liver are not the only organs that may cause insomnia:
the Stomach, Spleen, Kidneys and Gall-Bladder may all play a role in insomnia. For
example, a deficiency of Spleen-Blood often accompanies a deficiency of Heart-Blood
and contributes to causing insomnia (the famous formula Gui Pi Tang Tonifying the
Spleen Decoction treats insomnia from these pa erns). Kidney-Yin, like Liver-Yin, also
needs to anchor the Mind and the Ethereal Soul at night; therefore a deficiency of
Kidney-Yin, with or without Empty-Heat, is also a frequent cause of insomnia.
   A deficiency of the Gall-Bladder may cause someone to wake up early in the
morning without being able to fall asleep again.
   A less common cause of insomnia is residual Heat in the diaphragm, which may
occur after an invasion of Wind-Heat; this is obviously an acute type of insomnia with
recent onset.
   For a detailed description of the pa erns causing insomnia see Part 5 , Chapter 81 .
Figure 40.3 illustrates the aetiology and pathology of insomnia diﬀerentiated into the
main Empty and Full pa erns.

         • Retention of food: restless sleep with abdominal fullness

    EXCESSIVE DREAMING
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 81
   Excessive dreaming is another common sleep disturbance, which is usually due to
a pathogenic factor agitating the Ethereal Soul; this may be either a pathogenic factor
such as Fire or Phlegm-Fire, or such a one as Empty-Heat deriving from Yin
deficiency.
   ‘Excessive dreaming' is diﬃcult to define because dreaming is a normal,
physiological aspect of sleep. From the perspective of Chinese medicine it can be
defined as a level of dreaming, whether pleasant or unpleasant, that makes the sleeper
restless or wakes the patient up; it also includes nightmares, especially when they are
recurrent. Other doctors define ‘excessive dreaming' as waking up with an unpleasant
feeling from dreaming; by implication, from a Chinese perspective, ‘normal' dreaming
is not remembered in the morning.
   ‘Excessive dreaming' was called Ye You , which means ‘wandering at night', or
Meng You , which means ‘wandering in one's dream', or Meng Xing, which means
‘moving in one's dream': all these terms are a clear reference to the wandering of the
Ethereal Soul at night when we dream too much.
   With the exception of Heart and Gall-Bladder deficiency, excessive dreaming is
usually caused by a Full condition, generally of the Liver or Heart, such as Liver-Fire,
Heart-Fire or Phlegm-Fire in the Heart. Full conditions of the Stomach also frequently
cause excessive dreaming, especially Phlegm-Fire in the Stomach and retention of
food.
   The main pa erns causing excessive dreaming are summarized in Box 40.2 .

           BOX 40.2        EXCESSIVE DREAMING

           • Heart and Gall-Bladder deficiency: excessive dreaming, waking
        up easily from dreaming, absentmindedness, emotionally unstable,
        anxiety and palpitations
        SOMNOLENCE
       Interrogation, Chapter 44 ; Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 81 .
       Somnolence means dozing oﬀ frequently in the daytime or early evening. Some
Chinese books also add that the patient wakes up as he or she breathes out and then
dozes oﬀ again. ‘Somnolence' also includes some people's physiological need of
sleeping a longer time than normal, which, in adults, is approximately 7-8 hours.
       Somnolence may be due to Deficiency, usually of Qi or Yang, or both, or to Excess,
such as Dampness or Phlegm. The most common situation is a combination of
Deficiency (of the Spleen or Kidneys, or both) and a Full condition consisting of
Dampness or Phlegm.
       Of course, when a patient complains of somnolence, one should first of all enquire
about the patient's working hours: if the person works very long hours (a very
common occurrence in Western industrializedsocieties) then somnolence is not a
pathological symptom.
       For a detailed description of the pa erns causing somnolence, see Part 5 , Chapter
81 .
       Box 40.3 summarizes the pa erns underlying somnolence.

         dizziness, tinnitus, Pale-Swollen tongue, Deep-Weak pulse
             • Dampness: somnolence after eating, feeling of heaviness, sticky
         coating, Slippery pulse
             • Phlegm: somnolence after eating and in the morning, muzziness

    INTRODUCTION
   Excessive sweating is always considered a symptom requiring the doctor's
a ention in Chinese medicine. In order to define ‘excessive sweating' we should
bear in mind that under certain circumstances sweating is a normal
physiological process. For example, it is normal to sweat during exercise, after
eating spicy foods, in very hot weather and when under emotional strain.

    WHY WE ASK
   Daytime spontaneous sweating is not a crucial area of questioning for various
reasons. First of all, it is a symptom that only Chinese patients are particularly
aware of and which they therefore often report spontaneously. Western patients
report this symptom quite rarely. In terms of clinical significance as part of a
pa ern, daytime spontaneous sweating is seldom a crucial manifestation that
clinches a diagnosis.
   An exception to this occurs when we see a patient during an acute invasion of
Wind, in which case we should always ask whether there is sweating or not. The
presence of sweating indicates that the pathogenic factor is either Wind-Heat or
Wind-Cold but with the prevalence of Wind (Wind A ack Pa ern of the Greater-
Yang Pa ern) and that the patient's Upright Qi is relatively weak. Conversely,
absence of sweating during an invasion of external Wind generally indicates that
Cold predominates over Wind and that the patient's Upright Qi is strong.
   Night sweating is quite diﬀerent in so far as Western patients are more aware
of this symptom; in particular, in menopausal women this is a major symptom
that is definitely reported by the patient. Night sweating is clinically significant
to clinch the diagnosis of Yin deficiency (although it should be remembered that
other pa erns may cause night sweating, e.g. Damp-Heat, Stomach-Heat, etc.).

     WHEN WE ASK
   I ask about daytime sweating mostly to confirm a diagnosis of Lung-Qi
deficiency and about night sweating to confirm a diagnosis of Yin deficiency. If
night-time sweating appears without any manifestation of Yin deficiency, then
we need to think again and check whether this symptom is being caused by
Damp-Heat or other less common pa erns.

     HOW WE ASK
   When asking about daytime sweating, I generally ask, ‘Do you tend to sweat
abnormally even in the absence of exercise?' In the case of night-time sweating,
the question is easier and I simply ask, ‘Do you tend to sweat at night
sometimes?' We should, however, exclude night sweating that is simply caused
by too heavy a blanket and too hot a bedroom.

     CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF SWEATING
   Evaluation of symptoms of sweating must be made by considering if it is part
of an exterior or interior pa ern.

     Exterior Patterns
   In exterior pa erns, spontaneous sweating indicates either invasion of Wind-
Cold with the prevalence of Wind, which is due to a disharmony of Nutritive
and Defensive Qi, or invasion of Wind-Heat. In invasion of Wind-Cold with the
prevalence of Wind, the deficient Nutritive Qi fails to hold fluids in the space
between skin and muscles, the pores are open and the patient sweats slightly. It
is important to note that this is not a profuse, spontaneous sweating and the
patient may not be aware of it unless we ask. In exterior pa erns, slight sweating
may also occur during invasions of Wind-Heat, Wind-Dampness or Summer-
Heat.
   In the course of acute febrile diseases, when the pathogenic factor penetrates
into the Interior there is often profuse sweating, such as at the Bright-Yang stage
of the Six Stages or the Qi level of the Four Levels.

     Interior Patterns
   In interior pa erns, spontaneous sweating is due to Qi or Yang deficiency, or
to Full-Heat if it occurs in daytime and to Yin deficiency or Damp-Heat if it
occurs at night. In Qi or Yang deficiency it is usually a deficiency of Lungs or
Heart; in Full-Heat it is usually Heat (or Damp-Heat) in the Heart, Liver, Lungs
or Stomach.

          Night sweating is not always due to Yin deficiency.
   Box 41.1 summarizes the pa erns causing sweating in interior conditions.

          BOX 41.1         SWEATING IN INTERIOR
      CONDITIONS
        Daytime sweating
          • Qi deficiency (of Lungs/Heart)
          • Yang deficiency (of Lungs, Heart or Kidneys)
          • Collapse of Yang or Yin
          • Liver-Fire
          • Heart-Fire
          • Lung-Heat
          • Stomach-Heat
          • Damp-Heat in the Stomach and Spleen
          • Phlegm-Heat in the Lungs
          • Phlegm-Heat in the Heart
          • Phlegm-Heat in the Stomach
          Night sweating
          • Yin deficiency (of any organ)
          • Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat
          • Damp-Heat in Stomach and Spleen
          • Deficiency of Qi and Blood of the Heart

     PATHOLOGY OF SWEATING
   Daytime sweating involves loss of fluids from the space between skin and
muscles where the Defensive Qi circulates; sweating at night (called Dao Han in
Chinese, which literally means ‘thief sweating') involves loss of fluids from the
bone level and is often called ‘steaming from the bones'. Therefore the fluids lost
during night sweating are more precious than those lost during daytime
sweating: the fluids lost during daytime sweating are simply Body Fluids (Jin-Ye
), whereas those lost during night sweating are nutritive Yin Essences. However,
both daytime and night-time sweating start a pathological vicious circle because
they can derive from a deficiency but also aggravate that deficiency. In fact,
daytime sweating injures Qi (the pores are called ‘Qi holes') while night
sweating injures Yin.
   Old Chinese books say that night-time sweat tastes sweet (because it is a Yin
Essence), while sweat lost in daytime tastes salty.
   Besides daytime and night-time sweating, there are two other types of
sweating: sweating from collapse (Jue Han ); and shiver sweating (Zhan Han ).
   Sweating from collapse occurs during collapse of Yang or collapse of Yin: the
sweat from collapse of Yin is oily, whereas that from collapse of Yang pours out
in watery and dilute drops.
   Shiver sweating is seen usually in acute, febrile diseases and is characterized
by a bout of shivering followed by sweating. If the fever abates after sweating,
and the pulse is quiet and the body feels cold to the touch, this means that the
pathogenic factor has been expelled and the Upright Qi has prevailed; but if after
sweating there is restlessness and the pulse is Rapid it indicates that the
pathogenic factor has prevailed and the Upright Qi has been severely weakened.

    CLASSIFICATION OF SWEATING
   Observation, Chapter 20 ; Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 76 .
   One must distinguish sweating according to the area of body, time of day,
conditions and quality of sweat.

    Area Of Body
   The significance of body areas may be summarized as:

         • only on head: Heat or Damp-Heat in the Stomach, Heat in
      the Upper Burner, deficient Yang floating upwards, retention of
      food
         • only on hands and feet: deficiency of Qi or Yin of the Lungs
      or Heart and Kidneys; it could also be due to Heat in the Lungs or
      Heart and Kidneys
         • oily sweat on forehead: collapse of Yin
         • only on nose: Damp-Heat in the Lungs or Stomach, or both
         • only on arms and legs: Stomach and Spleen deficiency
         • only on hands: deficiency of Qi or Yin of the Lungs or Heart,
      or Heat in the Lungs or Heart
         • whole body: Lung-Qi deficiency
         • on palms, soles and chest: Yin deficiency (called five-palm
      sweat).
    Time Of Day
   The significance of time of day may be summarized as:

            • in daytime: Yang deficiency
            • at night-time: Yin deficiency (in some cases it can also be
      from Damp-Heat).

    Condition Of Illness
   The conditions of illness are:

            • profuse cold sweat during a severe illness: collapse of Yang
            • oily sweat on forehead, like pearls, not flowing: collapse of
      Yang, danger of imminent death.

    Quality Of Sweat
   The diﬀerent qualities of sweat are:

            • oily: severe Yang deficiency
            • yellow: Damp-Heat.

    ABSENCE OF SWEATING
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 76
   Absence of sweating is also a symptom in Chinese medicine. In exterior
invasions of Wind, it is always important to ask about sweating: the absence of
sweating indicates invasion of Wind-Cold with the prevalence of Cold and this
corresponds to the Greater-Yang stage within the Six Stages identification of
pa erns. The Greater-Yang stage is always caused by the invasion of Wind-Cold,
of which there are two types: one with the prevalence of Cold (in which there is
no sweating), the other with the prevalence of Wind (in which there is sweating).
   In other exterior conditions, absence of sweating usually indicates Cold or
Cold-Dampness in the superficial layers of the body (the space between skin and
muscles).
   In interior conditions, absence of sweating indicates a ‘tight' and excessively
closed state of the space between the skin and muscles (Cou Li ). This renders the
person more prone to fever when invaded by a pathogenic factor and it also
indicates that the person is more prone to Full than Empty conditions.
   For a more detailed description of various types of sweating, see Part 5 ,
Chapter 76 .

    CHAPTER CONTENTS

            Tinnitus
            Deafness

            Dry eyes
            Blurred vision

    EARS
   The ears are the orifices of the Kidneys and for this reason tinnitus and deafness
are often due to a Kidney deficiency. However, the ears are also influenced by
many other organs including the Liver, Heart, Lungs and Gall-Bladder. In addition,
although the Spleen is not directly related to the ears, Dampness or Phlegm
(deriving from Spleen-Qi deficiency) may also aﬀect the ears.

    WHY WE ASK
   I generally ask about any ear symptoms under three main circumstances: when
there is a Kidney deficiency, Liver-Yang rising or Phlegm. In the last of these,
Phlegm obstructs the orifices and may cause tinnitus or deafness.

    WHEN WE ASK
   I usually ask about any ear symptoms towards the end of the consultation,
primarily to confirm a pa ern of Kidney deficiency, Liver-Yang rising or Phlegm.

     HOW WE ASK
   When asking about tinnitus it is important to express this symptom in terms
patients can understand. I generally ask them whether they experience any ‘ringing
in the ears'. It is important to let the patient understand that even an occasional
ringing in the ears has clinical significance.
   In general terms, the ears may be aﬀected by a pathology of Deficiency (usually
of the Kidneys but also of Lung and Heart) causing tinnitus, hardness of hearing or
deafness, or by one of Fullness, usually due to Heat or Phlegm.
   The main deficiency pa erns aﬀecting the ear are:

          • Kidney deficiency (or Yin or Yang) causing tinnitus or deafness,
      or both
          • Lung-Qi deficiency causing tinnitus
          • Heart-Blood deficiency causing tinnitus.
   The main Full pa erns aﬀecting the ears are:

          • Liver-Yang rising causing tinnitus and deafness
          • Liver-Fire causing tinnitus and deafness
          • Phlegm in the head causing tinnitus
          • Damp-Heat in the Gall-Bladder causing earache.

     Tinnitus
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 57
   Tinnitus is caused either by a failure of Qi to rise to the ears (Empty type) or by
an excess of Qi in the ears (Full type). In order to diﬀerentiate between the Empty
types and the Full types, we need to consider the onset, the pitch, the duration and
the reaction to pressure of the tinnitus.
   A sudden onset suggests a Full condition, which may be internal such as Liver-
Fire or Liver-Wind, or external such as Heat in the Lesser Yang. A gradual onset
suggests an Empty condition, which may be due to a deficiency of the Kidneys,
Lung or Heart.
   A loud, high-pitched, ringing noise like a whistle indicates Liver-Yang rising,
Liver-Fire or Liver-Wind, whereas a low-pitched noise like rushing water indicates
a Kidney deficiency.
   Tinnitus of short duration is usually due to an external invasion of Wind-Heat
aﬀecting the Lesser Yang channels. Chronic tinnitus of long duration is due to
either a Kidney deficiency or a Liver pathology (Liver-Yang rising, Liver-Fire, or
Liver-Wind).
   If the tinnitus is aggravated by pressing one's hands on the ears, this suggests a
Full condition; if it is alleviated it suggests an Empty condition.
   Case history 42.1 illustrates a pa ern of tinnitus caused by Yin deficiency.

                  Case History 42.1
          A 56-year-old woman had been suﬀering from tinnitus for 3
      years. The onset had been slow and gradual and the ear noise was
      low in pitch. She also suﬀered from poor memory, lack of
      concentration, blurred vision, dizziness and hot flushes (flashes). On
      asking her, it transpired that she also experience a dry mouth,
      anxiety and palpitations. Her urine was dark. She also said that she
      startled easily.
          She also experienced occasionally a dull ache in the chest, with
      the pain sensation extending up to the neck like a ‘steel band'.
          Her periods had stopped 2 years previously. Her tongue was
      Red, with a redder tip, entirely without coating and dry. Her pulse
      was Weak on both Rear positions and very slightly Wiry but Fine on
      the left.
          Diagnosis:
          This patient presents with very clear manifestations of Kidney-
      Yin deficiency (dark urine, tinnitus, dizziness, blurred vision, hot
      flushes) and Heart-Yin deficiency (poor memory and concentration,
      palpitations, anxiety and propensity to be startled). The condition of
      Yin deficiency is shown very clearly by the absence of coating, and
      the redness of the tongue (combined with the lack of coating) clearly
      indicates Empty-Heat. I interpreted the dull ache in the chest
      extending to the neck as a symptom of rebellious Qi of the
      Penetrating Vessel, a common complicating factor in menopausal
      problems. The Wiry quality of the pulse on the left supports this
      diagnosis.
   Box 42.1 summarizes the pa erns underlying tinnitus.

          BOX 42.1         TINNITUS
          • Lesser-Yang Heat pa ern: tinnitus of sudden onset and
      alternation of chills and fever
          • Liver-Fire or Liver-Yang rising: tinnitus of sudden onset with
      headache
          • Liver-Fire, Liver-Wind or Liver-Yang rising: high-pitched
      tinnitus
          • Kidney deficiency: low-pitched tinnitus
          • Liver-Fire, Liver-Yang rising or Liver-Wind: chronic, severe
      tinnitus
          • Kidney deficiency: chronic, mild, intermi ent tinnitus
         • Deficiency of Heart- and Lung-Qi: chronic, mild, intermi ent
      tinnitus with palpitations and weak voice

    Deafness
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 57
   The diagnostic criteria of deafness or hardness of hearing are similar to those of
tinnitus: an acute onset points to Fullness, whereas a gradual onset points to
Deficiency. The main Excess causes of deafness or hardness of hearing are Liver-
Fire, Liver-Yang rising and Phlegm-Fire aﬀecting the Liver channel.
   The main Empty cause of deafness or hardness of hearing is a Kidney
deficiency (the most common cause in the elderly). However, the Kidneys are not
the only organ that influences the ears; hardness of hearing may also be caused by
Heart-Blood, Heart-Yin, Lung- or Heart-Qi deficiency, or deficiency of the
Gathering Qi (Zong-Qi ) or Yang-Qi. In all these cases, hardness of hearing is due to
Qi or Blood not flowing upwards to the ears.
   Box 42.2 summarizes the pa erns underlying deafness.

          BOX 42.2        DEAFNESS
         • Kidney deficiency: dizziness, tinnitus, backache
         • Liver-Yang rising: dizziness, tinnitus, headache
         • Liver-Fire: tinnitus, thirst, bi er taste
         • Phlegm-Fire in the Liver channel: dizziness, tinnitus, sputum in
      throat, headache
         • Heart- and Kidney-Yin deficiency: dizziness, palpitations,
      insomnia
         • Lung- and Heart-Qi deficiency: palpitation, shortness of breath,
      weak voice
         • Heart-Blood deficiency: palpitations, poor memory, insomnia

    Earache
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 57
   With the exception of Qi and Blood stagnation, earache is usually due to Heat;
this can be an invasion of Wind-Heat aﬀecting the Lesser-Yang channels (which is
very common in children, and accompanied by aversion to cold and fever), Damp-
Heat in the Liver and Gall-Bladder channel or Liver-Fire. A yellow discharge from
the ear may accompany an invasion of Wind-Heat or Damp-Heat in the Liver and
Gall-Bladder. Earache from Liver-Fire is accompanied by headache, a red face and
a bi er taste in the mouth. The chronic earache from Qi and Blood stagnation is not
common and is usually seen only in the elderly.
   Box 42.3 summarizes the pa erns underlying earache.

          BOX 42.3        EARACHE
         • Wind-Heat in Lesser Yang channels: aversion to cold, fever,
      yellow discharge
         • Damp-Heat in Gall-Bladder: ear discharge
         • Liver-Fire: headache, red face, bi er taste in mouth
         • Qi and Blood stagnation: chronic earache (in the elderly)

    Itchy Ears
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 57
   In acute cases, itchiness in the ears is due to invasion of Wind-Heat in the
Lesser-Yang channels. In chronic cases, it is due either to Blood deficiency leading
to internal Wind or to Kidney-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat.
   Box 42.4 summarizes the pa erns underlying itchy ears.

          BOX 42.4       ITCHY EARS
         • Wind-Heat in the Lesser-Yang channels: acute
         • Blood deficiency leading to Wind: chronic
         • Kidney-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat: chronic

    EYES
   The eyes are the orifice of the Liver, but this does not mean that all eye
problems are related to the Liver. In fact, other organs aﬀect the eyes and notable
among these are the Heart, Kidneys and Gall-Bladder.
   The Heart influences the eyes as both its Main and Connecting channels go to
the eyeballs (see Fig 6.1 on p. 77 ). For this reason, many eye problems are due to
Heart-Heat deriving from emotional problems.
   The Kidneys nourish and moisten the eyes in a similar way to the Liver, and eye
problems in the elderly are very frequently due to a Kidney deficiency.
   The Gall-Bladder channel also goes through the eyes and it may cause eye
problems, usually in conjunction with Liver-Fire or Liver-Yang rising.

    WHY WE ASK
   The questions regarding the eyes are somewhat more important than those
regarding the ears, first because eye problems are more common and secondly
because some eye symptoms often clinch a diagnosis. For example, the symptom of
dry eyes often clinches the diagnosis of Liver-Yin deficiency (although it may also
be caused by Kidney-Yin deficiency).

    WHEN WE ASK
   I ask about eye symptoms early during the interrogation in conjunction with
questions aimed at identifying a particular pa ern. For example, if a patient
displays symptoms of Liver-Blood deficiency, I would ask about blurred vision and
floaters immediately; I would then ask about dry eyes to find out whether the
Liver-Blood deficiency has progressed to a deeper level of Liver-Yin deficiency.
        Questions regarding blurred vision, floaters, dry eyes and red/painful/itchy
eyes are important and I ask them in nearly every case.

            HOW WE ASK
        ‘Blurred vision' is not an expression most patients are familiar with. I generally
ask them whether their vision is sometimes ‘not clear or somewhat obfuscated',
stressing that the condition at issue is quite apart from their being short sighted or
not. ‘Floaters' is another expression most patients are not familiar with and I
generally ask whether they ever see ‘black or white spots floating in the field of
vision'.

      FIG. 42.1    Differentiation of eye pain

     Radiation of pain
   Eye pain should also be diﬀerentiated according to its radiation. If the pain
radiates to the occiput, the Greater-Yang channels are aﬀected; if it radiates to the
sides of the head and the outer corners of the eyes, the Lesser-Yang channels are
aﬀected; if it radiates to the nose and teeth, the Bright-Yang channels are aﬀected; if
it radiates to the top of the head, the Liver channel is aﬀected.

     Eye pain of internal or external origin
   Eye pain can first be diﬀerentiated into internal and external types (Fig 42.1 );
secondly internal eye pain can be diﬀerentiated into Full and Empty as indicated in
Table 42.1 .
   Eye pain of external origin is mostly due to invasion of Wind-Heat and is
characterized by a sudden onset, sticky eyelids and streaming eyes, with an
aversion to cold and a fever.
   Eye pain from a Full condition is often accompanied by swelling and redness.
   Box 42.5 summarizes the pa erns underlying eye pain.

           • Liver-Yang rising: headache, eye distension
           • Heart-Fire: red eyes, palpitations, anxiety
           • Liver-Wind: vertigo
           • Damp-Heat: sticky eyelids, sticky yellow tongue coating
           • Phlegm-Heat: sticky eyelids, feeling of oppression of the chest,
      dizziness

          • Kidney deficiency: dizziness, tinnitus
          • Deficiency of Qi and Yin: slightly hot and painful eyes, mild
      pain, desire to shut eyes, red eyes, tiredness, dry eyes

     Itchy Eyes
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 61
   Excluding invasions of external Wind, itchy eyes are usually caused either by
Liver-Fire or by a deficiency of Liver-Blood giving rise to Liver-Wind. Itchy eyes in
allergic rhinitis are a separate pathology which is not Liver-related, but is related to
external Wind as the reaction caused by the invasion of allergens mimics that of
invasion of external Wind.
   Box 42.6 summarizes the pa erns underlying itchy eyes.

          BOX 42.6        ITCHY EYES
          • Liver-Fire: intensely itchy and red eyes
          • Liver-Blood deficiency leading to Wind: intense itchiness and
      tic of the face
          • External Wind: acute

     Feeling Of Distension Of The Eyes
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 61
   A feeling of distension of the eyes is often associated with emotional problems
aﬀecting the Liver, causing Liver-Qi stagnation and Liver-Fire.

     Streaming Eyes
   Observation, Chapter 6 ; Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 61
   Streaming eyes may be due to Heat of the Full or Empty type. In particular, it
may be due to Full-or Empty-Heat of the Lung or Stomach.
   Other causes of streaming eyes include external Wind-Heat, Liver-Fire and
Liver-Blood deficiency associated with Liver-Heat. In some cases, streaming eyes
may be due to Liver-Blood deficiency and general Qi deficiency or to Kidney-Yang
deficiency: these two types of streaming eyes are called ‘cold streaming'.
   Box 42.7 summarizes the pa erns underlying streaming eyes.

          BOX 42.7        STREAMING EYES
          • Lung-Heat: cough
          • Lung Empty-Heat: dry cough

          • Stomach Empty-Heat: epigastric pain, thirst with desire to sip
          • External Wind-Heat: aversion to cold, fever
          • Liver-Fire: red eyes, bi er taste
          • Liver-Blood deficiency with some Heat: blurred vision, red
       eyes
          • Liver-Blood deficiency: blurred vision
          • Kidney-Yang deficiency: backache, abundant clear urine
          • General Qi deficiency: tiredness, loose stools, weak voice

       Dry Eyes
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 61
   The most common causes of dry eyes are severe Liver-Blood deficiency or
Liver-Yin deficiency. In the elderly, dry eyes are often due to Liver- and Kidney-
Yin deficiency; in some cases Lung-Yin deficiency is also involved. Dry eyes with
acute onset may be due to invasion of Wind-Heat, in which case they would also be
red.
   Box 42.8 summarizes the pa erns underlying dry eyes.

          BOX 42.8        DRY EYES
          • Liver-Yin deficiency: blurred vision
          • Liver- and Kidney-Yin deficiency: dizziness, tinnitus
          • Lung-Yin deficiency: dry cough
          • External Wind-Heat: acute onset, red eyes, aversion to cold,
       fever

       Blurred Vision
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 61
   ‘Blurred vision', called Mu Xuan in Chinese, indicates not only blurring of
vision and floaters but also includes a slight dizziness.
   Although blurred vision is a relatively common complaint, when asked
whether they suﬀer from it most patients will either answer negatively or not know
what we mean. Thus, this question should be asked in a diﬀerent way, such as ‘Do
you have any problems with your vision?' or ‘Is your vision sometimes unclear?'
   First of all, it should be remembered that the eyes are under the control not only
of the Liver but also of the Gall-Bladder and Kidneys; especially in the elderly, a
Kidney deficiency is often at the root of eye problems and blurred vision.
   Among the Deficiency types, the most common causes of blurred vision are
Liver-Blood or Liver-Yin deficiency. If blurred vision is associated with dryness of
the eyes, this suggests either Liver-Yin deficiency or Liver- and Kidney-Yin
deficiency, which is common in the elderly.
   Blurred vision may also be due to Excess pa erns such as Gall-Bladder Heat,
Liver-Yang rising (a common feature in migraine), Liver-Fire and Phlegm. Phlegm,
in particular, is not often recognized as a possible cause of blurred vision; however,
it may cause a blurring of vision with muzziness and dizziness because it obstructs
the clear orifices of the head, including the eyes (for the same reason, Phlegm may
cause tinnitus).
   Box 42.9 summarizes the pa erns underlying blurred vision.

          BOX 42.9        BLURRED VISION
          • Liver-Blood deficiency: floaters, dizziness

     INTRODUCTION
   Questions about feeling of cold or heat and fever are generally asked towards
the end of the interrogation to establish the Hot or Cold nature of a pa ern.

     WHY WE ASK
   We should always ask all our patients about feelings of cold or heat; the
clinical significance, however, varies in internal and external conditions. In
internal conditions (which constitute the overwhelming majority of most
practices) the distinction between feelings of cold and feelings of heat simply
tells us about the Cold or Hot nature of the prevailing pa ern.
   In external conditions (e.g. when a patient presents with an acute cold or
influenza) questions about feelings of cold or heat are needed primarily to
establish, first of all, whether it is indeed an external condition and whether the
pathogenic factor is on the Exterior or Interior.
   The patient's cold or hot feeling should never be discounted, even when it
contradicts the tongue or pulse, or both. For example, a patient may have a
clearly Red tongue but always feel cold: although the sign of a Red tongue is
very important, we should not discount the cold feeling and should investigate
further to find the cause of this discrepancy.

     WHEN WE ASK
   As mentioned above, questions about feelings of cold and heat should always
be asked routinely in all patients.
   In internal conditions , questions about a patient's feeling cold or hot are
often asked towards the end of the consultation to confirm the existence of a
Cold or Hot pa ern. Often questions about feelings of cold or heat also help us
to detect the constitutional tendency of a patient to Cold or Hot conditions. For
example, patients may not have significant symptoms of Yang deficiency and
Cold but, on asking, may say that they always feel cold, need to wear more
clothes than other people, etc.; this symptom should never be discounted
because it indicates an underlying tendency to Yang deficiency and Cold
pa erns.
   In external conditions , questions about feelings of cold and heat are crucial
and should always be asked in detail to establish whether the pathogenic factor
has gone into the Interior or whether it is still on the Exterior. If we see a patient
every day in the course of an acute, exterior condition, as we should, we should
carefully ask about feelings of cold and heat every day to establish the exterior or
interior nature of the pa ern.

     HOW WE ASK
   In China, the questions about feeling of cold and feeling of heat coincide
almost exactly with the terminology of Chinese medicine, which makes it very
easy for Chinese doctors. With Western patients, it is a li le more diﬃcult and
we need to make sure that we ask patients about feelings of cold and heat in a
way that they can readily understand.
   In interior conditions, for feelings of cold we should simply ask, ‘Do you feel
cold in general?', ‘Do you have a tendency to feel cold?' or ‘Do you notice that
you feel colder than other people?'. For feelings of heat we should ask questions
such as, ‘Would you say you feel hot in general?', ‘Do you sometimes feel
unusually hot?' or ‘Do you want to open the window when everyone else wants
it closed?' If patients answer aﬃrmatively to one of the above questions about
feelings of heat, then we should go on to ask more specifically about when they
tend to feel hot in order to establish whether it is Full- or Empty-Heat. We
therefore ask questions such as ‘Do you tend to feel ho er in the afternoon or
evening?'

     Terminology
   Before discussing the various causes of feeling cold, or feeling of hot and
feverish, I would like to clarify somepoints regarding terminology, particularly
with regard to fever.
   The cause of disease in feeling of cold, feeling of heat or fever may be external
(e.g. external Wind) or internal ; thus, the cause of disease simply refers to the
origin of the pathogenic factor.
   The pa ern (or syndrome ) refers to the location of the pathogenic factor, which
may be on the Interior or Exterior : this is decided not according to the origin of
the pathogenic factor but on the basis of the clinical manifestations. In other
words, an external cause of disease (e.g. external Wind) may cause both an
exterior pa ern and an interior pa ern (Fig 43.1 ).
                                                                /   Exterior pattern

                                                                    Interior pattern

                                 Intema,I cause of d is.:ease       Interior pattern
       FIG. 43.1 Relationship between external and internal causes of disease with exterior and
   interior patterns
   An external cause of disease is, for example, external Wind: this causes
initially an exterior pa ern; if the pathogenic factor is not expelled, however, it
goes on to cause an interior pa ern. An internal cause of disease (such as Liver-
Fire) causes an interior pa ern by definition.
   With regard to fever, we should not confuse a fever from an external cause
with an exterior fever: an external cause may cause an exterior fever initially and
later, if the pathogenic factor is not expelled, it will cause an interior fever.

     FEELING OF COLD
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 82
   There are four diﬀerent degrees of ‘cold feeling' which apply both to interior
and exterior conditions. In ascending order of severity with their clinical
significance these are:

         • ‘aversion to wind' (Wu Feng , literally ‘loathing or disliking
      wind')
         • ‘fear of cold' (Wei Han )
         • ‘aversion to cold' (Wu Han , literally ‘loathing or disliking
      cold')
         • ‘shivers' (Han Zhan ).
   Aversion to wind means that the patient has goose pimples, dislikes going
out in the wind and wants to stay indoors.
   Fear of cold means that the patient feels quite cold, wants to stay indoors and
close to a source of heat, and wants to cover up.
   Aversion to cold means that the patient feels very cold, wants to stay indoors
and likes to wrap up in bed with many blankets.
   Shivers means that the patient feels extremely cold, shivers and wants to be
covered up in bed under a heap of blankets.
   The symptoms of feeling cold should be clearly diﬀerentiated between
interior and exterior pa erns.

    Feeling Of Cold In Interior Conditions
   In internal diseases, questions about feeling cold serve to establish the Cold
nature of the presenting pa erns. Cold may be Full or Empty. Whether it is Full
or Empty, it always manifests with a feeling of cold.
   If a person feels easily cold and experiences cold limbs, this clearly indicates
either Full-Cold or Empty- Cold deriving from Yang deficiency. In patients with
chronic diseases, Empty-Cold is more common than Full-Cold.
   Full-Cold is characterized by an intense feeling of cold and shivers; the body
also feels cold to the touch. Various parts of the body may feel particularly cold
depending on the location of the Cold: if it is in the Stomach the limbs and
epigastrium will feel cold, if in the Intestines the legs and lower abdomen are
cold, if in the Uterus the lower abdomen feels cold. Full-Cold has usually a
sudden onset and may last only a few months at the most because Cold will
inevitably injure Yang and lead to Yang deficiency and therefore Empty-Cold.
   Box 43.1 summarizes the clinical manifestations of Full-Cold.

     Yang deficiency of any organ may cause a cold feeling or cold limbs, or both.
It could be due especiallyto a deficiency of Yang of the Heart, Lungs, Spleen,
Kidneys and Stomach. The cold feeling is both subjective and objective, that is,
the patient feels easily and frequently cold and the limbs or other parts of the
body will feel cold to the touch.
     A deficiency of Yang of the Lungs or Heart, or both, will manifest especially
with cold hands (Fig 43.2 ), a deficiency of Spleen-Yang with cold limbs and
abdomen (Fig 43.3 ) and that of Kidney-Yang especially with cold legs, knees,
feet and back (Fig 43.4 ). A deficiency of Stomach-Yang will manifest with cold
epigastrium and cold limbs in a similar way to Spleen-Yang deficiency (Fig 43.3
).

      • Body feels mildly cold to touch
      • No pain
            • Weak pulse
            • Slow, gradual onset
   There are however, other causes of cold limbs (as opposed to a general cold
feeling). One is Qi stagnation: when Qi stagnates it may fail to reach the hands
and feet and these become cold (Fig 43.5 ). This is called the ‘Four Rebellious
Syndrome', in which the ‘Four Rebellious' indicate cold hands and feet; the
famous formula Si Ni San Four Rebellious Powder is used for this pa ern. An
important diﬀerence between cold in the limbs due to Yang deficiency and that
due to Qi stagnation is that in the former case the whole limb will be cold
whereas in the la er case only the hands and feet, and especially the fingers, are
cold.

        FIG. 43.5   Cold hands and feet from Qi stagnation
   Besides this, cold limbs may also derive in women from Blood deficiency; this
is due to the deficient Blood not reaching the extremities. In cases of Heart-Blood
deficiency only the hands and chest will be cold (Fig 43.6 ), whereas in cases of
Liver-Blood deficiency the feet will be cold (Fig 43.7 ).

   We should bear in mind that, even if patients feel cold in general, they may
have a feeling of heat in a specific part of their body, (e.g the face) and we should
therefore always remember to ask about specific parts of the body after we have
asked about the generalfeeling. A very common example of this, especially in
women, is a general cold feeling with occasional episodes of feeling hot in the
face.
          When patients feels cold in general, remember to ask then
      whether they feel hot in any particular part of the body.
   Box 43.3 summarizes the pa erns underlying a cold feeling and cold limbs in

     Feeling Of Cold In Exterior Conditions
External invasions
   In external invasions, a feeling of cold or shivers serves to establish whether
the pathogenic factor is in the Exterior or in the Interior. In fact, when the
pathogenic factor is on the Exterior, the patient feels cold, shivers and dislikes
the idea of going out (often referred to as ‘aversion to cold'). The cold feeling
may or may not be accompanied by an actual fever, but it will be associated with
heat in the skin, that is, the patient feels cold and shivers but his or her skin feels
hot to the touch.
   The areas that are usually touched to gauge this are the dorsum of the hands
and the forehead. It should be stressed that the feeling of cold and fever (or body
feeling hot to the touch) are simultaneous and not alternating: thus, if a patient
feels cold in the morning without a fever and without body feeling hot to the
touch and has a fever in the evening, this would correspond to the Lesser-Yang
syndrome and would not constitute the beginning stage of an invasion of Wind.
Figure 43.8 diﬀerentiates the manifestations of cold feeling in exterior and
interior conditions.

      FIG. 43.8   Cold feeling in exterior and interior conditions
   In exterior syndromes, the presence of a cold feeling and shivering is a
determining factor in diagnosing that the pathogenic factor is still on the Exterior
and that the pa ern is therefore an ‘Exterior' one. As soon as the cold feeling
disappears and the patient feels hot, this is a certain sign that the pathogenic
factor is in the Interior and it has transformed into Heat. One can see these signs
very clearly in small children: when the pathogenic factor is on the Exterior, the
child will tend to go to bed and cover himself or herself with lots of blankets. As
the pathogenic factor enters the Interior (usually changing into Heat), the child
throws the blankets oﬀ.
   Box 43.4 summarizes the clinical manifestations of interior and exterior
pathogenic factors.

          BOX 43.4         INTERIOR VERSUS EXTERIOR
      PATHOGENIC FACTOR
          • Pathogenic factor on the Exterior: feeling of cold, shivers,
      dislike of going out, possibly a fever, patient is hot to the touch
      (especially forehead and dorsum of the hand)
          • Pathogenic factor in the Interior: cold feeling disappears,
      patient feels only hot

     Wind-Cold versus Wind-Heat
   In exterior pa erns, both Wind-Cold and Wind-Heat cause a cold feeling and
shivering; it is a common misconception that this is not the case with Wind-Heat.
Since the cold feeling is caused by the obstruction of Defensive Qi by Wind
(whether it is Wind-Cold or Wind-Heat) in the space between skin and muscles,
the cold feeling and shivering are present also in invasions of Wind-Heat, albeit
to a lesser degree than in Wind-Cold. This will be explained in greater detail
below.

     How To Distinguish Between External And
Internal Causes Of Feeling Of Cold
   The distinction between a cold feeling from an invasion of external Wind and
a cold feeling from internal Cold (which may be Full or Empty) is fairly easy as
the accompanying symptoms are quite obvious. During an external invasion
with the pathogenic factor still on the Exterior, the patient feels cold, dislikes the
idea of going out, shivers, and may have a fever, and the dorsum of the hand
feels hot; in addition, there will be sneezing, a cough, a nasal discharge, a sore
throat, a headache, body aches and a Floating pulse.
   When the patient suﬀers from interior Cold, there are none of the above
symptoms. Another distinction between a cold feeling in exterior syndromes and
one in interior syndromes is that in the former case the cold feeling is not
alleviated by covering oneself, while in the la er case it is. In fact patients who
feel cold and shiver from an invasion of exterior Wind will want to go to bed and
cover up with blankets, but this will not alleviate the cold feeling and shivering.
If a patient suﬀers from internal Cold, this will be alleviated by covering oneself.
Table 43.1 summarizes the diﬀerentiation between external and internal Cold.

     Differentiation of pathology of a feeling of cold from external
or internal causes
      The pathogenesis of a cold feeling in exterior pa erns is diﬀerent from that in
interior pa erns. In exterior pa erns, the cold feeling is due to the fact that the
external Wind obstructs the space between skin and muscles where the
Defensive Qi circulates; as Defensive Qi warms the muscles, its obstruction by
Wind causes the patient to feel cold and shiver (even if the pathogenic factor is
Wind-Heat). Thus, Defensive Qi is not necessarily weak but only obstructed in
the space between skin and muscles.
      In interior pa erns, the cold feeling is usually due either to a Yang deficiency
and a failure of Yang Qi to warm the muscles and limbs (in case of Empty-Cold)
or to Cold obstructing the flow of Yang Qi to the muscles and limbs (in case of
Full-Cold).

  SIMULTANEOUS FEELING OF COLD AND
FEVER IN EXTERIOR CONDITIONS
      First of all, we should define ‘fever'. ‘Fever' does not indicate an actual raised
temperature (as measured by a thermometer) but an objective emanation of heat
from the patient's body felt on palpation (especially on the forehead and dorsum
of hands). This is discussed in more detail below.
      A simultaneous feeling of cold and fever indicates the invasion of an exterior
pathogenic factor and that this factor is still on the Exterior. The simultaneous
presence of a cold feeling or shivers with a fever, or both, usually indicates an
acute invasion of Wind and it denotes that the pathogenic factor is still on the
Exterior: as long as there is a feeling of cold the pathogenic factor is on the
Exterior. The clinical situations when the pathogenic factor is on the Exterior are
described in the Greater-Yang pa ern within the Six Stages from the ‘Discussion
of Cold-induced Diseases' (Shang Han Lun ) and the Defensive-Qi level within
the Four Levels described by the School of Warm Diseases (Wen Bing ) of the
Qing dynasty (see Part 6 ). As mentioned above, it is important to stress that the
feeling of cold and fever (or body feeling hot to the touch) are simultaneous and
not alternating (Fig 43.9 ).
                                )
        FIG. 43.9   Simultaneous feeling of cold and fever
   Although it is the simultaneous occurrence of cold feeling and fever that
defines an exterior pa ern due to invasion of exterior Wind, I shall discuss the
pathology of cold feeling and fever in more detail separately.
   The aetiology and pathology of Wind-Heat can be used as a blueprint to
explain the aetiology and pathology of Summer-Heat, Damp-Heat and Dry-
Heat.
   The pathogenic factors discussed are:

                                                                             -I

            • Wind-Cold
            • Summer-Heat
            • Damp-Heat
            • Dry-Heat.
                                                                                 -1
   Before discussing the above pathogenic factors, we should first discuss the
pathology and clinical manifestation of ‘feeling of cold' and ‘fever'.

     Cold feeling (‘aversion to cold') in exterior patterns
   In exterior pa erns, as explained above, the cold feeling is due to the fact that
the external Wind obstructs the space between the skin and muscles (called Cou
Li ) where the Defensive Qi circulates; and Defensive Qi is not necessarily weak
but only obstructed . Also, since the cold feeling is caused by the obstruction of
Defensive Qi by Wind (whether it is Wind-Cold or Wind-Heat) in the space
between the skin and muscles, the cold feeling and shivering are present also in
invasions of Wind-Heat, albeit to a lesser degree than in Wind-Cold.
   As mentioned above, there are four diﬀerent degrees of ‘cold feeling' in
Exterior conditions: ‘aversion to wind', ‘fear of cold', ‘aversion to cold' and
‘shivers'. The clinical significance of these four degrees of feeling of cold in the
context of exterior invasions is listed in Box 43.5 .

             BOX 43.5             DEGREES OF FEELING COLD
            • Aversion to wind : the patient has goose pimples, dislikes
        going out in the wind and wants to stay indoors
            • Fear of cold : the patient feels quite cold, wants to be indoors
        near sources of heat and wants to cover up
          • Aversion to cold : the patient feels very cold and wants to
      stay indoors but covering up or staying in bed under blankets does
      not relieve the cold feeling
          • Shivers : the patient feels extremely cold and shivers but
      covering up or staying in bed under blankets does not relieve the
      cold feeling
   Thus, generally speaking, there are three aspects to the ‘cold feeling' in
invasions of exterior Wind: the patient feels cold, has ‘waves' of shivers and is
reluctant to go out and wants to stay indoors near sources of heat. Except in mild
cases, the cold feeling is not relieved by covering oneself.
   In conclusion, a feeling of cold in exterior invasions is due to the obstruction
of Defensive Qi in the space between skin and muscles and it indicates that the
pathogenic factor is on the Exterior; as soon as the feeling of cold goes, the
pathogenic factor is in the Interior.

     Fever in exterior patterns
   As for ‘fever' it is important to understand that the Chinese term Fa Shao does
not necessarily indicate what we mean by fever. ‘Fever' is a sign in modern
Western medicine, not in old Chinese medicine. In old China, there were
obviously no thermometers and the symptom Fa Shao described in the old texts
does not necessarily mean that the patient has an actual fever. It literally means
‘emi ing burning heat' and it indicates that the patient's body feels hot, in severe
cases almost burning to the touch; the areas touched are usually the forehead
and especially the dorsum of the hands (as opposed to the palms, which tend to
reflect more Empty-Heat).
   In fact, it is a characteristic of Fa Shao (so-called ‘fever') in the exterior stage of
invasions of Wind that the dorsum of the hands feels hot compared with the
palms and the upper back feels hot compared with the chest. 1 This objective hot
feeling of the patient's body may or may not be accompanied by an actual fever.
Indeed, in fevers of internal origin, there may even be cases when the patient has
an actual low-grade fever and the body feels cold to the touch.
   Thus, it is important to remember that, in the context of exterior conditions
from invasions of Wind, ‘fever' indicates the objective hot feeling of the patient's
body (with or without an actual raised body temperature) and not a feeling of
heat; in fact, as described above, the patient feels cold.

          ‘Fever' does not necessarily indicate a raised temperature: it
      indicates that the patient's forehead and dorsum of hands feel hot
      to the touch. The patient may or may not have an actual fever.

     Simultaneous fever and feeling of cold
   When the symptom of shivers and feeling cold occurs simultaneously with
the objective sign of the patient's body feeling hot to the touch (or having an
actual fever), this indicates an acute invasion of external Wind and it denotes
that the pathogenic factor is still on the Exterior. In particular, it is the symptoms
of shivering and feeling cold that indicate that the pathogenic factor is on the
Exterior: the moment the patient does not feel cold any longer but feels hot and,
if in bed, throws oﬀ the blankets, this means that the pathogenic factor is in the
Interior and it has turned into Heat.

     Pathology of fever
   The fever, or hot feeling of the body in external invasions of Wind, is due to
the struggle between the body's Qi (Upright Qi) and the external pathogenic
factor. Thus, the strength of the fever (or hot feeling of the body) reflects the
intensity of this struggle; this depends on the relative strengths of the external
pathogenic factor and the Upright Qi. The stronger the external pathogenic
factor, the higher is the fever (or hot feeling of the body); likewise, the stronger
the Upright Qi, the higher is the fever (or hot feeling of the body). Thus the fever
will be highest when both the external pathogenic factor and the Upright Qi are
strong.
   The relative strength of the pathogenic factor and the Upright Qi is only one
factor which determines the intensity of the fever (or hot feeling of the body).
Another is simply the constitution of a person: a person with a Yang constitution
(i.e. with predominance of Yang) will be more prone to a higher fever (or hot
feeling of the body).

          The intensity of fever in exterior conditions is related to the
      struggle between the Upright Qi and the external pathogenic
      factor and has nothing to do with whether the pathogenic factor is
      Wind-Cold or Wind-Heat.

     Degrees of fever
   Thus, there are three possible degrees of fever (or hot feeling of the body); the
pa erns underlying these are listed in Box 43.6 .

          BOX 43.6         DEGREES OF EXTERIOR FEVER
          • Strong pathogenic factor and strong Upright Qi : high fever
      (or hot feeling of the body)
          • Strong pathogenic factor with weak Upright Qi or vice
      versa : medium fever (or hot feeling of the body)
          • Weak pathogenic factor and weak Upright Qi : low fever (or
      hot feeling of the body) or no fever

     Wind-Cold And Wind-Heat
Factors determining the development of Wind-Cold or Wind-Heat
   The constitution of a person is the main factor which determines whether a
person who falls prey to an invasion of Wind develops Wind-Cold or Wind-
Heat. Were it not so, in cold northern countries nobody should fall prey to
invasions of Wind-Heat, which is not the case. This is also the reason why, in
children, invasions of Wind-Heat are far more prevalent than Wind-Cold: this is
because children are naturally Yang in nature compared with adults. There are,
however, also new, artificial factors which may predispose a person to invasions
of Wind-Heat when succumbing to Wind, such as living in very dry, centrally
heated places, working in hot conditions (e.g. cooks, metal workers), etc.

    Clinical manifestations of Wind-Heat and Wind-Cold
   Although a fever is more likely to occur in invasions of Wind-Heat, the
diﬀerentiation between Wind-Heat and Wind-Cold is not made on the basis of
the intensity of aversion to cold and fever (or a hot feeling of the body). Other
factors such as the tongue and other symptoms help us to diﬀerentiate between
Wind-Cold and Wind-Heat. These are listed in Table 43.2 .

    Wind-Cold: differentiation between ‘Attack of Wind' and
‘Attack of Cold'
   So far we have talked about Wind-Cold in general but the ‘Discussion of
Cold-induced Diseases' diﬀerentiates between two types of Wind-Cold
invasions: one with prevalence of Wind, called ‘A ack of Wind', and the other
with prevalence of Cold, called ‘A ack of Cold'. The A ack of Wind is described
in Clause 2 of the ‘Discussion of Cold-induced Diseases': ‘The Greater-Yang
pa ern with fever, sweating, aversion to wind and a Floating and Slowed-down
pulse is called A ack of Wind '. 2 It may seem strange that the pulse is Slowed-
down in this pa ern as Wind is a Yang pathogenic factor that moves and opens.
However, it is also true that Wind may cause stiﬀness (as in occipital stiﬀness in
Wind-Cold invasions), rigidity and paralysis; thus it is quite possible for the
A ack of Wind of external Wind-Cold to cause a Slowed-down pulse (which is
less slow than the Slow pulse). The commentary to Clause 2 confirms that Huan
in this case means a ‘moderate and slow (Chi ) pulse'. 3
   Clause 3 describes the A ack of Cold: ‘The Greater-Yang pa ern with fever
or no fever, aversion to cold, body aches, retching and Tight pulse on both Yin
and Yang, is called A ack of Cold' . 4
   In A ack of Wind, the patient's Nutritive Qi is more deficient than in the
A ack of Cold and this causes a slight sweating. Other symptoms are tabulated
in Table 43.3 .

   Apart from Wind-Heat and Wind-Cold, simultaneous shivers and fever may
also occur with invasions of Summer-Heat, Damp-Heat and Dry-Heat.

     Summer-Heat
   Summer-Heat is a type of Wind-Heat and therefore manifests with a
simultaneous feeling of cold and fever. The clinical manifestations usually are:
fever (or hot feeling of the body), shivers, no sweating, headache, a feeling of
heaviness, an uncomfortable sensation in the epigastrium, irritability, thirst,
tongue Red in the front or sides with a sticky white coating, and a Soggy and
Rapid pulse.
   The tongue coating is white because the pathogenic factor is on the Exterior.

     Damp-Heat
   Damp-Heat from external origin also manifests with a simultaneous feeling
of cold and fever at its very beginning stages. The clinical manifestations are
usually fever that is worse in the afternoon, body hot to touch, aversion to cold,
shivers, swollen glands, headache, a feeling of heaviness, a feeling of oppression
of the epigastrium, sticky taste, thirst with no desire to drink, sticky white
tongue coating, and a Soggy-Slow pulse.
   The pulse is Slow because of the obstructive influence of Dampness. The
tongue coating is white because the pathogenic factor is on the Exterior.
     Dry-Heat
   Dry-Heat is a type of Wind-Heat and therefore manifests with a simultaneous
feeling of cold and fever. The clinical manifestations usually are: fever, slight
aversion to cold, shivers, slight sweating, dry skin, nose, mouth and throat, dry
cough, sore throat, Dry tongue with thin white coating, and a Floating-Rapid
pulse.
   The tongue coating is white because the pathogenic factor is on the Exterior.

     ALTERNATING FEELING OF COLD AND
FEELING OF HEAT
   An alternating feeling of cold and feeling of heat (or fever) should not be
confused with the simultaneous feeling of cold and fever which characterizes
invasions of external Wind. There are two main diﬀerences. First, in alternating
feeling of cold and feeling of heat, the feeling of heat is a subjective feeling of the
patient, whereas in the simultaneous aversion to cold and fever of external
invasions the feeling of heat is an objective feeling of heat on palpation of the
patient's forehead and hands. Secondly, in alternating feeling of cold and feeling
of heat, the cold and hot sensations alternate whereas in aversion to cold and
fever, they are simultaneous.
   Alternating feeling of cold and feeling of heat occurs also in external
invasions, but only those aﬀecting the Lesser-Yang channels (whereas aversion to
cold and fever occurs in external pa erns aﬀecting the Greater-Yang channels).
This symptom is a chief symptom of the Lesser-Yang pa ern within the Six
Stages (Chapter 105 ) or of the Gall-Bladder Heat pa ern within the Four Levels
(Chapter 104 ). The la er is also a Lesser-Yang-type of pa ern but with the
prevalence of heat rather than cold. This is reflected in the patient's sensations in
that the feeling of heat is predominant over the feeling of cold.

            • ‘Feeling of heat' in alternating cold and hot feeling is
         subjective.
            • ‘Feeling of heat' (or fever) in simultaneous aversion to cold
         and fever is objective, i.e. the patient's body feels hot to the touch.
   Case history 43.1 illustrates a pa ern causing alternating feeling of heat and
feeling of cold.

                   Case History 43.1
            An 18-year-old girl complained of an acute illness manifesting
         with alternation of shivers and feeling of heat, swollen glands,
         sore throat, headache, lethargy and a feeling of heaviness of the
         head. These symptoms had started 3 weeks before the
      consultation. Her tongue was Red with red points in the front
      with a thin yellow coating. Her pulse was Floating in general,
      especially on both Front positions and slightly Slippery on the
      right side.
          Diagnosis:
         This is a very clear case of acute invasion of Wind-Damp-Heat
      still at the exterior level at the time of consultation. It is still at the
      exterior level because she still experiences shivers. Together with
      the typical symptoms of Wind-Heat, there is also acute, exterior
      Dampness manifesting with swollen glands, a feeling of heaviness
      of the head and the Slippery quality on the right side of the pulse.

    FEELING OF HEAT FROM INTERNAL
CAUSES
   A subjective feeling of heat may be caused by Full-Heat or Empty-Heat of
any organ. In Full-Heat, the feeling of heat is somewhat more intense than in
Empty-Heat; another diﬀerence is that in Empty-Heat, the feeling of heat tends
to be more marked in the afternoon or evening. Also, Empty-Heat is
characterized by a feeling of heat especially in the Yin areas of the body, and
particularly in the chest, palms and soles. Of course, the diﬀerentiation between
Full-Heat and Empty-Heat is done on the basis of other manifestations such as
thirst, complexion and most of all the tongue, which will be Red with a coating
in Full-Heat and Red without coating in Empty-Heat. The main diﬀerentiating
manifestations of Full-Heat and Empty-Heat are shown in Box 43.7 .

          BOX 43.7          DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN
      FULL-HEAT AND EMPTY-HEAT
        Full-Heat
         • Usually a more intense heat
         • Generalized over the body or in the face
         • Not related to time of day
         • Intense thirst
         • Pronounced irritability
         • Complexion red all over
         • Red tongue with thick, dry yellow coating
         • Overflowing-Rapid pulse
          Empty-Heat
         • Less intense heat
         • Often on chest, soles and palms
         • Worse in afternoon and evening
         • Dry mouth with a desire to sip drinks
          • Vague anxiety
          • Redness on the cheekbones
          • Red tongue without coating
          • Floating-Empty and Rapid pulse
   With Full-Heat, the organs that are most often involved are the Liver, Heart,
Stomach and Lungs; with Empty-Heat, the organs that are most often involved
are the Kidneys, Heart, Stomach and Lungs.
   We should bear in mind that, in some cases, a person may feel hot in general
but simultaneously experience cold feet, for example. Therefore, when a patient
replies aﬃrmatively to the question ‘Do you have a tendency to feel hot in
general?', our questioning should not stop there; rather it should continue in
order to ascertain whether there is any cold feeling in any particular parts of the
body. For a discussion on the clinical significance of simultaneous (and
contradictory) hot and cold feelings in internal conditions, see below.

          When a patient feels hot in general, remember to ask about
      any possible cold feeling in a particular part of the body (and vice
      versa).

     INTERIOR FEVER
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 82
   By ‘fever' is meant the situation when the patient has a fever but no
simultaneous cold feeling or shivers; thus, we are now discussing interior fevers,
which, it should be remembered, may be of external or internal origin. An
interior fever of external origin is one caused by an exterior pathogenic factor
(such as Wind-Heat, Wind-Cold or Damp-Heat) which has penetrated into the
Interior and caused a fever; an interior fever of internal origin stems from an
internal disharmony such as interior Heat, Yin deficiency, Qi or Blood deficiency
and Blood stasis (Figs 43.10 and 43.11 ).

      FIG. 43.11   External and internal causes of interior fevers
   In some of the pa erns discussed, there may not be an actual fever but only a
feeling of heat: the pathology and pathogenesis of interior fever or feeling of heat
is the same. Generally speaking, acute fevers are characterized by an actual
fever, (i.e. raised body temperature), whereas chronic ‘fevers' may be
characterized simply by a feeling of heat without a rise in body temperature.
Thus, contrary to the situation in exterior syndromes when ‘fever' indicates an
objective hot feeling of the body, in chronic interior syndromes with fever of
internal origin, ‘fever' may indicate a subjective feeling of heat.
   There are three degrees of interior fever (or hot body sensation); these are
listed in Box 43.8 .

           BOX 43.8             DEGREES OF INTERIOR FEVER
          • Slight fever (Wei Re ): the fever is very low and the body is
      only slightly hot: the patient may not be aware of having a fever
          • Fever (Fa Re ): the body temperature is raised (or the body
      feels quite hot to the touch): the patient is aware of the fever and
      has a feeling of heat
          • Strong fever (Zhuang Re ): the fever is very high, the body is
      very hot to the touch, the patient has an intense feeling of heat and
      throws oﬀ bedclothes

     Acute Fever
   When discussing fevers of internal origin, it is important to diﬀerentiate
between acute and chronic fever. Acute interior fevers usually develop from the
acute stage of an invasion of external Wind: both Wind-Cold and Wind-Heat
may lead to an interior fever. Thus, the fever discussed here is primarily an acute
fever deriving from external causes but at the interior stage. In such acute fevers
the identification of pa erns according to the Four Levels provides the best
framework of interpretation and is clinically more relevant than the
identification of pa erns according to the Six Stages. However, there may be
other acute interior fevers that are of internal origin, for example from Damp-
Heat in the Liver and Gall-Bladder (febrile episode of cholecystitis) , or Damp-
Heat in the Bladder (cystitis with fever) (Fig 43.12 ).

     The Four Levels
   The Four Levels pa erns are discussed in Chapter 104 . Within the Four
Levels, the Defensive-Qi level is the only Exterior one and therefore there is
simultaneous fever and shivering with a cold feeling. At the other three levels
(Qi, Nutritive Qi and Blood), Heat is in the Interior and the fever is interior. The
identification of pa erns according to the Four Levels describes the
symptomatology of invasions of Wind-Heat. However, fever, to a lesser degree,
may be present also in invasions of Wind-Cold, for which the identification of
pa erns according to the Six Stages is used.
    The three interior levels, Qi, Nutritive-Qi and Blood levels, within the Four
Levels represent three diﬀerent depths of penetration of the Heat, the Qi being
the most superficial (or rather least deep) and Blood the deepest. At the Qi level,
the Upright Qi is still strong and it engages in a fight with the pathogenic factors
leading to a high fever and acute, strong manifestations characterized by
restlessness, high fever, profuse sweating, etc. At the Nutritive-Qi and Blood
levels, the Upright Qi is injured, the Heat has injured the fluids and there is Yin
deficiency. These levels are usually characterized by a fever at night and by the
Mind being aﬀected, causing delirium, severe mental restlessness and, in severe
cases, coma. At the Blood level, internal Wind can develop and bleeding occurs.
At the Blood level and, to a lesser extent, at the Nutritive-Qi level, there are
maculae.
    The tongue is an important and objective sign to diﬀerentiate the Qi level
from the Nutritive-Qi level andthe Blood levels: at the Qi level the tongue is Red
and has a thick coating, whereas at the Nutritive-Qi and Blood levels the tongue
is dark Red and has no coating.
    The clinical manifestation of the Four Levels in fever is summarized in Box
43.9 .

            BOX 43.9         THE FOUR LEVELS IN A
         NUTSHELL
            • Defensive-Qi level : fever, aversion to cold
            • Qi level : fever, feeling of heat, thirst
            • Nutritive-Qi level : fever at night, mental confusion,
         maculae
            • Blood level : fever at night, mental confusion, maculae,
         bleeding
    The clinical manifestations of the Defensive-Qi level, which causes a
simultaneous feeling of cold and fever, have already been discussed above. The
detailed clinical manifestations of the main pa erns appearing at the Qi,
Nutritive-Qi and Blood levels are described below.

     Heat in the Lungs (Qi level)
    Clinical manifestations Fever, cough with yellow sputum, sweating, thirst, a
feeling of oppression or pain of the chest, Red tongue with sticky yellow coating
and Rapid-Overflowing pulse.
    This is one of the pa erns appearing at the Qi level within the Four Levels; it
is characterized by acute, interior Lung-Heat. From a Western perspective, it
could correspond to acute bronchitis, pneumonia or pleurisy. In this case there is
an actual fever as well as an objective hot feeling of the patient's body.

     Phlegm-Heat in the Lungs (Qi level)
   Clinical manifestations Fever, cough with abundant sticky yellow sputum,
thirst, sweating, a feeling of oppression of the chest, nausea, Red tongue with
sticky yellow coating and Rapid-Slippery pulse.
   This is one of the possible pa erns appearing at the Qi level within the Four
Levels; it is characterized by acute, interior Lung-Heat with Phlegm.

    Heat in Bright Yang - channel pattern
   Clinical manifestations Fever, sweating, intense thirst, Big or Overflowing
pulse and Red tongue with yellow coating.
   This corresponds to acute, interior Heat in the Stomach channel and its
manifestations are described by the Stomach-Heat level within the Four Levels
or the Bright-Yang channel pa ern within the Six Stages. This pa ern is often
summarized in a nutshell as the ‘four big', that is, high fever, intense thirst,
profuse sweating and Overflowing or Big pulse.

    Heat in Bright Yang - organ pattern
   Clinical manifestations Fever, abdominal pain and fullness, dry stools,
constipation, thirst, Red tongue with a thick, dry yellow, brown or black coating
and Deep-Full-Rapid pulse.
   This is the Dry-Heat in the Intestines level within the Four Levels and is the
same as the Bright Yang - organ pa ern within the Six Stages.

    Damp-Heat in the Stomach and Intestines
   Clinical manifestations Fever, thirst with no desire to drink, loose stools,
abdominal pain, a feeling of heaviness, Red tongue with sticky yellow coating
and Slippery-Rapid pulse.
   This is Damp-Heat in the Stomach and Intestines level within the Four
Levels.

    Heat at Nutritive-Qi level
   Clinical manifestations Fever at night, thirst, dry mouth with no desire to
drink, mental restlessness, delirium, aphasia, coma, Red tongue without coating,
Fine-Rapid pulse.
   This is Heat at the Nutritive-Qi level within the Four Levels.

    Heat at Blood level
   Clinical manifestations Fever at night, thirst, mental restlessness, bleeding,
convulsions, tremor, Red tongue without coating, Fine-Rapid pulse.
   This is Heat at the Blood level within the Four Levels.
   In addition to the above interior pa erns with internal fever of the Four
Levels, two commons pa erns from interior Heat which may give rise to an
acute, internal fever are Damp-Heat in the Gall-Bladder and Liver (as in acute
cholecystitis) and Damp-Heat in the Bladder (as in acute cystitis).
     Damp-Heat in the Gall-Bladder and Liver
   Clinical manifestations Fever, bi er and sticky taste, hypochondrial pain
which may extend to the right shoulder and scapula, irritability, a feeling of
oppression of the chest, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, tongue with Red sides and
sticky yellow tongue coating and Wiry-Slippery-Rapid pulse.

     Damp-Heat in the Bladder
   Clinical manifestations Fever, burning of urination, diﬃcult urination,
scanty and dark urine, blood in the urine, mental restlessness, sticky yellow
tongue coating on the root of the tongue and Slippery-Rapid pulse.

     Chronic Fever
   Chronic interior fevers may be due to Deficiency or Excess. Yin deficiency is a
common and obvious cause of chronic interior fever, but Qi and Blood deficiency
may also cause it. Among the Full causes of internal fever are stagnant Liver-Qi
turned into Heat and Blood stasis. Thus, there are five main causes of chronic
interior fever:

            • Empty-Heat from Yin deficiency
            • Qi deficiency
            • Blood deficiency
            • stagnant Liver-Qi turned into Heat
            • Blood stasis.

     Empty-Heat from Yin deficiency
   Clinical manifestations Low-grade fever or feeling of heat in the afternoon or
evening, five-palm heat, malar flush, thirst with desire to drink in small sips, dry
mouth and throat at night, mental restlessness, night sweating, insomnia, dream-
disturbed sleep, dry stools, dark-scanty urination, a thin red line on the inside of
the lower eyelid, Red tongue without coating and with cracks, and Fine-Rapid
pulse.
   These are the general symptoms of Empty-Heat deriving from Yin deficiency;
they may arise from the Lungs, Heart, Stomach, Spleen, Liver and Kidneys.
Other accompanying symptoms (or more accentuated symptoms) according to
the organ involved are listed in Box 43.10 .

            BOX 43.10         CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
         OF EMPTY-HEAT FROM YIN DEFICIENCY
            • Lungs: dry throat, dry cough, malar flush
            • Heart: insomnia, mental restlessness, dream-disturbed sleep,
         malar flush, Red tip of the tongue
          • Spleen: dry lips, dry stools
          • Liver: dry eyes, red eyes, dream-disturbed sleep, Red sides
      of the tongue
          • Kidneys: dizziness, tinnitus
          • Stomach: dry mouth, bleeding gums

     Qi deficiency
   Clinical manifestations Low-grade fever or feeling of heat that is aggravated
by overwork, dizziness, tiredness, depression, muscular weakness, spontaneous
sweating, shortness of breath, loose stools, poor appetite, weak voice, Pale
tongue and Weak or Empty pulse.
   This fever is caused by a severe deficiency of Qi, usually of the Spleen,
Stomach and Lungs, and a deficiency of the Original Qi. This situation was
described by Li Dong Yuan in the famous classic ‘Discussion on Stomach and
Spleen' (Pi Wei Lun ) (see Bibliography). He said that overwork and irregular diet
weaken the Qi of the Stomach and Spleen and the Original Qi, which resides in
the Lower Field of Elixir (Dan Tian ); here it shares a place with the
(physiological) Minister Fire. If the Minister Fire is stirred by overwork and
emotional problems, it becomes pathological, ‘displaces' the Original Qi in the
Lower Field of Elixir and it rises upwards causing a low-grade fever or a feeling
of heat (Fig 43.13 ).

      FIG. 43.13   Pathology of Yin Fire
   Li Dong Yuan called this pathological Minister Fire a ‘thief' of the Original
Qi; the Heat generated by the pathological Minister Fire is called ‘Yin Fire' and it
is neither Full- nor Empty-Heat, although it is more similar to the la er. Li Dong
Yuan said that this Yin Fire is treated not by clearing it with bi er-cold herbs but
by tonifying the Original Qi with sweet-warm herbs: as the Minister Fire and the
Original Qi share the sameplace, tonifying the Original Qi will automatically
displace and subdue the pathological Minister Fire.
   The representative prescription to subdue Yin Fire is Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang
Tonifying the Centre and Benefiting Qi Decoction, within which Ren Shen Radix
Ginseng tonifies the Original Qi.
   This condition of Yin Fire and feeling of heat deriving from Qi and Blood
deficiency is very common nowadays and is frequently seen in chronic cases of
ME (CFIDS, postviral fatigue syndrome) and other modern autoimmune
diseases, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.

    Blood deficiency
   Clinical manifestations Low-grade fever or feeling of heat in the afternoon,
dizziness, tingling, blurred vision, poor memory, tiredness, depression, scanty
periods, palpitations, dull and pale complexion, pale lips, Pale-Thin tongue and
Fine or Choppy pulse.
   This fever is caused by a severe depletion of Blood and by Empty-Heat
resulting from it; it is more common in women and it may occur after childbirth.

    Stagnant Liver-Qi turned into Heat
   Clinical manifestations Chronic low-grade fever or feeling of heat that comes
and goes according to the emotional state (it comes when the person is upset),
volatile mood, irritability, a feeling of oppression and distension of the chest and
hypochondrium, dry throat, sighing, a bi er taste, irregular periods,
premenstrual tension, Red tongue with redder sides and thin-yellow coating and
Rapid-Wiry pulse.
   This is due to Liver-Heat generated by chronic Liver-Qi stagnation and is
usually caused by chronic emotional problems.

    Blood stasis
   Clinical manifestations Low-grade fever or feeling of heat in the afternoon or
evening, dry mouth, abdominal pain, dry skin and nails, dark complexion,
purple lips, Purple tongue and Choppy or Firm pulse.
   This is chronic Blood stasis and it is usually related to the Liver. The
manifestations of dryness are due not to Yin deficiency but to Blood stasis. Due
to the interactions and interchange between Blood and Body Fluids, when Blood
stagnates for a long time, it cannot interchange with the Body Fluids and these
fail to moisten the body. Fever from chronic Blood stasis is frequently seen in
cancer.

    FIVE-PALM HEAT
   This is a feeling of heat in the palms, soles and chest, which is also sometimes
called five-centre heat or five-heart heat; this may or may not be accompanied by
an actual fever. It is usually accompanied by mental restlessness, night sweating
and insomnia. This is frequently seen in practice; however, it may sometimes
manifest only in the soles and palms, or palms and chest.
   Yin deficiency of any organ may cause five-palm heat: Lungs, Heart, Liver,
Spleen, Kidneys, Stomach. However, there are other, less common, possible
causes of five-palm heat: these include Blood deficiency, Latent Heat in the
Lesser Yin and Liver-Fire.
   In Blood deficiency, the five-palm heat is experienced mainly in the afternoon
and is accompanied by other symptoms of Blood deficiency. This occurs almost
exclusively in women.
   Latent Heat in the Lesser Yin is characterized by Heat in the Kidneys and is
frequently seen in ME (postviral fatigue syndrome). The main manifestations are
a low-grade fever or feeling of heat in the afternoon or evening, feeling cold in
the morning, dizziness, tinnitus and night sweating.
   Liver-Fire may also cause five-palm heat although not frequently; this
symptom will be accompanied by other manifestations of Liver-Fire.
   Box 43.11 summarizes the pa erns underlying five-palm heat.

          B O X 4 3 . 11     FIVE-PALM HEAT
         • Yin deficiency of any organ: this is the most common pa ern
         • Blood deficiency: more common in women and occurs more
      frequently in the afternoon
         • Latent Heat in the Lesser Yin: occurs more frequently in the
      evening with low-grade fever
         • Liver-Fire: severe five-palm heat with a sudden onset (not
      common)

  CONTRADICTORY FEELINGS OF COLD
AND HEAT IN INTERNAL CONDITIONS
   Contradictory hot and cold feelings are very common especially in women
and especially those over the age of 40. This is due to four possible causes:

         • simultaneous deficiency of Kidney-Yin and Kidney-Yang
         • Blood deficiency with Empty-Heat
         • disharmony of the Penetrating Vessel
         • Yin Fire.

     Simultaneous Deficiency Of Kidney-Yin And
Kidney-Yang
   A simultaneous deficiency of Kidney-Yin and Kidney-Yang is very common
in women over the age of 40; indeed, it is probably more the norm than the
exception. Kidney-Yin and Kidney-Yang have a common root and, especially
after 40, a deficiency of one often involves also a deficiency of the other, albeit in
diﬀerent degrees. Thus, when there is a deficiency of both Kidney-Yang and
Kidney-Yin with a predominance of the la er there will be dizziness, tinnitus,
night sweating, malar flush, five-palm heat and a feeling of heat, but possibly
also cold feet; when there is a predominance of Kidney-Yang deficiency there
will be dizziness, backache, tinnitus, frequent urination, a pronounced feeling of
cold and cold feet, but possibly also a feeling of heat in the afternoon.

     Blood Deficiency With Empty-Heat
   Blood deficiency may also cause some Empty-Heat and therefore
contradictory hot and cold symptoms. In fact, Blood deficiency may cause cold
hands, but when Empty-Heat arises from it in chronic cases there may be a
feeling of heat in the face.

     Disharmony Of The Penetrating Vessel
   Contradictory hot and cold symptoms may be caused by a disharmony of the
Penetrating Vessel. When this vessel is deficient (which involves a Kidney
deficiency), a deficiency of Qi in its descending branch may cause cold feet while
the ascending rebellious Qi may cause a feeling of heat in the face.

     Yin Fire
   Finally, Yin Fire may cause a person to feel cold in general and experience
occasional feeling of heat in the face. The pathology of Yin Fire has already been
explained above.
   Box 43.12 summarizes the pa erns underlying contradictory feeling of heat
and cold.

            BOX 43.12          CONTRADICTORY FEELING

    INTRODUCTION

    WHY WE ASK
   The area of questioning surrounding the emotions experienced by the patient
is one of the most important, if not the most important one. Emotional causes of
disease play a very prominent role in the aetiology and clinical manifestations of
most of our patients. Therefore we should always ask patients about their
emotional life. However, some patients may regard an enquiry about their
emotional life as an intrusion and we should be sensitive about this.
   The emotional state of the patient reflects of course the state of their Mind
and Spirit and the findings from interrogation need to be carefully integrated
with those gleaned from observation, particularly observation of the lustre (shen
) of the eyes. In addition, the state of the patient's Mind and Spirit is an
important prognostic factor.
    WHEN WE ASK
   Enquiry about a patient's emotional life must be closely integrated with
observation (especially of the eyes, complexion and tongue), with palpation (of
the pulse) and with hearing (voice).
   If the emotional condition is not the presenting problem, I generally ask
about a patient's emotional life towards the end of the consultation to try to find
the cause of the disease. In many cases, the emotional state of the patient is the
main presenting problem; for example, patients may come to us because they are
depressed or anxious. In other cases, the emotional state of the patient is the
underlying cause of physical symptoms; for example, a patient may complain of
tiredness and digestive symptoms when frustration and resentment may be the
cause of the condition.
   Unless the patient comes specifically seeking help for an emotional state such
as depression, irritability or anxiety, I generally ask about the patient's emotions
when the pa ern emerging from the interrogation, together with observation of
the eyes and tongue and palpation of the pulse, strongly points to an emotional
cause of disease. For example, if the Lung pulse is somewhat full and the patient
looks sad, I may try and find out whether sadness or grief has been experienced
that has not been expressed (the fullness of the Lung pulse would indicate this).
   If the Heart pulse is Overflowing and there is a Heart crack on the tongue, I
may enquire whether the patient has suﬀered from a shock. If the Lung pulse is
particularly Weak and without wave and the eyes lack lustre, I may explore
whether events in the patient's life have caused sadness or grief. If the pulse is
Wiry on all positions I ask the patient whether some life situation is causing
frustration, anger or resentment. If the Heart pulse is Choppy, the complexion
dull, the eyes lustreless and the voice weak and weepy, I will try and determine
whether the patient is sad.
   There are two main reasons why I ask a patient to confirm what I suspect
from observation, palpation and hearing. First, it engages patients more with the
treatment and, by making them aware of a possible emotional cause of their
symptoms, it may further their healing process. Secondly, even if the eyes lack
lustre, there is a deep Heart crack on the tongue and the pulse is Sad, this may be
caused by a severe physical illness such as cancer, or a treatment such as
chemotherapy (which may weaken even the strongest of Spirits).
   It is important to be sensitive when asking about the emotional state of the
patient (if this is not the presenting problem) and often it is observation that
gives us a clue about the emotional state, in which case I would ask the patient
about it. For example, a patient may come in complaining of tiredness and
premenstrual breast distension: if the eyes of the patient lack lustre, I would
suspect emotional stress to be the cause of the problem and I would
circumspectly ask the patient about it.
   It is important to mention, however, that in most cases of treating emotional
symptoms, or symptoms which are caused by emotional problems, observation
should take precedence over what a patient verbally reports. It is most often
when we see beyond what a patient is telling us that we find the true cause of a
disease.

    HOW WE ASK
   As mentioned above, we must use great sensitivity when asking patients
about their emotions.
   First of all, we should ask only if they appear willing to talk about their
emotions and respect their wish if they do not want to do so. If I suspect that
emotional stress is the cause of a problem I ask questions like ‘Have you suﬀered
any shock in the past?', ‘Do you tend to feel irritable about some situation?' or
‘Do you sometimes feel sad?', etc.
   Of course, if the patient comes to us specifically for an emotional condition,
the questioning is conducted diﬀerently as the patient will openly volunteer the
information.

    DEPRESSION
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 79
   Depression is a very common symptom in Western patients, even though
some patients may not admit to being depressed and others may not even
recognize that they are depressed.

    Definition Of Depression
   ‘Depression' is a modern Western term which indicates a change in mood
ranging from a very mild feeling of despondency to the most abject depression
and despair. In mild depression the change in mood varies and is not
permanent, whereas in severe depression the change in mood is fixed and
persists over a period of months or years. Severe depression is also accompanied
by characteristic changes in behaviour, a itude, thinking eﬃciency and
physiological functioning. Of course, it is normal to experience a temporary
feeling of depression following adverse life events such as bereavement. In
distinguishing a normal reaction from pathological depression a quantitative
judgement has to be made. If the precipitant seems inadequate, or the depression
appears too severe or too long lasting, the condition may be regarded as
abnormal. In addition, the severity and incapacity in depressive illness diﬀer
qualitatively as well as quantitatively from depressed feelings that are part of
normal experiences.
   Depression is twice as common in women as in men and its onset increases
towards middle age. The main symptoms of depression are depressed mood,
loss of interest, self-esteem or motivation, fatigue, anxiety, insomnia and loss of
appetite. In very severe cases, the patient never comes out of an extremely
depressed mood, is unable to experience any pleasure at any time, is in u er
despair and may be suicidal. A major depressive syndrome has the following
characteristics:

           • very depressed mood most of the day nearly every day
           • markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all
        activities most of the day, nearly every day
           • significant weight loss (or gain), decrease (or increase) in
        appetite
           • insomnia or sleepiness
           • psychomotor agitation or retardation every day
           • fatigue nearly every day
           • feelings of worthlessness or guilt (which may be delusional)
        nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being ill)
           • diminished ability to think or concentrate, indecisiveness
        nearly every day
           • recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation
        without a specific plan or a suicide a empt or a specific plan for
        commi ing suicide.
   In addition to the above manifestations, a major depressive syndrome is also
defined by the absence of the following: an organic factor, a normal reaction to
bereavement, delusions or hallucinations in the absence of mood symptoms,
schizophrenia, delusional disorder, psychotic disorder. 1

     Diagnosis Of Depression
   Asking patients about feelings of depression should always be part of our
questions about the patient's emotional state and it should be carried out with
sensitivity and tact. In fact, some patients will not want to admit to being
depressed, some will admit to being depressed but do not necessarily want to
talk about it, and others may not even realize that they are in a state of
depression. These patients will often complain only of physical symptoms such
as extreme tiredness, lack of motivation and feeling cold, preferring not to face
up to the fact that they may be depressed. In China this is more the norm than
the exception as Chinese patients will seldom complain of feeling ‘depressed'
and somatization of their feelings of depression into bodily symptoms is often
seen.
   Signs of depression In patients who are not aware of being depressed,
Chinese diagnosis often enables us to recognize the true condition of the
patient's mental-emotional state. In fact there are certain signs that point to
mental depression as the root cause of the patient's problems and these are:
            • the complexion
            • the eyes
            • the tongue
            • the voice
            • the pulse.
   The complexion of a severely depressed person will lack lustre and will tend
to be greyish or greenish; the eyes will also lack sparkle (shen ); the tongue has a
Red tip and may have a deep Heart crack; and the voice will be low and lacking
vitality.
   The pulse in a depressed person varies according to whether the condition is
primarily Full or Empty. In Full conditions, the pulse feels very Wiry or Wiry
and Slippery, whereas in Empty conditions (especially when sadness and grief
prevail) the pulse is Weak or Choppy, often Short and nearly always lacks a
‘wave' (Sad pulse). Interestingly, very often the pulse of a depressed person may
point to the true cause of the problem being repressed anger; in fact, in some
cases, a depressed patient may display many signs pointing to an Empty
condition (low voice, dull complexion, slow movements) while the pulse is very
Wiry. This usually indicates that the patient's depression is due to repressed
anger. Vice versa, a pulse that is Choppy, Short or Sad indicates that sadness or
grief is the prevalent emotion at the root of the depression.

     Depression In Chinese Medicine
   In Chinese medicine, mental depression was called Yin Yu, which means
‘gloominess' or ‘depression' or, Yu Zheng, which means ‘depression pa ern'. Yu
has the double meaning of ‘depression' and ‘stagnation', which implies that,
according to this theory, mental depression is always caused by a stagnation.
   In fact, the ‘Simple Questions' in Chapter 71 mentions the Five Stagnations of
Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water. 2 The ‘Essential Method of Dan Xi' (Dan Xi
Xin Fa , 1347) describes six stagnations of Qi, Blood, Dampness, Phlegm, Heat
and Food. It says: ‘When Qi and Blood are harmonized, no disease arises. If they
stagnate diseases arise. Many diseases are due to stagnation… stagnation
makes things accumulate so that they cannot flow freely, they would like to rise
but cannot, they would like to descend but cannot, they would like to transform
but cannot … thus the 6 Stagnations come into being.' 3
   The ‘Complete Book of Jing Yue' (Jing Yue Quan Shu, 1624) gives stagnation
an emotional interpretation and talks about Six Stagnations of anger,
pensiveness, worry, sadness, shock and fear. This confirms that all emotions can
lead to stagnation of Qi. It says: ‘In the 6 Stagnations, stagnation is the cause of
the disease. In emotional stagnation, the disease [i.e. the emotion] is the cause of
the stagnation.' 4

     Patterns In Depression
   Chinese books normally ascribe mental depression to Liver-Qi stagnation in
its various manifestations including Liver-Qi stagnation turning into Heat and
Liver-Qi stagnation with Phlegm. In the later stages of mental depression, Empty
pa erns appear. Thus, although in Chinese medicine stagnation and depression
are almost synonymous, Empty pa erns may also cause depression.
   In severe depression, the Liver is always involved owing to its housing the
Ethereal Soul (Hun ). The Ethereal Soul is responsible for our life's dreams, plans,
ideas, projects, relationship with other people, etc. The Ethereal Soul was often
described as ‘the coming and going of the Mind (Shen )': this means that the
Ethereal Soul assists the Mind in giving it the capacity to have dreams, plans,
ideas, projects, etc. In this sense, the Ethereal Soul gives the Mind ‘movement',
outward projection and ability to form relationships with other people, hence its
‘coming and going' described above. On the other hand, the Mind guides and
controls the Ethereal Soul and, most of all, integrates the activity of the Ethereal
Soul within the overall psychic life of the person.
   Thus, if the ‘movement' of the Ethereal Soul is lacking (either through its lack
of activity or through overcontrol of the Mind), the person is depressed; if the
‘movement' of the Ethereal Soul is excessive (either through its overactivity or
through lack of control by the Mind), the person may display manic behaviour
(bearing in mind that the la er may vary in intensity and seriousness from full-
blown bipolar disease to much less severe manifestations that are relatively
common also in mentally healthy individuals).
   When a person is severely depressed, the Ethereal Soul is not ‘coming and
going' enough, and therefore the person lacks dreams, has lost faith in the
future, does not know which direction to take in life and has a feeling of loss,
isolation and separation. From this point of view, many Liver (and other organs)
pa erns, and not just Liver-Qi stagnation, may cause depression. When the
Ethereal Soul ‘comes and goes' too much, the person may develop manic
behaviour; in this case, the person has lots of dreams, projects and ideas but
nothing comes to fruition because of the chaotic state of the Ethereal Soul and
the lack of control of this by the Mind.
   Figure 44.1 illustrates the two states of the Ethereal Soul: when it ‘comes and
goes' too much; and when it does not ‘come and go' enough.

      FIG. 44.1   The ‘coming and going' of the Ethereal Soul
   Essential to the proper movement of the Ethereal Soul is its restraint by the
Mind. The Mind (Shen of the Heart) needs to restrain the Ethereal Soul (but not
too much) and integrate the material coming from it into the totality of the
psyche. If the Mind controls and restrains the Ethereal Soul too much,
depression ensues; if the Mind fails to control and restrain the Ethereal Soul,
manic behaviours may result (Fig 44.2 ).

      FIG. 44.2   Relationship between the Mind and the Ethereal Soul
   The lack of ‘movement' of the Ethereal Soul and hence depression may be
due to pathogenic factors inhibiting the Ethereal Soul (e.g. Liver-Qi stagnation),
or to a deficiency of the Liver, Spleen or Kidneys not stimulating the Ethereal
Soul. The excessive movement of the Ethereal Soul and hence manic behaviour
may be due to pathogenic factors overstimulating the Ethereal Soul (e.g. Fire or
Phlegm-Fire), or to the lack of anchoring of this Soul from a deficiency of Liver-
Blood or Liver-Yin, or both. Note that Liver-Blood deficiency may lead to lack of
movement of the Ethereal Soul when it is combined with Liver-Qi deficiency
(itself associated with deficiency of Gall-Bladder Qi); otherwise, deficient Liver-
Blood fails to house the Ethereal Soul and this leads to excessive movement.

   When diagnosing the prevailing pa erns in depressed patients, it is
important to diﬀerentiate between Full and Empty conditions; as the mood of
depressed patients is the same in both cases, the main diﬀerentiating signs are
the pulse and the tongue. In Full conditions causing depression, the pulse is
usually Wiry or Slippery and Wiry, while in Empty conditions it is Choppy,
Short or Sad. As depression is often accompanied by anxiety, this is obviously
more pronounced in Full than in Empty conditions.
   The main Full pa erns accompanying depression are:

         • Liver-Qi stagnation
         • stagnant Liver-Qi turning into Heat
         • Liver-Qi stagnation with Qi-Phlegm
         • Phlegm-Fire harassing the Mind
         • Blood stasis
         • Gall-Bladder Heat.
         • diaphragm Heat.
   The main Empty pa erns accompanying depression are:

         • Spleen- and Heart-Blood deficiency
         • Heart-Yang deficiency
         • Liver-Blood deficiency
         • Kidney- and Heart-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat
         • Kidney-Yang deficiency.

    FEAR/ANXIETY
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 79
   A chronic feeling of anxiety (occurring on its own without depression) is very
common in Western patients. A feeling of anxiety includes emotional states akin
to the emotions of fear and worry (two of the seven emotions) in Chinese
medicine. It may be accompanied or caused by deficiency (usually of Blood or
Yin), by Excess (usually Heat) or by a combination of Deficiency and Excess
(usually Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat).
   The main pa erns in anxiety are listed in Box 44.3 .

             Full/Empty
             • Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat
    When there is a deficiency of Blood or Yin, the Mind and Ethereal Soul lose
their ‘residence' in the Heart-Blood and Liver-Blood respectively and the person
becomes anxious and sleeps badly. Conversely, pathogenic factors such as Qi
stagnation, Blood stasis, Heat or Phlegm-Heat may ‘agitate' the Mind and
Ethereal Soul and lead to anxiety and insomnia. In some cases, of course, the
Mind and Ethereal Soul are restless both from a deficiency (e.g. Yin deficiency)
and a pathogenic factor (e.g. Empty-Heat). Figure 44.2 illustrates graphically the
two causes of anxiety, that is, a Deficiency leading to the Mind's not being
‘anchored' (Fig 44.2 , bo om) or a pathogenic factor ‘agitating' the Mind (Fig 44.2
, top).
    As a general rule, the degree of anxiety or fear depends on whether it is
caused by an Empty or a Full condition: in Empty conditions it is mild whereas
in Full conditions it is severe.
    It is usually easy to see whether patients are anxious: they look restless, their
voice may be quivering, they may fidget, talk a lot (in the case of a Full
condition) or be very quiet (in the case of an Empty condition), and may be very
anxious about receiving acupuncture. In a few cases, however, a state of anxiety
may not be apparent in patients who make a brave a empt to hide their true
state. In fact, those who are in a constant state of fear may initially appear to be
calm and grounded. In these cases, the tongue, pulse and eyes may reveal the
patient's state of anxiety or fear. The tongue may have a Red tip, often with a
deep Heart crack, the pulse may be Wiry (in case of a Full condition) or Floating-
Empty (in case of an Empty condition) and Rapid, and the eyes may look
‘unstable' and lack control (see Part 1 , Chapter 6 ).
    Case history 44.1 illustrates a pa ern underlying panic a acks.

                    Case History 44.1
             A 39-year-old woman had been suﬀering from panic a acks
          for the past 6 years. During the a acks her throat would become
          tense, she felt as if she were unable to swallow, she became
          slightly breathless, had palpitations and felt hot. They occurred
          every day and became worse after eating lunch. It was interesting
          to note that when the patient was describing the a acks she
          repeatedly mentioned the word ‘throat'.
             The patient also mentioned that she suﬀered from night
          sweats. Her periods were unproblematic but she did become
          aggressive premenstrually.
   The tongue body was Swollen, slightly peeled on the root and
very slightly Red on the sides and tip. Her pulse was very Weak in
the left Rear position and Overflowing in the left Front position.
    Diagnosis:
   The panic a acks are caused by rebellious Qi in the
Penetrating Vessel. The clinical manifestations displayed by this
patient are fairly typical of the Penetrating Vessel's pathology of
Qi rebelling upwards along its pathway. The Penetrating Vessel
flows up through the abdomen and chest, along the line of the
Kidney channel and flowing through the Heart on its way up to
the throat and face. It therefore influences the Heart and chest
area and, in this case, is causing the symptoms of palpitations and
breathlessness. The symptoms associated with the syndrome of Qi
rebelling upwards in the Penetrating Vessel were called Li Ji ,
which literally means ‘internal urgency', and it indicates a state of
anxiety and panic, as in this case.
   The tension in the throat and diﬃculty in swallowing are
caused by the Qi of the Penetrating Vessel rebelling upwards. The
feeling of heat is caused by the Qi of the Penetrating Vessel
rushing up to the face: this is reflected in the Overflowing quality
of the pulse on the left Front position and the Weak quality on the
left Rear position. This pulse reflects clearly the deficiency of the
Penetrating Vessel in the Lower Burner and the subsequent
rushing upwards of the rebellious Qi to the face. It should be
remembered that the pulse positions reflect not only the organs
but also the areas of the body and their respective channels; in this
case there is Emptiness below (the lower abdomen) and Fullness
above (throat and face) making the pulse Weak in the third
position and Overflowing in the first.
   However, in this case, the pulse is reflecting also a pathology
of the relevant organs. The Weak pulse on the left Rear position
indicates a Kidney deficiency, predominantly of Kidney-Yin, as
evidenced by the peeling of the root of the tongue and the night
sweating. The Overflowing quality on the left Front position
indicates Heart-Heat, which is evidenced also by the Red tip of
the tongue.
   The swelling of the tongue indicates the presence of Phlegm
but the patient has no symptoms of this at present; such cases
highlight the preventative value of tongue diagnosis and I would
therefore resolve Phlegm even in the absence of symptoms.
   The fact that, when describing her symptoms, the patient
repeatedly and emphatically said the word ‘throat' may indicate
that the origin of her condition is an emotional one and that she
      had felt unable to express herself, leading to a feeling of restriction
      in the throat area.

     IRRITABILITY/ANGER
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 79
   Irritability is a common emotional complaint. It includes feeling irritable
frequently, flying oﬀ the handle easily, feeling frustrated, and similar emotional
states. Of the traditional seven emotions, irritability is akin to ‘anger' but it
encompasses a broader range of emotional states and is generally not so intense.
A propensity to anger is generally due to Liver pa erns, whereas irritability may
be caused by many diﬀerent pa erns aﬀecting most organs.
   In particular, the pa erns that may cause irritability include:

          • Qi stagnation
          • Blood stasis
          • Liver-Yang rising
          • Blood deficiency
          • Yin deficiency (with or without Empty-Heat)
          • Heat (including Damp-Heat)
          • Empty-Heat.
   Therefore, irritability may be due to Full or Empty causes; in general, the
irritability from Empty causes is mild and somewhat vague, whereas that due to
Full causes is more intense. The interrogation, therefore, should first of all try to
establish the Full or Empty character of the irritability. In Empty conditions, the
patient may say ‘I get easily annoyed', or ‘Things that did not use to get to me,
now do', etc. In Full conditions, the patient may say something like ‘I feel always
irritable', ‘I feel so on edge that I take it out on my children', etc.
   Box 44.5 links examples of pa erns that may cause irritability and examples
of patients' expressions.

      and take it out on my family .'
          • Lung-Qi stagnation: ‘I feel this lump in the throat, I am on edge
      and feel like bursting into tears .'

           • Liver-Blood deficiency: ‘I feel lost, overwhelmed and on edge and
      I can't cope .'
           • Kidney-Yin deficiency: ‘I feel helpless, unmotivated and on edge
      in the evening .'
           • Heart-Blood deficiency: ‘I feel sad and on edge, and I can't cope
      .'
           • Kidney-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat: ‘I feel hot and
      bothered .'
           • Heart-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat: ‘I feel sad and hot and
      bothered .'
           • Damp-Heat: ‘I feel heavy, yucky and irritable .'

    WORRY/OVERTHINKING
   Many patients complain of a propensity to worry and overthinking and, even
if it is not the presenting condition, many people profess to it when asked. The
emotion of worry is related to the Spleen, and overthinking is more akin to the
Lungs. Worry describes a condition when the patient is prone to imagining the
worst possible outcome in a certain situation, for example a mother who
imagines that her son has been in an accident when he is late home.
Overthinking describes a state where the patient is unable to empty the mind of
repetitive thoughts, which may be of a relatively trivial nature. Molehills may
become mountains in these patients' minds when an apparently insignificant
issue develops into a cause of great concern.
   A propensity to worry and overthinking is most commonly caused by, and
may in turn cause, an Empty condition. A deficiency of Spleen-Qi or Spleen-
Blood, or both, is the most commonly seen pa ern leading to worry and
overthinking. However, deficiency of Heart-Qi, Lung-Qi, Heart-Yin, or of Heart-
or Liver-Blood, or both, may also lead to excessive worrying.
   There are also cases where overthinking is caused by a mixed or Full
condition, namely stagnation of Lung-Qi or Yin deficiency and Empty-Heat.
Worry from a Full condition (such as Lung-Qi stagnation) is usually more
intense and consuming than that from an Empty condition, which a patient may
describe as more ‘lurking in the background'.
   Box 44.6 summarizes pa erns underlying worry and overthinking.

           BOX 44.6         WORRY/OVERTHINKING
           • Heart- and Spleen-Qi deficiency: worry, slightly obsessive
      thinking, slight depression, overthinking, Pale tongue, Empty
      pulse
           • Lung-Qi deficiency: worry, depression, Pale tongue, Empty
      pulse
            • Heart-Blood deficiency: worry, depression, Pale and Thin
       tongue, Choppy or Fine pulse
            • Liver-Blood deficiency: worry which increases after the
       period in women, Pale tongue, Choppy or Fine pulse
            • Heart-Yin deficiency: worry, insomnia, dream-disturbed
       sleep, poor memory, anxiety, propensity to be startled, mental
       restlessness, uneasiness, ‘feeling hot and bothered', Floating-
       Empty pulse, especially on the left Front position
            • Lung-Qi stagnation: worry, mild irritability, depression, a
       feeling of a lump in the throat, tongue slightly Red on the sides in
       the chest areas, pulse very slightly Tight on the right Front position
            • Heart-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat: worry, especially in
       the evening, anxiety, propensity to be startled, mental restlessness,
       uneasiness, ‘feeling hot and bothered', Red tongue, redder on the
       tip, no coating, Floating-Empty and Rapid pulse

     SADNESS/GRIEF
   ‘Sadness', which pertains to the Lungs, must be distinguished from a ‘lack of
joy', which pertains to the Heart. Sadness is an emotional state that weakens the
Lungs and usually manifests with Lung-related symptoms such as a pale
complexion, a weepy and weak voice. Lack of joy, on the other hand, is not an
actual emotional state but a certain lack of vitality deriving from Heart
deficiency; this manifests not with a sad demeanour, but with a flatness and lack
of ‘fire'.
   A patient may report a feeling of sadness, or may be unaware of it. A Full or
Empty quality on the Lung pulse is usually the most reliable indication of
whether sadness is involved in a presenting condition. I find that a Full Lung
pulse often indicates sadness which has been held on to for a long time by the
patient, who may be totally unaware of its presence. When the Lung pulse is
Weak or Empty, I find the patient more likely to report feeling sad.
   Sadness depletes Lung- and Heart-Qi; however, with time, the deficiency of
Qi in the chest may also give rise to some stagnation of Qi in the chest. This
stagnation is associated with the Lungs and Heart and not the Liver. It manifests
with a slight feeling of tightness of the chest, experiencing the sadness in the
chest, sighing and slight palpitations.
   The most likely Empty pa erns giving rise to sadness are a deficiency of
Lung-Qi and Heart-Qi, Liver-Blood or Heart-Blood. When sadness is due to an
Empty condition it is often accompanied by frequent crying. Sadness from Liver-
Blood deficiency is more common in women and becomes worse after the period
or after childbirth. Sadness with a feeling of lump in the throat may be due to
Lung-Qi stagnation.
   Grief is akin to sadness and usually derives from loss, separation or
bereavement. Like sadness, it depletes Lung- and Heart-Qi but, with time, it may
also give rise to some stagnation of Qi in the chest causing similar symptoms to
the ones mentioned above for sadness.
   Case history 44.2 illustrates a pa ern of grief underlying chest pain.

              Case History 44.2
         A 57-year-old woman presented with the main complaint of
      pain in the chest. As she was speaking, I observed that her eyes
      were quite lustreless and lacking in shen . This always points to an
      emotional origin of the problem. I asked her how long she had
      had the chest pain and she replied that it had started after her
      husband's death a few years before.
         Her tongue was Swollen with a red tip and her pulse was
      slightly Slippery but very slightly Tight on the Lung position.
         Diagnosis:
         This is a very good example of the eﬀect of grief. The grief
      from her husband's death had caused initially a deficiency of the
      Heart and Lungs; with time, this had caused some stagnation of
      Qi in these two organs. The stagnation of Heart-Qi manifested
      with a red tip of the tongue while the stagnation of Qi in both
      Heart and Lungs caused the chest pain. As this condition was
      long-standing, the depletion and simultaneous stagnation of
      Lung-Qi had disrupted the movement and transformation of Qi
      and fluids, giving rise to some Phlegm in the chest which
      contributed to the chest pain. The Phlegm was indicated by the
      swelling of the tongue and the Slippery pulse.
         This patient had an interesting emotional reaction to the
      treatment which is worth reporting. I used a simple treatment
      needling PE-6 Neiguan on one side, LU-7 Lieque on the other,
      Ren-12 Zhongwan and ST-40 Fenglong. A few days after the
      treatment she went to the graveyard to visit her husband's grave
      for the first time since his death and she cried. She had obviously
      repressed her grief for many years and this had caused the
      stagnation of Qi of the Heart and Lungs in the chest. Another
      emotional reaction a few days after the treatment was that for the
      first time she experienced anger at work. This is also interesting
      as, just as there is a controlling relationship between Wood and
      Metal, there is one between their allied emotions (i.e. anger and
      sadness/grief). Obviously the release of Qi stagnation in Metal
      had stopped excessive control of Metal over Wood and led to an
      explosion of anger. Moreover, each emotion can counteract
      another across the reverse Controlling (Ke ) cycle of the Five
      Elements; that is, anger (Wood) counteracts sadness (Metal), joy
      (Fire) counteracts fear (Water), pensiveness (Earth) counteracts
      anger (Wood), etc.
   Box 44.7 summarizes the pa erns underlying sadness and grief.

          BOX 44.7         SADNESS/GRIEF
         • Lung- and Heart-Qi deficiency: sadness, crying, depression,
      Pale tongue, Empty pulse
         • Liver-Blood deficiency: sadness, crying, worse after the
      period or childbirth (women), mental confusion, aimlessness, Pale
      tongue, Choppy or Fine pulse
         • Heart-Blood deficiency: sadness, crying, depression, Pale
      and Thin tongue, Choppy or Fine pulse
         • Lung-Qi stagnation: sadness with feeling of a lump in the
      throat, mild irritability, depression, tongue slightly Red on the
      sides in the chest areas, pulse very slightly Tight on the right Front
      position

    EXCESS JOY
   Of course, few patients will report feeling excessively joyful! A normal state
of joy is obviously not a cause of disease. Several emotional states are included
under the term of ‘excess joy'. First, it includes the sudden state of extreme
elation deriving from joyful news. This makes Qi rise and it expands the Heart.
Secondly, excess joy can be interpreted as a life characterized by excessive
excitement and stimulation. This also causes Qi to rise and may lead to Heart-
Fire. Thirdly, excess joy is seen in certain mental conditions such as hypomania
or manic behaviour.
   The negative eﬀect of excess joy can be easily observed in young children.
Every mother knows that a period of extreme playfulness, hyperactivity and
laughing is frequently followed by tears.
   A Full pa ern of the Heart is most likely to cause excess joy. Phlegm-Fire
harassing the Heart may cause the most severe cases of excess joy; that seen in
mental diseases such as bipolar disorder is a typical example of this. However,
Phlegm-Fire does not necessarily always cause severe symptoms. It may be seen
relatively frequently in milder forms when it causes excessive and inappropriate
laughter, bouts of excess joy and hyperactivity. Heart-Fire may also cause a
permanently elated mood.

         Phlegm-Fire harassing the Heart does not always manifest
      with severe mental symptoms.
   Empty-Heat of the Heart may also lead to excess joy and a feeling of being
driven and not being able to stop.
   Box 44.8 summarizes the pa erns underlying excess joy.

          BOX 44.8         EXCESS JOY
          • Phlegm-Fire harassing the Heart: excess joy, mental
      confusion, excessive and inappropriate laughter, mental
      restlessness, Red tongue with redder swollen tip, Heart crack with
      a sticky yellow coating inside it, Slippery-Rapid or Slippery-
      Overflowing-Rapid pulse
          • Heart-Fire: Excess joy, permanently elated mood, excessive
      laughter, mental restlessness, feeling of agitation, Red tongue with
      redder tip and yellow coating, Overflowing-Rapid pulse
          • Heart Empty-Heat: excess joy, permanently elated feeling as
      if being driven, anxiety, propensity to be startled, mental
      restlessness, uneasiness, ‘feeling hot and bothered', Red tongue,
      redder on the tip, no coating, Floating-Empty and Rapid pulse

     MENTAL RESTLESSNESS
   ‘Mental restlessness' is a translation of the term Fan Zao, which literally
means ‘vexation and restlessness'. It also includes restless legs. The term Fan Zao
encompasses two diﬀerent symptoms: Fan (vexation) is due to Full-Heat and
pertains to the Lungs, whereas Zao (restlessness) is due to Empty-Heat and
pertains to the Kidneys. Fan is Yang whereas Zao is Yin.
   A patient is unlikely to use the term ‘mental restlessness' but may describe
having ‘diﬃculty in concentration', ‘not being able to focus on one thing for any
length of time' or ‘not being able to sit still and do nothing'.
   Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat may cause a vague feeling of mental
restlessness which worsens in the evening. Phlegm-Heat in the Stomach or
Heart, or both, or Heart-Fire, will cause a more intense feeling which may be
accompanied by mental confusion. Mental restlessness may also be caused by
Lung-Heat, in which cause it will be accompanied by worry and other Lung
symptoms such as breathlessness or cough.
   Box 44.9 summarizes the pa erns underlying mental restlessness.

          BOX 44.9         MENTAL RESTLESSNESS
          • Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat: vague mental restlessness,
      restless legs, Red tongue without coating, Floating-Empty and
      Rapid pulse
          • Phlegm-Heat in the Stomach and Heart: mental restlessness,
      mental confusion, agitation, rash behaviour, tendency to hit or
  scold people, shouting, depression, manic behaviour, tongue Red
  in the centre with a sticky yellow coating and a Stomach/Heart
  crack with a rough, sticky yellow coating inside it, Slippery- Rapid
  pulse
     • Heart-Fire: pronounced mental restlessness, agitation, Red
  tongue with redder tip and yellow coating, Overflowing-Rapid

     INTRODUCTION
   An enquiry about the sexual life of the patient should always form part of the
interrogation. This is not one of the traditional 10 questions from Chinese books,
partly for cultural reasons. In fact, starting from the Ming period and especially
during the Qing dynasty, Chinese medicine was heavily influenced by the
prevalent Confucian morality, which condemned any talk or display of
sexuality.

     WHY WE ASK
   Questions about sexual symptoms are asked primarily to ascertain the state
of the Kidneys. In fact a Kidney deficiency is at the basis of many sexual
symptoms such as impotence, premature ejaculation or frigidity.
   In men, apart from asking about any sexual problems such as impotence, it is
important to establish whether any of their symptoms is aggravated by sexual
activity or if they feel excessively tired after sexual activity. An aggravation of a
symptom after sexual activity always indicates a Qi deficiency, often of the
Kidneys. A Kidney deficiency is indicated also if a man feels especially tired
after sexual activity and particularly if the tiredness is accompanied by dizziness,
backache, weak knees, etc.
   However, it should not be forgo en that other organs play a role in the origin
of sexual symptoms and particularly the Liver and the Heart. The Heart, in
particular, plays an important role in sexual desire and in the achievement of a
normal erection in men.

    WHEN WE ASK
   I generally ask about sexual symptoms when the patient presents with a clear
Kidney- or Heart-deficiency pa ern. I also ask about sexual symptoms when the
patient is clearly under emotional stress and I suspect that this may be due to
sexual problems such as impotence in men or failure to achieve an orgasm in
women.

    HOW WE ASK
   For obvious reasons, the practitioner needs to be particularly tactful when
asking about sexual symptoms, especially when the practitioner and patient are
of the opposite sex. In some cases, when I feel instinctively that the patient
would not appreciate such questions, I do not ask them.
   An enquiry about sexual activity in men is important not only for diagnostic
reasons but also to be able to advise them about appropriate levels of sexual
activities according to Chinese medicine. 1 There are significant diﬀerences
between the sexual physiology of men and of women that are not often taken
into account when advising patients about the desirable frequency of sexual
activity: the Chinese caution about ‘excessive sexual activity' is more relevant to
men than to women. In fact, the Tian Gui , a direct manifestation of Essence (Jing
), is sperm in men and menstrual blood in women: quite simply, because men
lose sperm but women do not obviously lose menstrual blood during
intercourse, sexual activity may potentially be weakening for men (when it is too
frequent) but not so much for women.

    MEN
   The sexual symptoms discussed are:

         • Impotence
         • Lack of libido
         • Premature ejaculation
         • Nocturnal emissions
         • Tiredness and dizziness after ejaculation
   (The symptoms and signs related to men's sexual system are in Chapter 75 of
Part 5 .)

     Impotence
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 75
   Impotence is by far the most common sexual complaint in men and the first
cause that would come to mind would be a Kidney deficiency and especially a
Kidney-Yang deficiency. This is a common cause of impotence, especially in
older men, in which case it is accompanied by a feeling of cold, backache, weak
knees, dizziness, tinnitus and poor memory, and abundant and clear urine.
   In young men, however, it is my experience that impotence is more often
related to a Heart pa ern, such as Heart-Blood deficiency or Heart-Fire, and
anxiety. In a few cases, impotence may also be caused by Damp-Heat in the
Liver channel.

            Impotence in young men is caused more frequently by a Heart
       pa ern than by a Kidney deficiency.
   Box 45.1 summarizes pa erns underlying male impotence.

            BOX 45.1         IMPOTENCE
            • Kidney (especially Kidney-Yang) deficiency: impotence,
       feeling of cold, backache, abundant clear urine, weak knees,
       dizziness, tinnitus, poor memory
            • Heart-Blood deficiency: impotence, dizziness, palpitations,
       Choppy pulse
            • Heart-Fire: impotence, palpitations, insomnia, dream-
       disturbed sleep, Rapid-Overflowing pulse
            • Damp-Heat in the Liver channel: impotence, heaviness of the
       scrotum, urethral discharge, sticky yellow coating

     Lack Of Libido
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 75
   Lack of libido in men is usually related to a deficiency of Qi or Yang, most
frequently of the Kidneys; however, other organs may be relevant and a severe
Qi deficiency of such organs as Spleen, Heart or Lungs may also cause lack of
libido. In my experience, a deficiency of the Heart is a more common cause of
lack of libido than deficiency of the Kidneys. Among Full conditions, Liver-Qi
stagnation may also cause lack of libido. Dampness in the Lower Burner may
also cause lack of libido.

    Nocturnal Emissions
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 75
   ‘Nocturnal emissions' indicates ejaculation during sleep; this symptom
always has ‘pride of place' among Kidney-deficiency symptoms in Chinese
books. In the West, this symptom is relatively rare and it is not even considered a
‘symptom' unless it occurs very frequently (e.g. once a week or more).
   There are cultural reasons why this symptom always has a prominent place
among Kidney-deficiency symptoms in Chinese books. In ancient times
ejaculation during sleep, especially if with sexual dreams, was considered to be
due to the man having intercourse with female ghosts at night; such ghosts were
considered very dangerous because they robbed men of their vital Essence.
   In general, nocturnal emissions without sexual dreams are due purely to a
deficiency (usually of the Kidneys), while nocturnal emissions with sexual
dreams are usually due to Heat (which may be Full or Empty). Thus, Empty-
Heat arising from a Kidney deficiency may cause nocturnal emissions with
dreams; Full-Heat, particularly of the Liver or Heart, or both, may also cause this
symptom.

         Nocturnal emissions without dreams are due to a Kidney-Yin
      deficiency whereas nocturnal emissions with dreams are due to
      Heat (Full or Empty).
    Tiredness And Dizziness After Ejaculation
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 75
   A pronounced feeling of tiredness and dizziness after ejaculation is nearly
always due to a deficiency of the Kidneys.

    WOMEN
   The sexual symptoms discussed are as follows:

          • lack of libido
          • headache soon after orgasm.

    Lack Of Libido
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 89
   Lack of libido or an inability to reach an orgasm in women is usually related
to a Kidney or Heart deficiency.
   Generally, sexual desire depends on the state of Kidney-Yang and the
Minister Fire: a deficient Minister Fire may cause a lack of sexual desire (and
conversely, Fire of the Liver or Heart, or both, and Empty-Heat deriving from
Kidney-Yin deficiency may cause an excessive sexual desire).
   The Heart plays an important role in sexual arousal and orgasm in women.
During sexual arousal, there is an arousal of the (physiological) Minister Fire of
the Kidneys, which goes up towards the Heart and Pericardium; it is this
upward flow of the Minister Fire towards the Heart that causes a flushed face
and an increased heart rate. Thus, a lack of sexual desire is often due to a
deficient Minister Fire and therefore Kidney-Yang.
   During orgasm, the Minister Fire that was rising during sexual arousal is
suddenly discharged downwards; this downward movement of the Minister Fire
is controlled by the Heart (whose Qi naturally descends). Hence an inability to
reach an orgasm may be due to a Heart deficiency.
   Of course, a woman's inability to reach an orgasm depends also on the man's
performance during the sexual act. According to Daoist sexual alchemy, men
pertain to Fire and Fire flares up easily and is easily extinguished; women
pertain to Water and Water is ‘slow to boil and slow to cool down'. It is for this
reason that the ancient Daoist sex manuals were aimed primarily at men so that
they would be skilled in the art of sexual foreplay. Therefore, when considering
a woman's inability to reach an orgasm we should keep in mind the possibility
that this is due to her partner's lack of skill rather than her own deficiency
pa ern.

    Headache Soon After Orgasm
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 89
   A headache soon after orgasm usually indicates rebellious Qi of the
Penetrating Vessel. It may also indicate Heart-Fire.

    INTRODUCTION

    WHY WE ASK
   In women patients, an enquiry about gynaecological symptoms is absolutely essential,
as such questions are often crucial to reach a diagnosis in women, even for non-
gynaecological problems. For example, if a woman suﬀers from lower abdominal pain and
we are uncertain as to the cause, if her periods are painful and the menstrual blood is dark
and with clots this indicates conclusively that the abdominal pain is due to Blood stasis.

     WHEN WE ASK
   Unless a woman presents specifically with a gynaecological complaint, I generally ask
about her gynaecological history towards the end of the consultation. An enquiry into the
gynaecological history even in postmenopausal women gives us an idea of the general
condition of Qi and Blood. For example, a woman may have suﬀered throughout her life
from heavy periods that were caused by Blood-Heat; if she comes to us after the
menopause and we suspect that she might suﬀer from Blood-Heat but we are uncertain
because the symptoms are quite mild, an enquiry into her menstrual history would help to
confirm this diagnosis.

     HOW WE ASK
   When asking about a woman's gynaecological history, we should always start from the
beginning by enquiring about the conditions of her cycle 2 years after menarche (because
it is common for the cycle to be irregular for the first 2 years before it se les down).
   We should ask systematically first about the actual menstrual cycle and, secondly,
about all other events in a woman's gynaecological history.
   Regarding the menstrual cycle, we should ask about: the age of menarche, the cycle,
the amount of bleeding, the colour of menstrual blood, and whether there are clots, pain,
and any premenstrual symptoms.
   With regard to other gynaecological events, we should ask specifically about:
childbirth, abortion, miscarriage, use of contraceptives (the Pill, uterine coil), or of
hormone replacement therapy, the presence of pelvic inflammatory disease, whether there
have been any gynaecological surgical interventions (such as dilatation and cure age,
laser treatment, hysteroscopy, colposcopy, laparoscopy, etc.).

     THE GYNAECOLOGICAL HISTORY
   Women's gynaecological history may sometimes be complicated; for example, a
woman may have used the contraceptive pill or the coil for some years, or she may have
had two children with possibly one or more miscarriages or terminations in between. In
such cases, it is useful to draw a diagram illustrating clearly the ages at which such events
occurred. As an illustration, Figure 46.1 shows the gynaecological history of a woman
whose menarche occurred at 14 and who had an abortion at 18, a child at 24 and 28, an
ovarian cyst at 36 and the menopause at 52.

   If the woman's cycle is irregular and characterized by discharges or mid-cycle pain or
discharge, it is also useful to draw a diagram illustrating clearly at what part of the cycle
such events take place. As a way of illustration, Figure 46.2 shows the menstrual cycle of a
woman whose period lasts 7 days and who experiences mid-cycle pain and premenstrual
tension with breast distension.

      FIG. 46.2   Diagram of menstrual cycle
   Some women may complain of prolonged menstrual bleeding whereas, in fact, they
may suﬀer from mid-cycle bleeding. Case history 46.1 illustrates this.

                  Case History 46.1
          A 42-year-old woman complained of ‘almost constant menstrual
      bleeding'. She said that her period would last for 3 weeks and she would
      then have a week without bleeding before the next period began. However,
      on closer interrogation it emerged that what she described as ‘bleeding' was
      in fact a dark vaginal discharge. The diagnostic interpretation and
      treatment were therefore obviously diﬀerent from what would be
      suggested by prolonged bleeding.

     Gynaecological events affecting diagnosis
   Some gynaecological events (e.g. colposcopy) have a certain eﬀect on the woman's
physiology which we need to take into account when diagnosing; others make diagnosing
practically impossible, (e.g. the Pill).
   The answers to questions regarding regularity of cycle, amount of bleeding, colour of
menstrual blood, pain, etc., are unreliable if the woman is on the Pill or has an intrauterine
device. The Pill regularizes the periods, makes them usually scanty and less painful, and
often prevents clo ing; the intrauterine device generally makes the periods heavier and
more painful. In such cases, it is important to ask the patient what her menstrual cycle was
like before she began using these forms of contraception.

     BREAST SYMPTOMS
   The breasts in women are influenced primarily by the Stomach channel, which controls
the main tissues of the breast and the lactiferous ducts; the Liver channel influences the
nipple but also, together with the Gall-Bladder channel, the lateral side of the breast. The
Penetrating Vessel also influences the lactiferous ducts and the connective tissues of the
breast, which, in Chinese medicine, would be classified as ‘Membranes' (Huang ). The
Muscle channels of the Gall-Bladder, Heart and Pericardium flow over the breast. (See Fig.
46.3 and also Fig. 12.1 on p. 121 illustrating the channels coursing through the breast.)

      FIG. 46.3   Organs influencing areas of the breast
   The Penetrating Vessel originates from the Uterus and connects with the breasts and
this relationship can be seen in the linkage that exists between menstrual blood and breast
milk: breast milk is a transformation of menstrual blood that occurs after childbirth and
the Penetrating Vessel, being the Sea of Blood, is therefore, after childbirth, the source of
breast milk. Many breast pathologies, including breast lumps, especially in women over
the age of 40, nearly always occur against a background of ‘disharmony' of the Penetrating
Vessel, which means either a deficiency or stasis of Blood in this vessel.

    Breast Lumps
   Observation , Chapter 12 ; Palpation , Chapter 51 ; Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 88
   A common pathology of the breasts in women is the development of lumps.
   Relatively soft, movable, painless, multiple lumps with distinct edges usually indicate
fibrocystic disease, which, from the Chinese point of view, is due to Phlegm.
   A single, movable, relatively hard lump with distinct edges usually indicates a
fibroadenoma, which, from the Chinese point of view, is due to a combination of Phlegm
and Blood stasis.
   A single, painless, immovable lump with indistinct edges may indicate carcinoma of
the breast which, from the Chinese point of view, is usually due to a combination of
Phlegm, Qi stagnation and Blood stasis.
   The age of the patient may give a rough indication of which is the most likely of these
three pathologies because fibroadenomas are more common between the ages of 20 and
30, cysts between 30 and 50 and carcinoma from 50 onwards; of course, these are only
general statistical indications which always have exceptions in practice.

    Premenstrual Breast Distension
   Observation , Chapter 12 ; Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 88
   One of the most common presenting breast symptoms is premenstrual breast
distension, which is a very typical sign of Liver-Qi stagnation. Although Liver-Qi
stagnation aﬀecting the breasts is a very common condition, stagnation of Lung-Qi also
has an important influence on the breasts in women. Emotional problems such as sadness,
grief and worry aﬀect the Lungs and may impair the circulation of Qi in the chest and
therefore in the breasts as well. For this reason, many breast pathologies in women,
including breast lumps, may be due to stagnation of Lung-Qi rather than Liver-Qi and to
the above-mentioned emotions rather than anger or repressed anger. In particular, some
modern Chinese doctors relate breast pathologies to the emotional stress deriving from
separation such as widowhood, breaking up of relationships, divorce, death of one's
children or bereavement at a young age from the death of one's spouse. Liver-Qi
stagnation is accompanied by irritability and a Wiry pulse, whereas in Lung-Qi stagnation
there is sadness and a Weak pulse.
   If the breasts become also swollen, uncomfortable and noticeably larger before the
period, this also indicates also Liver-Qi stagnation but combined with Phlegm, in which
case the tongue is swollen. If the breasts are distended and noticeably painful before the
periods, with a Purple tongue, this indicates Liver-Blood stasis. A slight feeling of
distension of the breasts after the periods, with a Choppy pulse, is usually due to Liver-
Blood deficiency.
   Case history 46.2 illustrates a pa ern underlying breast distension.

                 Case History 46.2
         A 36-year-old woman had been suﬀering from premenstrual swelling
      and pain of both breasts, but worse on the left, with a lump on the edge of
      the left breast which came up before the period and disappeared
      afterwards. She had been suﬀering from this problem for approximately 8
      years. She suﬀered no other menstrual irregularity as her periods came
      regularly and were not too heavy or scanty and not painful.
         On interrogation, it transpired that she also suﬀered from tiredness,
      floaters, weakness, dizziness, palpitations, loose stools and anxiety in the
      evening.
         Her tongue was slightly Pale and Swollen on the sides and had a sticky
      coating. Her pulse was Fine and slightly Wiry.
          Diagnosis:
          The breast pathology itself shows a clear condition of Liver-Qi
      stagnation because the swelling of the breast is clearly premenstrual;
      however, the breast lump, the pronounced swelling and the pain indicate
      that there is also Phlegm. This is Qi-Phlegm and the lump comes and goes
      because of the Qi stagnation. Liver-Qi stagnation occurs against a
      background       of   Liver-Blood   deficiency   of   which   there   are   clear
      manifestations (tiredness, floaters, dizziness, Pale sides of the tongue, Fine
      pulse). There is also some Heart-Blood deficiency indicated by the
      palpitations and the anxiety in the evening. Finally, there is an underlying
      Spleen-Qi deficiency indicated by the weakness and the loose stools; the
      Spleen-Qi deficiency has given rise to Phlegm.

      tongue
          • Liver-Blood stasis: painful breasts, Purple tongue
          • Liver-Blood deficiency: mild breast distension, Choppy pulse

     MENSTRUATION
   When asking about menstruation, we should ask about the following aspects
systematically:

          • amount of bleeding
          • colour
          • consistency
          • cycle
          • menarche
          • menopause
          • pain
          • premenstrual symptoms
          • other symptoms occurring around menstruation.
   When asking questions about the menstrual cycle, I always ask the woman how her
periods were about 2 years after the menarche (remember that it is normal for the period
to be somewhat irregular for 2 years after menarche). This is important because it gives us
an idea of the woman's constitutional menstrual cycle, eliminating the influence of
subsequent gynaecological events (e.g. pregnancy, childbirth, miscarriage, abortion,
contraception, etc).
   For example, a woman may have suﬀered heavy blood loss during childbirth and
therefore develop a Blood deficiency which makes her periods scanty. The scanty period
in this case shows not her constitutional menstrual cycle but the consequence of a definite
cause of disease. By asking her about her menstruation 2 years after menarche, we
formulate an idea of the constitutional state of her gynaecological system.

    Amount Of Bleeding
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 84
   The loss of blood during menstruation can vary between 30 and 80 ml. A period is
defined as ‘heavy' if the loss of blood is either profuse or prolonged. It is important to ask
how many days the period lasts because a period that lasts more than 5 days is normally
considered excessive in Chinese medicine, while one that lasts under 4 days is normally
considered scanty. While most women would describe as abnormal a period that either
lasts too long or is too heavy, they would not use the same term for a period that is too
short or too scanty. In other words, many women would say that their period is ‘normal'
when it lasts 3 days or even less or when the bleeding is very light.
   A heavy loss of blood is due to Qi deficiency, Blood-Heat, Blood Empty-Heat, Liver-
and Kidney-Yin deficiency or Blood stasis. If the period is scanty, this denotes Blood
deficiency. Cold in the Uterus or Liver-Blood stasis.

         In my experience, there is strong bias among practitioners to a ribute
      heavy periods always to Qi deficiency. This is not so and, in my experience,
      about half the cases are due to Blood-Heat and half to Qi deficiency.
   Case history 46.3 illustrates a pa ern underlying heavy periods.

               Case History 46.3
         A 42-year-old woman had been suﬀering from heavy periods for 15
      years: the periods came regularly, they lasted 7 days, they were not painful
      and the menstrual blood was dark with clots. The heaviest flow was in the
      first 3 days of the period. A month before her consultation a scan revealed
      the presence of fibroids in the uterus.
         Her body build was robust, her eyes had good lustre indicating good
      Spirit and her general energy was good. She was rather overweight and her
      complexion was sallow. She had no other symptoms, apart from
      occasionally mucus in the stools. Questions investigating a possible Kidney
      deficiency revealed no symptoms of it. On palpation, her abdomen felt
      quite soft and the fibroids could not be palpated. Her tongue had a normal
      colour but was very Swollen. Her pulse was Slippery, Full and slightly
      Overflowing.
          Diagnosis:
         Her body build, the good Spirit and general energy indicate a good
      constitution, although being overweight indicates Phlegm. The presence of
      Phlegm is confirmed by the presence of occasional mucus in the stools, her
      being overweight, the swelling of the tongue and the Slippery pulse; the
      fibroids could also be partly due to Phlegm. The dark menstrual blood with
      clots and the presence of the fibroids themselves indicates Blood stasis
      localized in the Uterus and not severe enough to turn the tongue Purple. In
      this case, we can therefore conclude that the fibroids are due to a
      combination of both Phlegm and Blood stasis; the softness of her abdomen
      on palpation indicates that Phlegm is the predominant pathogenic factor in
      the formation of the fibroids.
         The two major causes of heavy menstrual flow are usually Qi deficiency
      or Blood-Heat and in this case it is due to Blood-Heat; there are not many
      signs of this because the tongue is not Red, but it is shown primarily by the
      Overflowing pulse. On the other hand, there are no signs of a Spleen or
      Kidney deficiency even though the Spleen must be deficient for Phlegm to
      form. In her case, there are probably not many symptoms of deficiency
      because of her good constitution, which is also shown by the Full pulse;
      this, while it does indicate the presence of pathogenic factor also indicates
      that the Upright Qi has not been severely aﬀected.
         In this case, it is necessary to treat her three main conditions (i.e.
      Phlegm, Blood-Heat and Blood stasis) simultaneously and the treatment
      principle is therefore to resolve Phlegm, cool and invigorate Blood and stop
      bleeding.

    Colour
   Observation , Chapter 20 ; Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 84
   The colour of the menstrual blood varies slightly during the period. In general, it is
usually dark red, being lighter at the beginning, deep red in the middle, and pinkish at the
end of the period. Box 46.4 summarizes the main areas of questioning and pa erns with
regard to colour.

          BOX 46.4        COLOUR OF MENSTRUAL BLOOD
         • Blood-Heat: dark red or bright red
         • Blood deficiency: pale
         • Stasis of Blood: blackish, very dark
         • Full-Cold: purplish
         • Empty-Cold: brownish like soya-bean sauce and dilute
         • Empty-Heat in Blood: scarlet red

    Consistency
   Observation , Chapter 20 ; Symptoms and Signs , Chapter 84
   The normal flow does not coagulate and there are no clots; the blood is neither dilute
nor thick. Box 46.5 summarizes the main areas of questioning and pa erns with regard to
the consistency of menstrual blood.

          BOX 46.5         CONSISTENCY OF MENSTRUAL
      BLOOD
          • Stasis of Blood or Cold in the Uterus: clo ed, with dark, dull clots
          • Heat: clo ed, with dark but fresh-looking clots
          • Stasis of Blood: large clots
          • Cold in the Uterus: small dark clots, but blood not dark
          • Blood or Yin deficiency: watery
          • Dampness or Damp-Heat in the Uterus: sticky

     Cycle
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 84
   The length of the cycle is ideally 28 days, but it may vary from this norm. The
regularity of the cycle is somewhat more important than its absolute value; thus, if the
cycle is consistently of 32 days, this can be deemed normal and would not be considered
as ‘late periods'. Moreover, an occasional deviation from a regular cycle should not be
considered abnormal as the menstrual cycle is influenced by many factors such as
travelling, emotional stress, etc.
   There are several main areas of questioning with regard to the cycle. Periods that are
always early (i.e. more than 7 days early) may be due to Qi deficiency, Blood-Heat or
Empty-Heat in the Blood from Blood or Yin deficiency. Periods that are always late (i.e.
more than 7 days late) may be due to Blood deficiency, stasis of Blood or stasis of Cold.
Periods that are irregular (sometimes late, sometimes early) may be due to stagnation of
Liver-Qi, stasis of Liver-Blood, Spleen deficiency or Kidney deficiency. Periods that stop
and start, or that start or end with a brownish discharge, may be due to Liver-Blood stasis.
If there is mid-cycle bleeding then this may be due to Damp-Heat, especially if there is
also some pain, Qi deficiency, or Liver- and Kidney-Yin deficiency.
   Amenorrhoea may be due to severe Blood deficiency (as often happens in women
athletes), Blood stasis or Cold in the Uterus.
   Box 46.6 summarizes the pa erns underlying menstrual cycle irregularites.

          BOX 46.6         CYCLE IRREGULARITIES
          • Always early: Qi deficiency, Blood-Heat, Blood Empty-Heat, Liver-
      and Kidney-Yin deficiency
          • Always late: Blood deficiency, Liver-Blood stasis, Cold in the Uterus
          • Irregular: Liver-Qi stagnation, Liver-Blood stasis, Spleen deficiency,
      Kidney deficiency
          • Hesitant start: Liver-Blood stasis
          • Starting or ending with brownish discharge: Liver-Blood stasis
          • Mid-cycle bleeding: Damp-Heat, Qi deficiency, Liver- and Kidney-Yin
      deficiency
          • Amenorrhoea: severe Blood deficiency, Blood stasis, Cold in the
      Uterus
     Menarche
   The age of menarche ranges between 10 and 16, with a mean at 12.8. Menarche tends to
occur at a younger age in industrialized countries compared with developing, agricultural
societies.
   Early menarche (i.e. before about 13) may indicate Blood-Heat, whereas late menarche
(after about 16) may indicate Blood or Kidney deficiency, or both, or Cold in the Uterus.

     Menopause
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 89
   By menopause is meant the period of time during which levels of oestrogen decline
sharply, menstruation stops and a woman becomes infertile. From the Chinese point of
view, the menopause is due to a natural, physiological decline of Kidney-Essence and it is
therefore not a gynaecological ‘disease'. It requires therapeutic intervention only when the
manifestations of this transitional period become uncomfortable or distressing.

             The menopause is not a ‘disease'.
   The main manifestations which usually bring a woman to seek treatment are hot
flushes, sweating and vaginal dryness. Strictly speaking, these three are the only
symptoms which are directly related to a decline of hormone levels. However, many other
symptoms may appear owing to the decline of Kidney-Essence and other allied pa erns.
These may be headaches, depression, anxiety, irritability, crying, poor memory,
clumsiness, insomnia, tiredness, dry skin and hair.
   It is a common misconception that menopausal symptoms are always due to Kidney-
Yin deficiency because they are characterized by hot flushes. Although the hot flushes will
obviously be more intense if there is a Kidney-Yin deficiency, they also occur in woman
suﬀering from Kidney-Yang deficiency because, especially during the menopausal years, a
Kidney deficiency nearly always includes a deficiency of both Yin and Yang. This very
frequently gives rise to contradictory hot and cold symptoms. For example, a menopausal
woman suﬀering from Kidney-Yin deficiency may experience severe hot flushes, night
sweating, dryness of the vagina and skin, but she may also suﬀer from cold feet. Vice
versa, a menopausal woman suﬀering from Kidney-Yang deficiency may experience cold
feet and a cold feeling in general, frequent urination but also hot flushes.
   There are two other pa erns associated with a Kidney deficiency in the menopausal
years which are particularly common; these are Liver-Yang rising (causing headaches) and
Heart-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat (causing insomnia, anxiety, agitation and poor
memory).
   Finally, menopausal symptoms may be aggravated by pre-existing pa erns, the main
one being Phlegm. This may aggravate the hot flushes and also worsen the mental-
emotional symptoms associated with the menopause.

             Menopausal symptoms occur against a background of Kidney-Yang as
      often as Kidney-Yin deficiency.

     Pain
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 84
   Apart from a slight discomfort, normally the menstrual period should be almost
painless. The main areas of questioning with regard to menstrual pain are as follows.

    Time of pain
   Pain before the period may be caused by stagnation of Qi or stasis of Blood; the la er is
typically relieved by the onset of the period. Pain during the period is generally due to
Blood-Heat or Blood stasis. If there is pain after the period then this may be a result of
Blood deficiency.

    Nature of pain
   Severe, stabbing pain indicates a stasis of Blood. Severe, cramping pain, which is eased
by application of heat such as a hot-water bo le, is caused by stasis of Cold.
   A mild pain can indicate either Blood-Heat or deficiency of Blood; a dragging feeling
in the lower abdomen accompanying mild pain is due to sinking of Qi. A feeling of
heaviness in the lower abdomen with pain, or pain on ovulation, may be caused by Damp-
Heat.
   Case histories 46.4 -46.6 illustrate some pa erns underlying menstrual pain.

                Case History 46.4
           A 15-year-old girl had been suﬀering from severe abdominal pain for
        just over a year, beginning 18 months after menarche. The pain was on the
        right side of her abdomen and she described it as a continuous, dull ache.
        However, it would become sharp and stabbing in nature during her period
        and also at other times. The pain was relieved by the application of heat.
           Three months before she came for treatment, the patient had had an
        ovarian cyst removed from her left side and one on her right side had been
        drained. She had also had recurrent a acks of oral and genital ulcers since
        the age of 9. These had been relieved by treatment with steroids. On
        questioning, the patient revealed that she was prone to constipation,
        specifically that she had infrequent bowel actions.
           Her tongue body was Swollen and slightly Red on the sides. It had a
        white-sticky coating, particularly in the Gall-Bladder area, and was peeled
        in the centre. Her pulse was Wiry on the right and slightly Wiry on the left,
        where it was also Empty at the Deep level.
           Diagnosis:
           The stabbing nature of the abdominal pain, together with its alleviation
        by the application of heat, seems to suggest Cold in the Uterus as the main
        cause. The abdominal pain began shortly after menarche, which also would
        suggest the presence of Cold in the Uterus as this is a very common
        pathogenic factor in young girls suﬀering from dysmenorrhoea. The Wiry
        quality of the pulse seems also to confirm the presence of stagnation.
        However, this initial hypothesis is not confirmed by the other clinical
        manifestations.
           Ovarian cysts are usually characterized by Dampness, which is the case
        in this patient, as the presence of Dampness is confirmed by the swelling of
        the tongue and the sticky coating.
           The recurrent oral and genital ulcers are caused by Damp-Heat in the
        Girdle and Directing Vessels. A disharmony of the Girdle Vessel is a
frequent cause of the accumulation of Dampness in the genital system,
especially in women: a disharmony of this Vessel is confirmed by the
distribution of the tongue coating in the Gall-Bladder areas (Fig. 46.4 ) This
disharmony of the Directing Vessel is shown clearly by the distribution of
oral and genital ulcers as this vessel starts from Ren-1, flows through the
external genitalia and, on the face, it wraps around the mouth. In this case,
Dampness is combined with Heat, which is evident from the redness of the
sides of the tongue.

      FIG. 46.4   Patient's tongue
   Therefore, we can conclude that the abdominal pain is caused by Damp-
Heat and not by Cold as it would appear on first impression. The long-
standing retention of Dampness in the Lower Burner (it started when she
was aged 9) also led to Qi and Blood stasis and therefore the aggravation of
the pain during the period. From a Western medicine point of view,
recurrent oral and genital ulcers, which are inflammatory and non-
infectious, are known as Behçet's disease.
   The peeling of the central area of the tongue indicates Stomach-Yin
deficiency, which was probably caused by Heat injuring Yin. The pulse
being Empty at the Deep level confirms the Yin deficiency; however, it is
Empty on the left side (rather than the right side as it would be expected in
Stomach-Yin deficiency) and this may be due to a deficiency of Liver-Yin.
This is all the more likely owing to the disharmony of the Girdle Vessel,
which aﬀects the Gall-Bladder and Liver channels.

         Case History 46.5
   A 49-year-old woman had been suﬀering from menstrual flooding for 11
years. Since the birth of her second child, when she was 35, her cycle had
been irregular, varying in length between 17 and 45 days; the period lasted
7 days in total, was painful, the menstrual blood had clots and she had a
brown discharge for 1 day after the period. Her periods had been painful
also in the years following the menarche at 12. Her gynaecological history
was rather complicated as she had been on the contraceptive pill from the
age of 18 to 30, she had a miscarriage at 30, the first child at 31, another
miscarriage at 34, a second child at 35 and the periods became very heavy at
38. In complicated histories such as these it is helpful to draw two
diagrams, one outlining the main gynaecological events of her life and the
other depicting the menstrual cycle (Figs 46.5 and 46.6 ).

      FIG. 46.6 Diagram of menstrual cycle
   Apart from the gynaecological problem, she has also had diﬃculty in
controlling her bladder and also her bowel since the second pregnancy.
   Her pulse was slightly Overflowing and Rapid and very Weak on both
Rear positions; her tongue was Red and slightly Purple.
   Diagnosis:
   The menstrual flooding is caused by Blood-Heat, which is evidenced by
the Red tongue and Overflowing-Rapid pulse. There is also some Blood
stasis indicated by the painful period, menstrual clots, irregular cycle and
slightly Purple tongue. There is, thirdly, an underlying Kidney deficiency,
which is indicated by the weakness of the pulse in both Rear positions and
by the fact that the menstrual flooding started after the second childbirth
and that she had two miscarriages.
   The treatment principle is therefore to cool Blood, stop bleeding,
invigorate Blood and tonify the Kidneys. In gynaecological problems, it is
often appropriate to apply diﬀerent treatment principles in each phase of
the menstrual cycle. There are four phases in the menstrual cycle, the first
being the period itself during which Blood is moving, the second being the
postmenstrual phase during which there is a relative Blood deficiency, the
third being ovulation during which the Penetrating and Directing Vessels
are active and the fourth being the premenstrual phase during which Liver-
Qi moves. In this case, we can therefore cool and invigorate Blood during
the premenstrual phase and the period itself and tonify the Kidneys after
the period for about 2 weeks.

         Case History 46.6
   A 28-year-old woman had been suﬀering from painful periods ever
since the menarche. The periods came regularly and lasted 9 to 10 days; the
menstrual blood was dark with occasional clots. The pain was stabbing in
nature at times but at other times it was a dull, deep ache rather than a pain
and with a pronounced feeling of heaviness: she said ‘my whole lower body
feels thick, heavy and stodgy', which was clearly her way of expressing
what, in Chinese medicine, is called ‘a feeling of heaviness'. The pain was
situated in the central-lower abdominal area and was alleviated by a hot
bath. Recently, she had been experiencing pain on intercourse which was
sharp in nature and also located in the central-lower abdominal area. Apart
from painful periods, she had also been experiencing a dull, mid-cycle ache
on the right-lower abdominal area for the past 2 years; this ache was also
accompanied by a dark-brown discharge. She also suﬀered from
premenstrual tension, manifesting with irritability and distension of the
  breasts and abdomen. On the basis of an internal examination and an
  ultrasound scan, she had been diagnosed as suﬀering from endometriosis.
     Other symptoms elicited from interrogation included cold limbs,
  occasionally a feeling of heat in the face, palpitations, anxiety and tightness
  of the chest.
     The tongue was Red on the tip and the pulse was slightly Slippery in
  general and slightly Tight on the left rear position.
      Diagnosis:
     The stabbing character of the pain and the dark colour of the menstrual
  blood with clots clearly indicates Blood stasis which most probably derives
  from Cold in the Uterus. We can deduce the presence of Cold in the Uterus
  from the alleviation of the pain by a hot bath and also by the history: in fact,
  if the periods are painful from the time of menarche, the most common
  aetiological factor is invasion of the Uterus by external Cold owing to
  playing games wearing shorts in cold and damp weather. In this case,
  therefore, Cold in the Uterus obstructs the circulation of blood and causes
  Blood stasis.
     In addition to Blood stasis, there is also a clear pa ern of Dampness in
  the Lower Burner, which is manifested by the occasional dull ache during
  the periods, the pronounced feeling of heaviness and the mid-cycle pain.
  There is also some Liver-Qi stagnation causing the premenstrual symptoms.
     An occasional feeling of heat in the face, cold limbs, palpitations, anxiety
  and tightness of the chest can all be explained as manifestations of
  rebellious Qi in the Penetrating Vessel. In fact, given these symptoms and
  the menstrual symptoms, we can say that all her symptoms reflect a
  disharmony of the Penetrating Vessel.
     The main treatment principle is therefore simply to regulate the
  Penetrating Vessel by warming the Uterus, invigorating Blood and
  resolving Dampness from the Lower Burner.
Box 46.7 summarizes the pa erns underlying menstrual pain.

      BOX 46.7        MENSTRUAL PAIN
      Time of pain
     • Pain before the period: stagnation of Qi or stasis of Blood (the la er is
  typically relieved by the onset of the period)
     • Pain during the period: Blood-Heat or Blood stasis
     • Pain after the period: Blood deficiency
      Nature of pain
     • Severe, stabbing pain: stasis of Blood
     • Severe, cramping pain, eased by application of heat (such as a hot-
  water bo le): stasis of Cold
     • Mild pain: Blood-Heat or deficiency of Blood
     • Dragging feeling in the lower abdomen with mild pain: sinking of Qi
     • Feeling of heaviness in the lower abdomen with pain: Damp-Heat
     • Pain on ovulation: Damp-Heat

 Premenstrual Symptoms
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 85
   The most common cause of premenstrual tension is Liver-Qi stagnation which
manifests with irritability, depression and moodiness, a tendency to crying, impatience
and a Wiry pulse; these emotional states are often accompanied by abdominal or breast
distension.
   However, many other pa erns may cause premenstrual tension. Liver-Fire or Heart-
Fire, or both, may cause premenstrual tension manifesting with a propensity to outbursts
of anger, irritability and agitation, together with shouting, anxiety, insomnia and dream-
disturbed sleep. Phlegm-Fire harassing upwards may also cause premenstrual tension
manifesting with similar symptoms, as well as mental confusion and hyperactivity; with
Phlegm-Fire there is also premenstrual breast swelling and pain.
   Premenstrual tension may also be caused by Deficiency, and primarily Liver-Blood
deficiency, Liver- and Kidney-Yin deficiency, Spleen- and Kidney-Yang deficiency, and
Spleen-Qi deficiency with Dampness. In Deficiency premenstrual tension manifests
primarily with depression, crying, lack of motivation, feelings of heaviness, tiredness and
lassitude, and only a mild irritability.

          Premenstrual tension is not always due to Liver-Qi stagnation.
   Nausea or vomiting before the period denotes stagnant Liver-Qi invading the Stomach,
whereas premenstrual constipation with bi y stools and abdominal distension indicates
stagnant Liver-Qi invading the Intestines and Spleen. It is always important to ask
whether there is a change in bowel movements around period time because such changes
reflect the state of the Yang organs in a woman. Loose stools or constipation are frequent
symptoms appearing at period time. Constipation at period time may be due to stagnant
Liver-Qi invading the Intestines, Liver-Blood deficiency (with dry stools) or Kidney-Yang
deficiency (with infrequent movements), whereas loose stools may be due to Spleen-Qi
deficiency, stagnant Liver-Qi invading the Spleen (with abdominal distension) or Kidney-
Yang deficiency (with diarrhoea).
   Headaches before the period indicate Liver-Qi stagnation or Liver-Yang rising.
Distension of the breasts denotes Liver-Qi stagnation, but if the breasts become very
swollen and painful this may denote Phlegm (which, in premenstrual problems, usually
combines with Qi stagnation). Acute breast pain may be due to Toxic Heat in the breast,
such as happens in acute mastitis after childbirth.
   Retention of water with oedema before the period indicates Spleen-Yang or Kidney-
Yang deficiency, or both.
   Box 46.8 summarizes pa erns underlying premenstrual symptoms.

          BOX 46.8         PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS

    Other Symptoms Occurring Around Menstruation
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 85
   Headaches that occur during the period are usually due to Liver-Yang rising or Liver-
Fire blazing, occurring against a background of Blood-Heat. Headaches occurring after the
period indicate Liver-Blood deficiency.
   Constipation during the period may be due to Liver-Fire, whereas constipation after
the period is due to Blood or Kidney deficiency.
   Insomnia during the period indicates Blood-Heat, often with Liver-Fire or Heart-Fire,
or both. Insomnia after the period denotes Blood deficiency.
   Diarrhoea after the period indicates Spleen-Yang or Kidney-Yang deficiency, or both.

    PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
Fertility
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapters 86 and 89
   Infertility can be due to many diﬀerent deficient or excess conditions. These are:

         • Blood deficiency
         • Kidney deficiency
         • stasis of Blood
         • Cold in the Uterus
         • Damp-Phlegm.
   A slight feeling of nausea in the first 3 months of pregnancy is normal; persistent
vomiting during the first 3 months of pregnancy, or even continuing over the following
months, is a pathological sign which usually indicates rebellious Qi in the Penetrating
Vessel aﬀecting the Stomach channel. This can occur against a background of Stomach
deficiency or Stomach-Heat.
   Oedema during pregnancy indicates Kidney-Yang deficiency. High blood pressure
denotes a Kidney deficiency with Liver-Yang rising: this may herald a pre-eclampsia state
which is also characterized by headache, dizziness and blurred vision. A full eclampsia
state manifests with convulsions which, from a Chinese perspective, indicate the
development of Liver-Wind from Liver and Kidney deficiency.
   An aggravation or an amelioration of certain symptoms by pregnancy both indicate a
Kidney deficiency. Most people think that pregnancy is a weakening event in a woman's
life: in my opinion this is not so and a pregnancy can be weakening only if there is a pre-
existing Kidney deficiency and the woman does not look after herself. If any pre-existing
Kidney deficiency is not very severe and the woman looks after herself during pregnancy,
this event may actually strengthen the Kidneys (because menstruation itself is moderately
weakening and therefore its cessation can increase Blood and strengthen the Kidneys). For
this reason, an aggravation of certain symptoms during pregnancy indicates that the
Kidneys have been weakened by it, while an amelioration indicates that the Kidneys have
been strengthened. Common examples of diseases that may get be er or worse during
pregnancy are asthma, migraine and rheumatoid arthritis.

         Pregnancy is not necessarily-weakening to a woman's organism. It may
      have a neutral eﬀect or it may even have a strengthening eﬀect.
   Case histories 46.7 -46.9 illustrate some pa erns underlying problems with fertility.
        Case History 46.7
   A 45-year-old woman had been trying to conceive for 7 years; she did
have an 18-year-old child. Her periods were scanty lasting only 2 or 3 days,
she suﬀered from premenstrual tension and from abdominal distension
after the period; she also suﬀered from constipation and a dragging feeling
in the lower abdomen during the periods. Other symptoms elicited from
interrogation included backache, occasional dizziness, frequent urination
and nocturia. She also suﬀered from insomnia and anxiety. She was slightly
overweight and her eyes lacked sparkle to a severe degree.
   She had seen a gynaecologist and had had various tests and the Western
medicine diagnosis was endometriosis and ovarian cysts.
   Her tongue was slightly Pale and, although it had a sticky yellow
coating in the centre and root, it was Peeled on the sides and the front; her
pulse was Slippery in general, slightly Moving on the left Front and Middle
positions, Weak on both Rear positions and Rapid (112 b.p.m.).
   Diagnosis:
   This patient presents with a complex picture of pa erns. There is
definitely Dampness as evidenced by her being overweight, the dragging
feeling in the abdomen, the sticky tongue coating and the Slippery pulse.
Dampness is associated with Heat because the tongue coating is yellow.
Another pa ern is that of Kidney deficiency, which is manifested by the
backache, dizziness, frequent urination, nocturia, scanty periods and Weak
pulse on both Rear positions.
   The lack of sparkle in the eyes and the Moving and Rapid pulse suggest
the presence of a Heart pa ern, which is probably due to shock. This is
confirmed by the insomnia and the anxiety; the tongue is slightly Pale but
also Peeled in the front and we can therefore conclude that there is
deficiency of both Qi and Yin of the Heart. The premenstrual tension
indicates Liver-Qi stagnation but this is not a major problem in this case as
it is secondary to the Kidney deficiency; this is confirmed by the fact that
abdominal distension occurs after rather than before the period.

        Case History 46.8
   A 39-year-old woman had suﬀered from excessive body hair since the
onset of puberty at the age of 15. She had recently been diagnosed with
polycystic ovary syndrome after an ultrasound scan. Her menstrual cycle
was 5 weeks long, the period lasted 5-6 days and she had a white, jelly-like
vaginal discharge at mid-cycle.
   She often felt tired and her sleep was not good, regularly waking up
early in the morning. She had a tendency towards constipation and suﬀered
from haemorrhoids. Her hands and feet were often cold. Her mouth tended
to be dry and she had catarrh in her throat.
   The tongue was Swollen with Red sides and red points on the tip and
with a sticky yellow coating. The pulse was Deep-Weak and Slow (60
b.p.m.) overall, the right Front and left Rear positions being especially
Weak.
   Diagnosis:
   Excessive body hair and polycystic ovary syndrome often go hand in
hand and, in this case, are caused by Phlegm, which has developed as a
result of an underlying Kidney-Yang deficiency. While in Western medicine
the excessive growth of body hair is explained by an imbalance between
oestrogen and testosterone (with excessive levels of the la er), in Chinese
medicine it is due to a disharmony of the Penetrating Vessel: the
Penetrating Vessel is the Sea of Blood and a disharmony may cause the
Blood to promote the growth of body hair excessively. The Penetrating
Vessel disharmony is also indicated by the onset of the problem at puberty,
which is a time when the Directing and Penetrating Vessels are in a state of
transition and change and are therefore susceptible to disharmonies.
   The presence of Phlegm is confirmed by the Swollen tongue, the mid-
cycle vaginal discharge and the ovarian cysts themselves. The symptoms of
tiredness, constipation and cold extremities are due to the Kidney-Yang
deficiency, which is shown by the pulse being Deep-Weak and Slow,
especially in the left Rear position.
   The swelling and the redness of the sides of the tongue body, the sticky-
yellow tongue coating and the red points on the tip indicate Phlegm-Heat
aﬀecting probably the Lungs and Heart, but she has hardly any symptoms
of this apart from the dry mouth and the phlegm in the throat.

         Case History 46.9
   A 41-year-old woman had been trying to conceive for over a year
without success. During that year she did become pregnant once, but the
pregnancy was ectopic and she had to have her right tube removed. She
had already had a child two and a half years previously. She also
complained of feeling tired, exhausted, with low motivation and lack of
libido. Her sleep was disturbed and she occasionally experienced floaters
and night sweating.
   Her periods were quite normal, being regular, lasting 5 days and being
not too heavy or too scanty and not painful. She had a past history of
abdominal     pain    caused   by   pelvic   inflammatory   disease,   causing
dyspareunia (pain on intercourse) which had improved with acupuncture.
   Her tongue was practically normal, being only very slightly Pale on the
sides and with a slightly Red tip with red points. Her pulse was Wiry in
general and slightly Slippery and noticeably Full at the Middle level.
    Diagnosis:
   This case history is presented here as an example of the importance of
the pulse in diagnosis. On first analysis, it would appear that this patient
suﬀers from a Kidney deficiency which is causing her to be infertile, tired,
exhausted, lacking in motivation and libido. However, further questioning
aimed at confirming or excluding the Kidney deficiency did not reveal any
backache, dizziness or tinnitus. Moreover, she did conceive once resulting
in an ectopic pregnancy, which normally indicates an obstruction of the
Lower Burner from Dampness, Phlegm, stagnation of Qi or stasis of Blood;
therefore, if she is infertile, it is probably more from a Full condition than
from a Kidney deficiency. Furthermore, the pulse and the tongue do not
show a deficiency of the Kidneys or any other organ.
         The Wiry pulse clearly indicates severe stagnation of Qi, probably
      deriving from emotional problems, which is confirmed by the Red tip with
      red points on the tongue. Therefore we can conclude that her exhaustion,
      lack of motivation and lack of libido are due more to mental depression
      than to a Kidney deficiency. Moreover, the Full quality of the Middle level
      of the pulse (corresponding to Blood) confirms a condition of Blood stasis in
      the Uterus. Her past history of pelvic inflammatory disease and
      dyspareunia confirms this diagnosis.
         The treatment principle in this case therefore should be to move Qi,
      pacify the Liver, invigorate Blood and calm the Mind.

    Miscarriage And Abortion
   It is important to ask about miscarriages and abortion as they weaken a woman's body.
There is a saying in Chinese gynaecology that states: ‘Miscarriage is more serious than
childbirth.' It is easy to understand why this should be so: during a miscarriage there is a
heavy loss of blood; moreover, from a mental-emotional point of view, it means a great
loss to the woman with ensuing sadness and grief, which are often underestimated.
   Abortion is also weakening but to a lesser degree because there is not the loss of blood
that occurs during a spontaneous miscarriage.
   Miscarriage before 3 months indicates a Kidney deficiency, whereas miscarriage after 3
months denotes sinking of Spleen-Qi, Liver-Blood stasis or Blood-Heat.

    Childbirth
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 87
   There are several main areas of questioning with regard to the conditions of labour.
Nausea and heavy bleeding after labour may be caused by exhaustion of the Penetrating
Vessel. Sweating with fever after labour is due to exhaustion of Qi and Blood.
   Postnatal depression is caused by Liver-Blood and Heart-Blood deficiency. Postnatal
psychosis indicates a stasis of Blood in the Uterus and Heart.

    Lactation
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 87
   Breast milk not flowing (agalactia) after childbirth may be due to Blood deficiency,
Stomach and Spleen deficiency or Liver-Qi stagnation. Spontaneous flow of milk after
childbirth may be due to Spleen-Qi deficiency, Stomach-Heat or Liver-Fire.
   Mastitis after childbirth is due to Toxic Heat in the Stomach channel.

     INTRODUCTION
   The interrogation of children, especially young children, obviously needs to
be carried out with the help of the child's parents or other relatives. In older
children (over the age of 5 years), although we still need the help of the parents
in describing the child's symptoms and signs, it is important to listen carefully to
the child as well. When asking children about their symptoms, we should
obviously avoid the use of diﬃcult medical terms such as ‘abdomen' and use
colloquial terms such as ‘tummy'.
   Most of the questions related to adults discussed in the previous chapters
apply to children as well (e.g. digestive system and taste, thirst, defecation,
urination, etc.). There are, however, several questions which pertain only to
children and these are the mother's pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum problems,
immunizations and childhood diseases. In addition to the above areas of
questioning, questions about the child's digestive system, respiratory symptoms,
earache, and sleep are also important and have a slightly diﬀerent significance to
that in adults.
    MOTHER'S PREGNANCY
   The period in the womb is extremely important in influencing the
constitution of the baby. Many factors aﬀect the baby and its constitution in the
gestation period. Emotional shocks to the mother can aﬀect the child's nervous
system and the Heart. The consumption of alcohol and recreational drugs and
smoking obviously aﬀect the child's constitution adversely.
   When a baby cries a lot at night and vomits frequently, this may be due to
what the Chinese called ‘womb Heat', which itself may be due either to the
pregnant mother's consumption of excessively hot foods or, more commonly, to
her suﬀering from shock during pregnancy. Prenatal shock may also manifest
with a bluish tinge on the baby's forehead and chin.
   The influence of pregnancy events on the baby's health is discussed also in
Chapter 48 .

    CHILDBIRTH
   The conditions of childbirth also have an important influence on the baby's
constitution. Premature cu ing of the umbilical cord, induction or a Caesarean
birth can all aﬀect the baby's constitution adversely and in particular may cause
a Lung deficiency. Therefore if a baby or very young child suﬀers from a Lung
deficiency, this may be due to the above mentioned conditions in childbirth.

    POSTPARTUM PROBLEMS
   The main question to ask is about breast feeding: lack of breast feeding or too
short breast feeding often adversely aﬀects a baby's digestive system causing
either a Stomach deficiency or retention of food in the Stomach. Giving solid
food to babies too early (before 6 months of age) is a very common cause of
retention of food in babies and children.

    CHILDHOOD DISEASES
   We should always ask parents about their child's childhood diseases. A
history of several childhood diseases with rashes (e.g. measles, chickenpox,
German measles) suggests the child's tendency to Heat. Whooping cough has a
weakening eﬀect on the child's lungs and this may cause a weak Lung
constitution and the tendency to develop Lung pa erns later in life.

    DIGESTIVE SYMPTOMS
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 90
   Digestive symptoms are very common in children owing to the Stomach and
Spleen being inherently weak at birth; the younger the child, the more common
are digestive symptoms. The two most common causes of abdominal pain in
children are retention of Cold in the Stomach and Intestines and stagnation of Qi
in the Intestines. In babies, retention of food (called Accumulation Disorder in
babies) is very common and it manifests with vomiting of milk and with colic.

     IMMUNIZATIONS
   A full discussion on immunizations is beyond the scope of this book. To
understand the eﬀect of immunizations from a Chinese perspective it is
necessary to refer to the theory of the Four Levels (see Part 6 ). When a
pathogenic factor invades the body, it enters the Defensive-Qi level first and, if
not expelled, progresses through the Qi, Nutritive-Qi and Blood levels. The Four
Levels represent four diﬀerent energetic layers of penetration of Heat, the
Defensive-Qi level being the most superficial and the Blood level the deepest.
   From a Chinese perspective, therefore, immunizations basically consist in
injecting a ‘pathogenic factor' (i.e. the live or a enuated germ) directly at the
Blood level. This may cause Latent Heat to develop at the Blood level, which
may cause problems to the child both in the short term and in the long term.
   In the short term, Latent Heat may cause a skin rash, insomnia and a
temporary change in the child's character. The long-term eﬀects of
immunizations are more diﬃcult to establish and are the subject of great
controversy. However, if immunizations lead to Latent Heat at the Blood level, it
is quite possible that they may have serious long-term eﬀects. These include
brain damage, possibly autism, asthma, chronic cough, allergies and skin
diseases later in life.
   The eﬀect of immunizations from the Chinese perspective is discussed also in
Chapter 48 .

          Immunizations are a common cause of Latent Heat in children,
       which may persist into adulthood.

     RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS AND
EARACHE
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 90
   Questions concerning cough, wheezing, breathlessness or earache are always
important in the child's interrogation because children are very prone to
invasions of Wind, which may cause the above symptoms.

     Coughs And Wheezing
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 90
   A history of repeated bouts of cough and wheezing nearly always indicates a
residual pathogenic factor (usually Lung Phlegm-Heat) following invasions of
external Wind. These give rise to a residual pathogenic factor when the Wind is
not cleared properly, when antibiotics are used too frequently or when the child
has a weak constitution. In such cases the child will suﬀer from a chronic cough
or wheezing, or both, and will be prone to frequent respiratory infections.

     Earache
   Symptoms and Signs, Chapter 90
   A history of chronic earache also indicates the presence of a residual
pathogenic factor, which, in this case, is usually Damp-Heat in the Gall-Bladder
channel. This is also the result of frequent, acute ear infections usually treated by
the repeated administration of antibiotics, which only makes ma ers worse by
promoting the development of a residual pathogenic factor.

          BOX 47.1        INFLUENCES ON CHILDREN
      AND CHILDREN's SYMPTOMS
          • Mother's pregnancy: ‘womb Heat', prenatal shock
          • Childbirth: Lung deficiency
          • Postpartum problems: Stomach deficiency, retention of food
      in the Stomach
          • Childhood diseases: rashes (tendency to Heat), weak Lung
      constitution after whooping cough
          • Digestive symptoms: retention of Cold in Stomach and
      Intestines, stagnation of Qi in Intestines, Accumulation Disorder
          • Cough and wheezing: invasions of Wind, residual
      pathogenic factor
          • Earache: residual pathogenic factor, usually Damp-Heat in
      Gall-Bladder
          • Chronic catarrh: Phlegm
          • Disturbed sleep: retention of food and Stomach-Heat
      (babies), Liver-Fire, Stomach-Heat or retention of food (older
      children)
          • Immunizations: Latent Heat
          • Slow development (Five Retardations): congenital weakness
      of Liver, Kidney, Stomach, Heart

     Chronic Catarrh
   The condition of chronic catarrh is very common in children and this is the
consequence of a residual pathogenic factor after repeated invasions of Wind
combined with a Spleen deficiency, leading to the formation of Phlegm. A child
with this condition will have a constantly runny nose or a blocked nose, cough
and glue ear.

    SLEEP
   We should always ask about sleep in babies and children because not only
does it give us an indication of the state of the Mind but also a disturbance of
sleep often reflects the presence of certain pathogenic factors.
   Disturbed sleep with crying in babies is often due to retention of food and
Stomach-Heat, in which case the baby will cry out loudly. If the baby cries
relatively quietly during the night, it may be due to a prenatal shock.
   Disturbed sleep in older children may be due to the same factors as in adults
but the most common ones are Liver-Fire, Stomach-Heat and retention of food.

    SLOW DEVELOPMENT
   Slow development in children was summarized in ancient China as the ‘Five
Retardations'. These consist in slow development in standing, walking, teeth
growth, hair growth and speech.
   Slow development is caused primarily by congenital weakness of the Liver
and Kidneys with the Kidneys aﬀecting standing, teeth growth and hair growth
and the Liver aﬀecting standing and walking. Among postnatal causes, the
Stomach influences walking and the Heart speech. Figure 47.1 illustrates the
influence of prenatal and postnatal deficiencies on the Five Retardations.

 INTRODUCTION
   As mentioned earlier, the identification of the possible causes of patients'
disharmony is linked to general enquiries about their emotional life, working life,
diet, past history of shocks or traumas, family history and environmental influences.
I usually begin by carrying out a specific interrogation to identify the pa erns of
disharmony before delving into these aspects of a patient's life. It is important not to
confuse the general interrogation to find the causes of disease with the specific
interrogation to identify the pa erns of disharmony.
   Identifying the causes of disease is not easy and therefore not always possible, but
to try to do so is important as it is only by finding the causes of disease that we can
help the patient to eliminate or minimize them if at all possible. Even if the patient
can do nothing about a particular cause that is rooted in the past (such as an earlier
accident), its identification is still important in order that we may channel our advice
to the patient along the right lines. For example, there is no point in delving deeply
into a patient's emotional life if the cause of the problem is a past accident; vice versa,
there is no point in tinkering with a patient's diet or suggesting strict dietary
prohibitions if the cause of the problem is clearly emotional.
   One of the strengths of Chinese medicine, when compared with some branches of
modern complementary medicine that consider a particular cause of disease to the
exclusion of all others, is precisely that it contemplates many diﬀerent causes of
disease without a particular emphasis on one or another.
   Traditionally the causes of disease were diﬀerentiated according to three broad
categories: external (due to climate), internal (due to emotions), and miscellaneous.
Nowadays, this classification is no longer relevant (not least because some of the
most important causes of disease are in the ‘miscellaneous' group) and we need not
follow it. The main causes of disease, listed in approximate order of their importance
and frequency are:

          • heredity
          • emotions
          • overwork
          • diet
          • climate
          • trauma
          • drugs including immunizations
          • ‘recreational' drugs
          • excessive sexual activity.
   I find that, when identifying a cause or causes of disease, it is helpful to divide a
person's life into five distinct ages (see below). Because each cause of disease is more
prevalent during a certain period of life, establishing when the cause arose helps us
to identify the disease. There seldom is only one cause of disease; nearly always a
disease results from the combination of at least two causes. Usually one cause occurs
at a certain point of the patient's life, then, some years later, another cause intervenes
and the combination of the two triggers a disharmony (Fig. 48.1 ). Some examples
will be given below.

  INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CAUSES OF
DISEASE
Interaction Of Trauma With Climate
   A trauma to a knee that occurred at a young age when the patient was playing
sports may heal without any apparent consequence but when, years later, the patient
is then subject to invasion of Cold and Dampness (when he goes out walking in the
rain and remains in wet clothes for the whole day), he may develop Painful
Obstruction Syndrome in that knee. A previous trauma, in fact, often explains the
unilaterality of a particular joint problem.

     Interaction Of Hereditary Weak Constitution With
Diet
   A girl is born with a weak Stomach and Spleen constitution, which appears to
improve after the age of 7, as often happens. When the girl reaches 14 she becomes a
vegetarian. Her diet now consists mainly of cheese and salads; this interacts with the
pre-existing weak Stomach and Spleen constitution to cause Spleen-Qi deficiency and
possibly also Blood deficiency.

     Interaction Of Emotional Problems At Puberty And
Overwork
   A girl suﬀers deep emotional traumas around the time of puberty, owing to
family conflicts. These have no apparent eﬀect until she is an older woman. At the
age of 27 she is working very hard and for very long hours; the emotional problems
at puberty (which aﬀect the Directing and Penetrating vessels) interact with the
overwork later in life to cause gynaecological problems, possibly endometriosis.

     Interaction Of Weak Heart Constitution And
Emotional Problems
   A child is born with a weak Heart constitution manifesting with a nervous
disposition, restlessness in sleep and a deep Heart crack on the tongue. At a later age,
the young man suﬀers deep emotional stress owing to relationship diﬃculties; the
interaction of a pre- existing weak Heart constitution and the subsequent emotional
problems causes serious Heart pa erns and possibly severe anxiety and depression.

    THE FIVE STAGES OF LIFE
   The patient's life can be diﬀerentiated into five stages:

           • childhood (from birth to puberty)
           • adolescence (from puberty to about 20 years)
           • young adulthood (from 20 to 40)
           • middle age (from 40 to 60)
           • old age (from 60 onwards).
   Of course, the above age limits are intended only as a guideline and individual
cases may diﬀer from them according to individual body conditions. For example, a
38-year-old person who is in very poor health could be included in the middle-aged
group, whereas a youthful and healthy 42-year-old person could be included in the
young adulthood age. The following are the main characteristics and possible
aetiology and pathology of these five ages.

    Childhood
   During early childhood there are only three possible causes of disease, that is,
weak hereditary constitution, irregular feeding and climate. Therefore, if a patient
has been suﬀering from a particular complaint since early childhood, this can be due
to one of these three causes. We can eliminate climate as a cause because it does not
usually cause long-lasting consequences (unless there is a residual pathogenic
factor), so the problem can therefore be due only to heredity or irregular feeding. An
example of such a problem is early-onset atopic disease (asthma and eczema), which
is usually due to a hereditary weakness of the Lungs' and Kidneys' Defensive-Qi
systems.
   A new possible cause of disease in young children is immunizations, which are
often the cause of chronic infections, sleep problems or hyperactivity.
   Older children's main causes of disease are primarily diet, climate, emotions and
traumas. For example, if a patient has been suﬀering from persistent headaches since
childhood, this could be due either to a trauma to the head or to irregular diet as a
child. The emotional life of a child is quite diﬀerent from that of an adult and a
child's emotional problems are largely the reflection of the family's emotional state.

    Adolescence
   Adolescence is a very vulnerable period of life both on a physical and on an
emotional level, especially for girls. Taking a careful history will often reveal the
onset of a particular problem during adolescence. For example, if a girl has been
suﬀering from headaches since the onset of the menarche (which can be established
only with very careful questioning) this most probably indicates Liver-Blood
deficiency (resulting in Liver-Yang rising) as the main cause of the problem. This, in
turn, is most probably due to dietary irregularity or an injudicious vegetarian diet.
   Skin problems from this age may also be due to the aggravation of Blood
deficiency with the onset of the menarche. If a young woman has been suﬀering from
painful periods ever since their onset, this almost certainly points to invasion of Cold
in the Uterus during early adolescence when the Uterus is in a particularly
vulnerable state.
   Adolescence is also a vulnerable time from the emotional point of view and deep
emotional problems in a young adult often stem from that time.

     Young Adulthood
   Many events characterize the early young adulthood, for example leaving home,
change of diet, sexual activity, and infections.
   Leaving home often coincides with a deterioration in the young person's dietary
habits characterized by irregular meals, eating ‘fast foods', and often becoming
vegetarian. When practised without a proper understanding of nutrition, a
vegetarian diet may lead to Blood deficiency, especially in girls. Therefore, digestive
problems later in life often have their root in the early 20s.
   Young adulthood is also the time of emotional stress deriving from work,
relationships and unresolved family situations. The pulse reflects the emotional cause
of disease quite accurately. For example, if the Lung pulse is somewhat full and the
patient looks sad, it may be due to sadness or grief which has not been expressed (the
fullness of the Lung pulse would indicate this). If the Lung pulse is particularly Weak
and without wave and the eyes lack lustre, I may enquire whether events in the
patient's life have caused sadness or grief.
   If the Heart pulse is Overflowing and there is a Heart crack on the tongue, I may
ask if the patient has suﬀered from a shock. If the Heart pulse is Choppy, the
complexion dull, the eyes lustreless and the voice weak and weepy, it often indicates
long-standing sadness.
   If the pulse is Wiry on all positions, I may enquire whether there is some situation
in the patient's life that is causing frustration, anger or resentment.
   The pulse, complexion and eyes often point to the true emotion underlying the
disease, sometimes even contradicting the patient's own perception. For example, a
patient complained of various symptoms which she a ributed to the anger she felt at
having suﬀered sexual abuse as a teenager. Her therapist had also identified anger as
a cause of her symptoms. However, her very pale complexion, sad eyes and Weak
pulse without wave, especially on the Lung position, showed a diﬀerent picture; in
other words, all the signs pointed to sadness and grief as the predominant emotions.
I therefore asked her how she felt about her past experiences and she confirmed that
those were the predominant emotions.
   Another case showed almost the opposite situation. A young woman complained
of premenstrual tension and depression; she looked quite sad and her voice was
somewhat weepy. However, her pulse was not weak but somewhat full; in particular,
it was Moving, especially on the Heart position. I asked her if she had suﬀered a
shock during childhood and she burst into tears, telling me about sexual abuse
suﬀered from an uncle.

     Middle Age
   The main causes of disease in middle age are emotions, overwork and diet.
   The emotional state of middle age may take two opposite directions: some people
have been able to resolve the emotional problems of their youth and have se led into
a way of life that pays a ention to the needs of the Self; for others, middle age is a
time of crisis and emotional turmoil when every aspect of their life is questioned.
Most people overcome this crisis to achieve a be er emotional balance.
   Overwork is probably the most important cause of disease in middle age. This
comes about because middle age is a time when people usually reach the peak of
their profession, which imposes the heaviest demands. Unfortunately, this comes at a
time when our energy is naturally declining and Kidney-Qi begins to decline too.
Most people make unreasonable demands on their own bodies; they expect their
energy to be the same as when they were in their 30s or even 20s, and have no idea
about the need for rest; they think it is ‘normal' to get up at 6.30 in the morning, catch
a train at 7.30, work all day under conditions of stress, eat a sandwich at their desk
for lunch without any interruption from work, and return home at 9 in the evening.
This constitutes ‘overwork' and is a major cause of Kidney deficiency in the Western
world.

     Old Age
   Old age is a time when causes of disease have a lesser impact than in any other
period of life. Generally speaking, past causes of disease are already well entrenched
and usually no new causes of disease play a role. This is not because diet or
emotional problems do not aﬀect the elderly but because any cause of disease at this
time of one's life inevitably has its roots in the distant past; for this reason, a change
in habits is somewhat less important in the elderly than at any other time of life,
particularly with regard to diet. For example, if an 85-year-old man suﬀers from
Phlegm due to a lifelong excessive consumption of greasy foods, a change in diet at
this late time of life will have li le impact on his organism (although it may still be
advisable for him to make these changes). Of course, that is not to say that other
changes in life's habits do not have an impact on a person's health: for example, it is
never too late to explore the root of one's emotional problems or to take up exercise.

     THE CAUSES OF DISEASE
Heredity
   The constitutional body condition inherited from our parents depends on three
factors:

           1. The parents' health in general
         2. The parents' health at the time of conception
         3. The conditions of the mother's pregnancy.
   Any of these factors can aﬀect the body condition and become a cause of disease
later in life. If the parents' Qi and Essence are weak, the child's resulting Pre-Heaven
Essence will also be weak. Similarly, if the mother conceives in later life, this can
result in a Kidney or Liver deficiency starting during childhood.
   Even though the parents' general health may be good, if it is poor at the time of
the child's conception (perhaps through overwork, excessive sexual activity,
excessive consumption of alcohol, or use of certain medications or drugs such as
cannabis or cocaine), this will result in the child's having a weak constitution. In this
case, the weakness will aﬀect not the Kidneys or Liver, but any of the other organs
(i.e. Spleen, Lungs or Heart), depending on what particular condition is negatively
aﬀecting the parents' health. For example, if a parent has been overworking at the
time of conception, his or her poor health may cause hereditary Spleen weakness in
the child; excessive consumption of alcohol or the use of drugs or certain medicines
may cause a hereditary weakness of the child's Heart or Liver.
   The mother's condition during the pregnancy can aﬀect the fetus. For example, an
accident to the mother can cause headaches later in the child. A shock during
pregnancy can cause a baby to cry during sleep or a child to suﬀer nightmares (this
will also manifest with a bluish tinge on the forehead and chin).
   The clinical manifestations of a poor constitution in each of a child's organs are
indicated below. Possible causes arising during pregnancy for each such constitution
will be given, but we must obviously bear in mind that the manifestation may result
from a constitutional weakness in one or both parents and not necessarily from what
happened during pregnancy.

     Weak-Spleen constitution
   Manifestations of this constitution include flaccid muscles alongside the spine,
digestive problems, vomiting, diarrhoea and a sallow complexion; the child may be
quiet, with a thin body, or fat if there is Phlegm when newborn but becoming thinner
after 1 month.
   The cause of a weak Spleen constitution is usually to be found in improper diet or
the mother's overworking during pregnancy.

     Weak-Lung constitution
   Manifestations of this constitution include a white complexion, fear, shyness,
proneness to colds, whooping cough, asthma and eczema, a thin chest, a ‘special'
Lung pulse (Fig. 48.2 ) and Lung cracks on tongue.

                                          __.,.

      FIG. 48.2   Special Lung pulse
   In pregnancy, the causes of this constitution are usually emotional upsets to the
mother, especially sadness or grief. Of course, smoking during pregnancy also aﬀects
the baby's Lungs negatively.

     Weak-Heart constitution
   Manifestations of this constitution include a bluish tinge on the forehead, fear,
crying at night, and a Heart crack on the tongue; the child may be tense, with a hot
body, red eyes, red cheeks (or the opposite, i.e. very pale) and a Red tip of the
tongue.
   In pregnancy, this constitution may be caused by the mother's suﬀering a shock.

     Weak-Liver constitution
   Manifestations of this constitution include myopia or headaches from an early
age; the child may be very tense with a sinewy body, nocturnal enuresis, restless
sleep, twitching in sleep, screaming during sleep, feeding a lot as a baby, hungry as a
child, short-tempered, a Wiry pulse and a Red tongue with coating.
   In pregnancy, this constitution may be caused by the mother's emotional stress
and anger.

     Weak-Kidney constitution
   Manifestations of this constitution include nocturnal enuresis; the child may be
listless or timid, with lassitude, a thin body, slow development in babyhood, atopic
asthma and eczema, headaches from an early age, frequent urination and generally
feel cold.
   In pregnancy, this constitution may be caused by the mother's overworking.

     Emotions
   Emotions are mental stimuli which influence our aﬀective life. Under normal
circumstances, they are not a cause of disease. Indeed, ‘emotions' should be more
appropriately called ‘feelings' and feelings are a natural expression of human life.
Without feelings, we would not be human. Hardly any human being can avoid being
angry, sad, aggrieved, worried, or afraid at some time in his or her life. For example,
the death of a relative provokes a very natural feeling of grief. It is only when such
feelings take over our life inappropriately and disturb our psyche and body that they
become pathological; when this happens, feelings have turned into ‘moods'.
   Moods often arise precisely when feelings are suppressed; for example, if a
certain situation makes us angry and we recognize the anger we can deal with it and
perhaps even come to the conclusion that part of the anger was a projection of our
own ‘Shadow'. In such a case, the anger is a normal feeling that will probably not
have pathological consequences. But if we fail to recognize our anger, this will be
driven to deeper levels of our psyche and turn into a ‘mood' that possesses us. We
‘possess' feelings, but moods possess us.
   Thus, emotions (or ‘feelings') become causes of disease only when they are
excessive, prolonged, suppressed, or unrecognized, in which case they turn into
moods. For example, hardly anyone can avoid being angry sometimes, but a
temporary state of anger does not lead to disease. However, if a person is constantly
angry about a certain situation in life for many years, or, even worse, if the anger is
not recognized, this emotion will definitely disturb the Mind and Spirit and cause
disease.
   In Chinese medicine, ‘emotions' (the term here signifies causes of disease, not
normal feelings) are mental stimuli which disturb the Mind and Spirit and, through
these, alter the balance of the Internal Organs and the harmony of Qi and Blood. For
this reason, emotional stress is an internal cause of disease which injures the Internal
Organs directly. Conversely, and this is a very important feature of Chinese
medicine, the state of the Internal Organs aﬀects our emotional state. For example, if
Liver-Yin is deficient (perhaps from dietary factors) and causes Liver-Yang to rise,
this may result in a person becoming irritable all the time. Vice versa, if a person is
constantly angry about a certain situation or with a particular person, this may cause
Liver-Yang to rise.
   The ‘Spiritual Axis' in Chapter 8 clearly illustrates the reciprocal relationship
between the emotions and the Internal Organs. It says: ‘The Heart's fear, anxiety and
pensiveness injure the Mind … the Spleen's worry injures the Intellect … the Liver's
sadness and shock injure the Ethereal Soul … the Lung's excessive joy injures the
Corporeal Soul … the Kidney's anger injures the Will-Power…'. 1 On the other hand,
further on it says: ‘If Liver-Blood is deficient there is fear, if it is in excess there is
anger … if Heart-Qi is deficient there is sadness, if it is in excess there is manic
behaviour …' 2
   These two passages clearly show that, on the one hand, emotional stress injures
the Internal Organs and, on the other hand, disharmony of the Internal Organs
causes emotional imbalance.
   The emotions taken into consideration in Chinese medicine have varied over the
years. From a Five-Element perspective, the ‘Yellow Emperor's Classic' 3 considered
five emotions, each one aﬀecting a specific Yin organ:
         • anger aﬀecting the Liver
         • joy aﬀecting the Heart
         • pensiveness aﬀecting the Spleen
         • worry aﬀecting the Lungs
         • fear aﬀecting the Kidneys.
   However, these are not by any means the only emotions discussed in the ‘Yellow
Emperor's Classic'. In other passages sadness and shock are added, giving seven
emotions:

         • anger aﬀecting the Liver
         • joy aﬀecting the Heart
         • worry aﬀecting the Lungs and Spleen
         • pensiveness aﬀecting the Spleen
         • sadness aﬀecting the Lungs and Heart
         • fear aﬀecting the Kidneys
         • shock aﬀecting the Kidneys and Heart.
   Other doctors considered other emotions such as grief, love, hatred and desire
(craving).
   Finally, and interestingly, there is one last emotion which is not usually
mentioned in Chinese medicine, and that is guilt. Yet, in my opinion, guilt is very
pervasive in Western patients and definitely an emotional cause of disease.
   Thus, the list of emotions could be expanded as follows:

         • anger (and frustration and resentment) aﬀecting the Liver
         • joy aﬀecting the Heart
         • worry aﬀecting the Lungs and Spleen
         • pensiveness aﬀecting the Spleen
         • sadness (and grief) aﬀecting the Lungs
         • fear aﬀecting the Kidneys
         • shock aﬀecting the Kidneys and Heart
         • love aﬀecting the Heart
         • hatred aﬀecting the Heart and Liver
         • craving aﬀecting the Heart
         • guilt aﬀecting the Kidneys and Heart.
   The eﬀect of each emotion on a relevant organ should not be interpreted too
restrictively. There are passages from the ‘Yellow Emperor's Classic' that a ribute the
eﬀect of emotions to organs other than the ones just mentioned. For example, the
‘Spiritual Axis' in Chapter 28 says: ‘Worry and pensiveness agitate the Heart'. 4 The
‘Simple Questions' in Chapter 39 says: ‘Sadness agitates the Heart…' 5
   Furthermore, all emotions, besides aﬀecting the relevant organ directly, aﬀect the
Heart indirectly because the Heart houses the Mind. It alone, being responsible for
consciousness and cognition, can recognize and feel the eﬀect of emotional tension.
   Fei Bo Xiong (1800-1879) put it very clearly when he said:
        The seven emotions injure the 5 Yin organs selectively, but they all aﬀect the
    Heart. Joy injures the Heart … Anger injures the Liver, the Liver cannot
    recognize anger but the Heart can, hence it aﬀects both Liver and Heart. Worry
    injures the Lungs, the Lungs cannot recognize it but the Heart can, hence it
    aﬀects both Lungs and Heart. Pensiveness injures the Spleen, the Spleen cannot
    recognise it but the Heart can, hence it aﬀects both Spleen and Heart. 6
   Yu Chang in ‘Principles of Medical Practice' (1658) says: ‘Worry agitates the
Heart and has repercussions on the Lungs; pensiveness agitates the Heart and has
repercussions on the Spleen; anger agitates the Heart and has repercussions on the
Liver; fear agitates the Heart and has repercussions on the Kidneys. Therefore all the
five emotions [including joy] aﬀect the Heart'. 7 Chinese writing clearly bears out the
idea that all emotions aﬀect the Heart since the characters for all seven emotions are
based on the ‘heart' radical.
   The way that all emotions aﬄict the Heart also explains why a Red tip of the
tongue, indicating Heart-Fire, is so commonly seen even in emotional problems
related to other organs.
   The first eﬀect of emotional stress on the body is to impair the proper circulation
and direction of Qi. Qi is non-substantial and the Mind, with its mental and
emotional energies, is the most non-material type of Qi. It is therefore natural that
emotional stress aﬀecting the Mind impairs the circulation of Qi first of all.
   Each emotion is said to have a particular eﬀect on the circulation of Qi. The
‘Simple Questions' in Chapter 39 says: ‘ Anger makes Qi rise, joy slows down Qi,
sadness dissolves Qi, fear makes Qi descend … shock sca ers Qi … pensiveness
knots Qi …' 8 Dr Chen Yan in ‘A Treatise on the Three Categories of Causes of
Diseases' (1174) says: ‘Joy sca ers, anger arouses, worry makes Qi unsmooth,
pensiveness knots, sadness makes Qi tight, fear sinks, shock moves.' 9
   Again, this should not be taken too literally as, in certain cases, emotional
pressure may have a diﬀerent eﬀect on Qi from the one outlined above. For example,
fear is said to make Qi descend and it may cause enuresis, incontinence of urine or
diarrhoea, since the Kidneys control the two lower orifices (urethra and anus). This is
certainly true in cases of extreme and sudden fear, which may cause incontinence of
urine or diarrhoea, or in the case of children when anxiety about a certain family
situation may cause enuresis. However, the eﬀect of fear on Qi depends also on the
state of the Heart. If the Heart is strong, it will cause Qi to descend, but if the Heart is
weak, it will cause Qi to rise in the form of Empty-Heat. This is more common in old
people and in women. In such cases, fear and anxiety may weaken Kidney-Yin and
give rise to Empty-Heat of the Heart with such symptoms as palpitations, insomnia,
night sweating, a dry mouth, red face and a Rapid pulse.
   Box 48.1 summarizes the relationships between the seven emotions and the
Internal Organs.

          BOX 48.1         EMOTIONS AND THE INTERNAL
      ORGANS
          • Anger: Liver
          • Joy: Heart
          • Worry: Lungs and Spleen
          • Pensiveness: Spleen
          • Sadness: Lungs and Heart
          • Fear: Kidneys
          • Shock: Kidneys and Heart
   Let us now discuss the eﬀects of each emotion individually.

     Anger
   The term ‘anger', perhaps more than any other emotion, should be interpreted
very broadly to include several other allied emotional states, such as resentment,
repressed anger, feeling aggrieved, frustration, irritation, rage, indignation,
animosity, or bi erness.
   Any of these emotional states can aﬀect the Liver, if they persist for a long time,
causing stagnation of Liver-Qi or Blood, rising of Liver-Yang or blazing of Liver-Fire.
The eﬀect of anger on the Liver depends, on the one hand, on the person's reaction to
the emotional stimulus and, on the other hand, on other concurrent factors. If the
anger is bo led up it will cause stagnation of Liver-Qi, whereas if it is expressed it
will cause Liver-Yang rising or Liver-Fire blazing. In women, stagnation of Liver-Qi
may easily lead to stasis of Liver-Blood. Those who also suﬀer from some Kidney-Yin
deficiency (perhaps from excessive sexual activity) may develop Liver-Yang rising.
Those who, on the other hand, have a tendency to Heat (perhaps from excessive
consumption of hot foods) will tend to develop Liver-Fire blazing.
   Anger (intended in the broad sense outlined above) makes Qi rise and many of
the symptoms and signs will manifest in the head and neck, such as headaches,
tinnitus, dizziness, red blotches on the front part of the neck, a red face, thirst, a bi er
taste and a Red tongue with red sides.
   The ‘Simple Questions' in Chapter 39 says: ‘Anger makes Qi rise and causes
vomiting of blood and diarrhoea.' 10 It causes vomiting of blood because it makes
Liver-Qi and Liver-Fire rise and diarrhoea because it induces Liver-Qi to invade the
Spleen.
   Anger does not always manifest outwardly with outbursts of fury, irritability,
shouting, a red face, etc. Some individuals may carry anger inside them for years
without ever manifesting it. In particular, long-standing depression may be due to
repressed anger or resentment. A person who is very depressed may look subdued
and pale, walk slowly and speak with a low voice - all signs which one would
associate with a depletion of Qi and Blood deriving from sadness or grief. However,
when anger rather than sadness is the cause of disease, the pulse and tongue will
clearly show it: the pulse will be Full and Wiry and the tongue will be Red with
redder sides and with a dry yellow coating. This type of depression is most probably
due to long-standing resentment, often harboured towards a member of that person's
family.
   In some cases anger can aﬀect other organs, especially the Stomach. This can be
due to stagnant Liver-Qi invading the Stomach. Such a condition is more likely to
occur if one gets angry at mealtimes, which may happen if family meals become
occasions for regular rows. It also happens when there is a pre-existing weakness of
the Stomach, in which case the anger may aﬀect only the Stomach without even
aﬀecting the Liver.
   If one regularly gets angry an hour or two after meals, then the anger will aﬀect
the Intestines rather than the Stomach. This happens, for example, when one goes
straight back to a stressful and frustrating job after lunch. In this case, stagnant Liver-
Qi invades the Intestines and causes abdominal pain, distension and alternation of
constipation with diarrhoea.
   Finally, anger, like all other emotions, also aﬀects the Heart. This organ is
particularly prone to be aﬀected by anger also because, from a Five-Element
perspective, the Liver is the mother of the Heart and often Liver-Fire is transmi ed to
the Heart giving rise to Heart-Fire. Anger makes the Heart full with blood rushing to
it. With time, this leads to Blood-Heat aﬀecting the Heart and therefore the Mind.
According to Dr J. H. F. Shen, anger tends to aﬀect the Heart particularly when the
person does a lot of jogging or exercising; this is because excessive exercise dilates the
heart, which is then more prone to be aﬀected by the transmission of Fire from the
Liver to the Heart.
   In some cases, anger disguises other emotions such as guilt. Some people may
harbour guilt inside for many years and be unable or unwilling to recognize it; they
may then use anger as a mask for their guilt. Moreover, there are some families in
which everyone is perpetually angry. This happens more in Mediterranean countries
such as Italy, Spain or Greece. In these families, anger is used as a mask to hide other
emotions such as guilt, fear or dislike of being controlled, or to conceal weakness or
an inferiority complex. When this is the case, it is important to be aware of this
situation as one needs to treat not the anger but the underlying psychological and
emotional condition.
   Box 48.2 summarizes the eﬀects of anger.

           BOX 48.2        ANGER
           • Aﬀects the Liver (and Heart)
           • Makes Qi rise
           • Expressed anger causes Liver-Yang rising or Liver-Fire blazing
           • Repressed anger causes Liver-Qi stagnation
           • Anger at mealtimes aﬀects Stomach
           • Anger after eating aﬀects Intestines
           • Anger may disguise guilt

     Joy
   A normal state of joy is not in itself a cause of disease; on the contrary, it is a
beneficial mental state which favours a smooth functioning of the Internal Organs
and their mental faculties. The ‘Simple Questions' in Chapter 39 says: ‘Joy makes the
Mind peaceful and relaxed, it benefits the Nutritive and Defensive Qi and it makes
Qi relax and slow down.' 11 On the other hand, in Chapter 2 the same book says: ‘The
Heart … controls joy, joy injures the Heart, fear counteracts joy.' 12
   What is meant by ‘joy' as a cause of disease is obviously not a state of healthy
contentment but one of excessive excitement and craving, which can injure the Heart.
This happens to people who live in a state of continuous mental stimulation
(however pleasurable) or excessive excitement - in other words, a life of ‘hard
playing'.
   As indicated above, inordinate craving is an aspect of the emotion ‘joy' and it stirs
up the Minister Fire, which overstimulates the Mind.
   Joy, in the broad sense indicated above, makes the Heart larger. This leads to
excessive stimulation of the Heart, which, in time, may lead to Heart-related
symptoms and signs. These may deviate somewhat from the classical Heart pa erns.
The main manifestations would be palpitations, overexcitability, insomnia,
restlessness and talking a lot; the tip of the tongue would be red. The pulse would
typically be Slow, slightly Overflowing but Empty on the left Front position.
   Joy may also be marked out as a cause of disease when it is sudden; this happens,
for example, on hearing good news unexpectedly. In this situation, ‘joy' is akin to
shock. Fei Bo Xiong in ‘Medical Collection from Four Families from Meng He' says:
‘Joy injures the Heart … [it causes] Yang Qi to float and the blood vessels to become
too open and dilated…' 13 In these cases of sudden joy and excitement the Heart
dilates and slows down and the pulse becomes Slow and slightly Overflowing but
Empty. One can understand the eﬀect of sudden joy further if one thinks of situations
when a migraine a ack is precipitated by the excitement of suddenly hearing good
news. Another example of joy as a cause of disease is that of sudden laughter
triggering a heart a ack; this example also confirms the relationship existing between
the Heart and laughter.
   Finally, one can also get an idea of the eﬀects of joy as an emotion by considering
children, in whom overexcitement usually ends in tears.
   Box 48.3 summarizes the eﬀects of joy.

            BOX 48.3        JOY
            • Aﬀects the Heart
            • Makes Qi slow down
            • Joy is a state of excessive excitement/craving
            • Joy makes the heart larger

     Worry
   Worry is one of the most common emotional causes of disease in our society. The
extremely rapid and radical social changes that have occurred in Western societies in
the past decades have created a climate of insecurity and anxiety in all spheres of life.
Of course, there are also people who, because of a pre-existing disharmony of the
Internal Organs, are very prone to worry, even about very minor incidents in life. For
example, many people appear to be very tense and worry a lot. On close
interrogation about their work and family life, often nothing of note emerges. They
simply worry excessively about trivial everyday activities and they tend to do
everything in a hurry and be pressed for time. This may be due to a constitutional
weakness of the Spleen, Heart or Lungs, or a combination of these.
   Worry knots Qi, which means that it causes stagnation of Qi, and it aﬀects both
the Lungs and the Spleen: the Lungs because when one is worried breathing is
shallow, and the Spleen because this organ is responsible for thinking and ideas.
Worry is the pathological counterpart of the Spleen's mental activity in generating
ideas.
   In a few cases, worry may also aﬀect the Liver as a result of the stagnation of the
Lungs; in a Five-Element sense this corresponds to Metal insulting Wood. When this
happens, the neck and shoulders will tense up and become stiﬀ and painful.
   The symptoms and signs caused by worry will vary according to whether they
aﬀect the Lungs or the Spleen. If worry aﬀects the Lungs it disturbs the breathing
and the Corporeal Soul (Po ); this will cause an uncomfortable feeling in the chest,
slight breathlessness, anxiety, tensing of the shoulders, sometimes a dry cough and a
pale complexion. The right Front pulse position (of the Lungs) may feel slightly Tight
or Wiry, indicating the kno ing action of worry on Qi.
   If worry aﬀects the Spleen it may cause poor appetite, a slight epigastric
discomfort, some abdominal pain and distension, tiredness and a pale complexion.
The right Middle pulse position (Spleen) will feel slightly Tight but Weak. If worry
aﬀects the Stomach as well (which happens if one worries at mealtimes), the right
Middle pulse may be Weak-Floating.
   Box 48.4 summarizes the eﬀects of worry.

          BOX 48.4        WORRY
         • Aﬀects the Lungs, Heart and Spleen
         • Knots Qi
         • It may also aﬀect the Liver and Stomach
         • It aﬀects breathing and the Corporeal Soul (Po )

     Pensiveness
   Pensiveness is very similar to worry in its character and eﬀect. It consists in
brooding, constantly thinking about certain events or people (even though not
worrying), nostalgic hankering after the past and generally thinking intensely about
life rather than living it. In extreme cases, pensiveness leads to obsessive thoughts. In
a diﬀerent sense, pensiveness also includes excessive mental work in the process of
one's work or study.
   Pensiveness aﬀects the Spleen and, like worry, it knots Qi. It will therefore cause
similar symptoms to those outlined above. The only diﬀerence will be that the pulse
of the right side not only will feel slightly Tight, but will have no wave. One can feel
the normal pulse as a wave under the fingers moving from the Rear towards the
Front position. The pulse without wave lacks this flowing movement from Rear to
Front position and it is instead felt as if each individual position were separate from
the others (see Fig. 50.1 on p. 477 ). In the case of pensiveness, the pulse will lack a
wave only on the right Middle position. A pulse without wave in the Front and
Middle position indicates Sadness.
   Box 48.5 summarizes the eﬀects of pensiveness.

          BOX 48.5        PENSIVENESS
          • Aﬀects the Spleen and Heart
          • It knots Qi
          • In severe cases it leads to obsessive thoughts
          • ‘Pensiveness' include also excessive mental work

     Sadness and grief
   Sadness includes the emotion of regret, as when someone regrets a certain action
or decision in the past and the Mind is constantly turned towards that time. Sadness
and grief aﬀect the Lungs and Heart. In fact, according to the ‘Simple Questions',
sadness aﬀects the Lungs via the Heart. It says in Chapter 39 : ‘Sadness makes the
Heart cramped and agitated; this pushes towards the lungs' lobes, the Upper Burner
becomes obstructed, Nutritive and Defensive Qi cannot circulate freely, Heat
accumulates and dissolves Qi.' 14 According to this passage then, sadness primarily
aﬀects the Heart, and the Lungs suﬀer in consequence since they are both situated in
the Upper Burner. The Lungs govern Qi and sadness and grief deplete Qi. This is
often manifested on the pulse as a Weak quality on both left and right Front positions
(Heart and Lungs). In particular, the pulse on both Front positions is Short and has
no wave, that is, it does not flow smoothly towards the thumb. Other manifestations
deriving from sadness and grief include a weak voice, tiredness, pale complexion,
slight breathlessness, weeping and a feeling of oppression in the chest. In women,
deficiency of Lung-Qi from sadness or grief often leads to Liver-Blood deficiency and
amenorrhoea.
   Although sadness and grief deplete Qi, and therefore lead to deficiency of Qi,
they may also, after a long time, lead to stagnation of Qi, because the deficient Lung-
and Heart-Qi fail to circulate properly in the chest.
   As mentioned before, each emotion can aﬀect other organs apart from its ‘specific'
one. For example, the ‘Spiritual Axis' in Chapter 8 mentions injury of the Liver from
sadness rather than anger: ‘When sadness aﬀects the Liver it injures the Ethereal
Soul; this causes mental confusion … the Yin is damaged, the tendons contract and
there is hypochondrial discomfort.' 15 This shows how organs can be aﬀected by
emotions other than the one ‘specific' to them. In this case, sadness can naturally
aﬀect the Ethereal Soul and therefore Liver-Yin. Sadness has a depleting eﬀect on Qi
and it therefore, in some cases, depletes Liver-Yin leading to mental confusion,
depression, lack of a sense of direction in life and inability to plan one's life.
   Finally, some doctors consider that grief which is unexpressed and borne without
tears aﬀects the Kidneys. According to them, when grief is held in without weeping,
the fluids cannot come out (in the form of tears) and they upset the fluid metabolism
within the Kidneys. This would happen only in situations when grief had been felt
for many years.
   Box 48.6 summarizes the eﬀects of sadness and grief.

          BOX 48.6         SADNESS AND GRIEF
          • Aﬀect the Lungs and Heart
          • Deplete Qi
          • In time, they may also lead to stagnation of Qi
          • Sadness may also aﬀect Liver-Blood in women
          • Unexpressed grief without tears aﬀects the Kidneys

     Fear
   ‘Fear' includes both a chronic state of fear and anxiety, and a sudden fright. It
depletes Kidney-Qi and makes Qi descend. The ‘Simple Questions' in Chapter 39
says: ‘Fear depletes the Essence, it blocks the Upper Burner, which makes Qi descend
to the Lower Burner.' 16 Examples of Qi descending are nocturnal enuresis in children
and incontinence of urine or diarrhoea in adults, following a sudden fright.
   Situations of chronic anxiety and fear will have diﬀerent eﬀects on Qi depending
on the state of the Heart. If the Heart is strong, it will cause Qi to descend, but if the
Heart is weak, it will cause Qi to rise in the form of Empty-Heat. This is more
common in women and in old people of either sex as fear and anxiety weaken
Kidney-Yin and give rise to Empty-Heat of the Heart with such symptoms as
palpitations, insomnia, night sweating, a dry mouth, a malar flush and a Rapid pulse.
   If a person has a tendency to a constitutional weakness of the Heart (manifested
with a midline crack on the tongue extending all the way to the tip), fear will aﬀect
the Heart rather than the Kidneys.
   There are, however, other causes of fear that are not related to the Kidneys. Liver-
Blood deficiency and a Gall-Bladder deficiency can also make the person fearful.
   Box 48.7 summarizes the eﬀects of fear.

          BOX 48.7        FEAR
          • Aﬀects the Kidneys and Heart
          • Makes Qi descend (in theory)
          • May also make Qi ascend (in my opinion)

     Shock
   Mental shock sca ers Qi and aﬀects the Heart and Kidneys. It causes a sudden
depletion of Heart-Qi, makes the Heart smaller and may lead to palpitations,
breathlessness and insomnia. This is often reflected in the pulse with the Moving
quality, that is, a pulse that is short, slippery, shaped like a bean, rapid and gives the
impression of vibrating as it pulsates.
   Shock also ‘closes' the Heart or makes the Heart smaller. This can be observed in
a bluish tinge on the forehead and a Heart pulse which is Tight and Fine.
   Shock also aﬀects the Kidneys because the body draws on the Kidney-Essence to
supplement the sudden depletion of Qi. For this reason, shock can cause such
symptoms as night sweating, a dry mouth, dizziness, or tinnitus.
   Box 48.8 summarizes the eﬀects of shock.

          BOX 48.8        SHOCK
          • Aﬀects Kidneys, Spleen and Heart
          • Suspends Qi, causes a sudden depletion of Heart-Qi
          • Makes heart smaller or ‘closes' it
     Love
   ‘Love' here means not normal love, such as that of a mother towards her child or
that between two lovers, but rather the condition when love becomes an obsession or
when it is misdirected, as when a person loves someone who is persistently hurtful.
In this context, ‘love' indicates a rather obsessive love for a particular person, a
misdirected emotion focusing on someone who persistently hurts the lover, whether
physically or mentally, or narcissistic love. Obsessive jealousy would also fall under
this broad category. In these senses, love becomes a cause of disease.
   ‘Love' in the sense outlined above aﬀects the Heart and quickens Qi. This will be
felt on the left Front position (Heart) with an Overflowing quality, and the pulse will
also be rapid. It may cause such symptoms and signs as palpitations, a red tip of the
tongue, a red face, insomnia and mental restlessness.
   Box 48.9 summarizes the eﬀects of ‘love'.

          BOX 48.9         ‘LOVE'
          • Aﬀects the Heart
          • Quickens Qi
          • Consists of:

                     — obsessive love
                     — misdirected love (towards a person
             who hurts us)
                     — jealousy and possessiveness
                     — narcissistic love

     Hatred
   Hatred is quite similar to anger but diﬀers from it in so far as it indicates a ‘cold'
and calculating malice rather than the uncontrollable and spontaneous outbursts that
are typical of anger. When harboured for many years, hatred is a very damaging and
destructive emotion. It aﬀects the Heart and Liver and it knots and slows down Qi. It
can be felt on the pulse of the left-hand side with a Wiry but Slow quality. The
symptoms and signs caused by hatred include chest pain, hypochondriac pain,
insomnia, headache and palpitations. These manifestations include pain in some part
of the body as, when hatred is felt for many years, it turns inwards to injure only the
person feeling it.
   Box 48.10 summarizes the eﬀects of hatred.

          BOX 48.10        HATRED
          • Aﬀects the Liver and Heart
          • Similar to anger
          • Knots and slows down Qi

     Craving
   ‘Desire' means excessive craving. The inclusion of this as a cause of disease
reflects the Buddhist influence on Chinese medicine, which began during the Tang
dynasty. The ultimate cause of disease according to Buddhist thought is desire, that
is, clinging to external objects or other people and always wanting more. This
excessive craving, which is one aspect of the emotion of ‘joy' in Chinese medicine,
causes the Minister Fire to blaze upwards and harass the Mind. By this is meant a
state of constant craving which is never satisfied. This can include craving for
material objects or recognition.
   Craving aﬀects the Heart and it sca ers Qi. Craving also aﬀects the Pericardium
by stirring the Minister Fire. In disease, Minister Fire refers to a pathological Empty-
Fire arising from the Kidneys; it aﬀects the Pericardium and therefore the Mind. 17 If
the Mind is calm, se led and content, the Pericardium follows its direction and there
is a happy and balanced life. If the Mind is weak and dissatisfied, the Pericardium
follows the demands of the craving and the person constantly desires new objects or
new marks of recognition, which, however, even when a ained, are never satisfying
and leave the person more frustrated. It is for these reasons that both Daoism and
Buddhism put the emphasis on reducing craving to prevent the arousal of Minister
Fire, which stirs the Mind.
   Craving will cause Heart-Fire or Heart Empty-Heat depending on the underlying
condition of the person. If there is a tendency to Yin deficiency, which is common in
people who tend to overwork, it will lead to Heart Empty-Heat. This will cause
palpitations, a malar flush, a dry throat, insomnia and mental restlessness.
   Box 48.11 summarizes the eﬀects of craving.

          B O X 4 8 . 11      CRAVING
          • Aﬀects the Heart and Pericardium
          • Sca ers Qi
          • Akin to ‘joy'

     Guilt
   Guilt is an extremely common emotion and a cause of disease in the West. A
feeling of guilt may derive from the transgression of social or religious taboos or
from having done something wrong which is later regre ed. People who are prone to
blame themselves for everything that goes wrong may also suﬀer an unjustified and
subjective sense of guilt.
   Guilt aﬀects the Heart and Kidneys and it causes Qi either to stagnate or to sink.
It may cause stagnation of Qi in the chest, epigastrium, or abdomen, and its clinical
manifestations include an uncomfortable feeling in the chest, epigastric or abdominal
pain and distension and a Fine pulse. The tongue will have a red tip and the pulse
will be vibrating as it pulsates. The eyes will look unstable and often flap shut while a
person is talking.
   If it aﬀects the Kidneys, guilt may cause Qi to sink giving rise to urinary problems
such as a slight incontinence, dribbling of urine and a bearing-down feeling in the
hypogastrium.
   In some cases, guilt may also arise from the repression of anger. When anger is
repressed and not recognized, it may turn inwards and cause an a itude of self-
punishment and guilt. When guilt results from repressed anger, the pulse will be
Wiry.
   Box 48.12 summarizes the eﬀects of guilt.

           BOX 48.12         GUILT
          • Aﬀects the Kidneys and Heart
          • May cause sinking or stagnation of Qi

     Overwork
   By ‘overwork' I mean not physical work but the habit of working long hours
every day without adequate rest, usually accompanied by irregular eating for many
years. As stated earlier, someone who ‘overworks' leaves home perhaps at 7 in the
morning, catches a train to work, works under stressful conditions through the lunch
hour (eating a sandwich at the desk), and returns home at about 9 in the evening.
When such a routine is carried out for many years, it constitutes what I call
‘overwork'. It is an extremely common cause of disease in Western patients about
which they need to be educated. Most people who follow such a routine at work are
surprised when I suggest to them that they work too much and that their working
habits might have something to do with their illness.
   Overwork as defined above is probably the most common cause of Yin deficiency
in the patients we see. It depletes primarily Kidney-Yin but also Liver- and Stomach-
Yin, depending on the circumstances. In women, it is likely to injure Liver-Yin as well
as Kidney-Yin; on the other hand, when overwork is associated with an irregular diet
(as it often is), it injures Stomach-Yin.

     Diet
   Diet influences our health in two main ways: first through our choice of foods,
and secondly through our eating habits.

     Choice of foods
   Our choice of foods can become unbalanced in four main ways: eating too much
cold food, eating too much hot food, eating too much greasy food, and not eating
enough.

     Eating too much cold food
   ‘Cold' food includes raw fruit, raw vegetables and cold drinks. Patients are often
surprised to be told that an excessive consumption of such foods might be
detrimental as this advice runs counter to the prevailing view of ‘healthy' eating, that
is, eating lots of fruit and salads in order to secure the maximum intake of vitamins
and minerals. It is true that raw foods are rich in vitamins and minerals and a small
consumption of such foods is not detrimental and indeed healthy. It becomes
detrimental from the point of view of Chinese medicine only when the mainstay of
someone's diet is exclusively raw fruit and vegetables.
   Excessive consumption of cold foods (including cold drinks) injures the Spleen
and leads to internal Cold in the body. This will cause a pale complexion, loose
stools, tiredness, a feeling of cold, and abdominal pain.

     Eating too much hot food
   ‘Hot' foods include red meat (especially lamb, beef and game), spices and alcohol.
Excessive consumption of hot foods causes Heat in the Internal Organs and will
manifest with a red complexion, a feeling of heat, thirst, insomnia, mental
restlessness and a Red tongue.

     Eating too much greasy food
   ‘Greasy' foods include all dairy foods, bananas and peanuts. In addition, this
category includes foods cooked in animal fats, and fried or deep-fried foods. Sugar is
also a ‘greasy' food.
   Greasy foods lead to the formation of Dampness or Phlegm, or both, and an
excessive consumption of such foods is extremely common in Western countries,
especially in the USA and Northern European countries.

     Not eating enough
   In aﬄuent countries, ‘not eating enough' is due to following a restrictive diet,
often aimed at slimming, and may also result from following a vegetarian diet
injudiciously, especially in women. Many young girls become vegetarian and, not
having a good knowledge of food combining, they tend to eat a lot of salads and
cheese, which injure the Spleen and lead to Dampness. Such girls will tend to be pale
and suﬀer from tiredness, digestive problems, loose stools and menstrual problems;
the tongue will be Pale and the pulse Choppy.
   Box 48.13 summarizes the eﬀects of diet.

          BOX 48.13         DIET - CHOICE OF FOODS
          • Too much cold food: injures Spleen and leads to Cold
          • Too much hot food: leads to Heat
          • Too much greasy food: leads to Dampness and Phlegm
          • Not eating enough: leads to Qi and Blood deficiency

     Eating habits
   Chinese medicine places stress not only on the range of foods eaten but also, and
as important as what foods we eat, on the way that we eat. We may eat a very
balanced diet with exclusively organic foods but if our eating habits are chaotic this
will lead to disease.
   Chinese medicine stresses the importance of routine and regularity in one's diet.
It also stresses the importance of having a short break after eating at lunchtime.
Unfortunately, most people who work full-time have very irregular eating habits,
which may include any of the following:
          • eating in a hurry
          • eating standing up
          • eating at one's desk while working
          • having business lunches
          • eating without routine (e.g. a very large business lunch one day,
      followed by skipping lunch the next)
          • eating late in the evening.
   Such eating habits injure Stomach-Qi initially and then Stomach-Yin. One of the
clearest signs of this, apart from digestive problems, is a tongue with a Stomach crack
or sca ered Stomach cracks and without coating.

     Climate
   Invasion of external pathogenic factors is an important cause of disease in Painful
Obstruction Syndrome (Bi ). The main external pathogenic factors are Wind,
Dampness and Cold. Once in the body, any of these pathogenic factors can turn into
or combine with Heat.

     Wind
   Wind is characterized by soreness and pain of muscles and joints, limitation of
movement, with the pain moving from joint to joint. In acute cases the pulse would
be Floating and slightly Rapid. An important characteristic of Wind is that the pain
moves from joint to joint on diﬀerent days and it may also come and go quickly.

     Dampness
   Dampness is characterized by pain, soreness and swelling in muscles and joints
with a feeling of heaviness and numbness of the limbs, the pain being fixed in one
place and aggravated by damp weather. In acute cases the pulse would be Slow and
slightly Slippery.

     Cold
   Cold is characterized by a severe pain in a joint or muscle with limitation of
movement, usually unilateral. In acute cases the pulse is Tight.

     Heat
   Heat originates from any of the previous three types when the exterior
pathogenic factor turns into Heat in the Interior and gives rise to Heat Painful
Obstruction Syndrome. This happens especially with an underlying deficiency of
Yin. Heat is characterized by pain and redness, swelling and heat in the joints (which
feel hot to the touch), limitation of movement and severe pain. In acute cases there is
thirst, a fever which does not abate after sweating and a Slippery and Rapid pulse.
This syndrome is characterized not just by Heat, but Damp-Heat. In fact, Dampness
is the primary aspect of this syndrome and Heat the secondary one.
   The diagnosis of external pathogenic factors is based on two main factors: the
acute onset of the problem and a sensitivity of pain to weather changes.
   Besides aﬀecting the joints, climatic pathogenic factors can also aﬀect the Internal
Organs directly. This happens when external Cold invades the Stomach (causing
acute epigastric pain and vomiting), the Intestines (causing acute abdominal pain
and diarrhoea) or the Uterus (causing acute dysmenorrhoea).
   Box 48.14 summarizes the climatic factors aﬀecting joints.

           BOX 48.14             CLIMATIC FACTORS AFFECTING
      JOINTS
          Wind: pain moving from joint to joint
          Cold: severe pain in one joint
          Dampness: dull ache and swelling of joints
          Damp-Heat: ache, swelling and redness of joints

     Trauma
   By ‘trauma' is meant physical trauma. Accidents cause local stagnation of Qi. If
the trauma is severe, it also causes local Blood stasis.
   The diagnosis of trauma is obvious from the history, except when the trauma
occurred several years before and the patient has either forgo en it or not related it to
the presenting problem.
   If the trauma causes local Blood stasis, this may manifest on the tongue with a
single purple spot which (when compared with points) is relatively large. The tongue
reflects also areas of the body and the location of the purple spot points to the site of
the trauma, which may also be very old (Fig. 48.3 ).
                               Right side                     Left side
                                of body                       of body

      FIG. 48.3   Body areas reflected on the tongue
   Thus, for example, a small purple spot on the right side of the tip may indicate a
trauma to the right side of the head.

     Drugs Including Immunizations
Medicinal drugs
   Obviously medicinal drugs are an important cause of disease in Western patients.
A discussion of the side-eﬀects of drugs is beyond the scope of this book. It should be
noted, however, that with few important exceptions (such as chemotherapy and
steroids), the side-eﬀects of drugs are relatively short lived (once they are stopped)
compared with other causes of disease. For example, an antidepressant will have
some well-known side-eﬀects but these will stop when the drug is discontinued and
will not cause lasting damage. It is diﬀerent with the other causes of disease such as
heredity, emotional stress or diet. For example, an emotional problem dating back to
a person's childhood will have long-lasting eﬀects even after the person has
recognized the problem and taken steps to face it and resolve it. Likewise, if a person
eats irregularly for some years, the eﬀects of this may be very long lasting even a
considerable time after the diet has been rectified.

     Immunizations
   Immunizations, in my opinion, lead to the formation of Latent Heat. Latent Heat
is formed when a pathogenic factor invades the body without causing apparent
symptoms; the pathogenic factor penetrates the Interior, turns into Heat and ‘lurks'
in the Interior for some time. After some time (usually weeks or months), the Heat
emerges in the form of Latent Heat with symptoms such as sudden weariness, tired
limbs, insomnia, thirst, irritability, Red tongue and Rapid pulse. It should be stressed
that the fact that the Latent Heat emerges does not mean that it is being expelled but
simply that it is manifesting after lurking in the Interior for some time.
   In order to understand the eﬀect of immunizations we need to refer to the theory
of the Four Levels. According to this theory, an external pathogenic factor invades
the body passing through four energetic levels: the Defensive-Qi, Qi, Nutritive-Qi
and Blood levels. (See Fig. 104.2 on p. 959 .)
   The Defensive-Qi level is an exterior level, that is, at this stage the pathogenic
factor is on the Exterior of the body. At the Qi level, the pathogenic factor turns into
interior Heat. The three levels, Qi, Nutritive-Qi and Blood, are all interior and all
characterized by interior Heat but at three diﬀerent energetic layers, Qi being the
most superficial and Blood the deepest. With an immunization, it is as if the
‘pathogenic factor' (i.e. the vaccine) were injected directly at the Blood level. Once
there, it ‘lurks', turns into Heat and emerges later as Latent Heat.
   It is of course impossible to prove, but my impression is that many modern
autoimmune diseases, some cancers (such as leukemia) and AIDS manifest as Latent
Heat and their growing incidence may partly be due to immunizations.

     Recreational drugs
   The ill-eﬀects of ‘recreational' drugs such as cocaine, heroin, LSD and Ecstasy are
well known. However, so-called ‘soft' drugs such as cannabis also have a profound
impact on our health. Regular smoking of cannabis over a long period has definite
neurological actions on the brain aﬀecting memory and concentration negatively. 18 It
is my experience that these eﬀects are permanent in long-term users even after they
stop using the drug. Long-term use of the drug may also cause loss of brain
substance; cannabis also impairs cell division by lymphocytes in tissue culture. 19
   In my experience, long-term users display a certain lack of centredness and a
weak Stomach and Spleen.

     Excessive Sexual Activity
   By ‘sexual activity' is meant ejaculation in men and orgasm in women. Excessive
sexual activity may weaken the Kidneys because sperm is a direct emanation of the
Kidney-Essence (sexual activity not culminating in ejaculation does not deplete the
Kidneys). It is diﬃcult to define what is ‘excessive' because it depends on the age and
health of the person. A very rough guide to the recommended frequency of
ejaculation in healthy men is to divide the man's age by five (e.g. every 8 days in a 40-
year-old man). It should be stressed that this period should be extended if the man is
in poor health and especially if he suﬀers from a Kidney deficiency.
   Excessive sexual activity weakens the Kidney-Essence and may cause backache,
dizziness, tinnitus, poor memory and concentration, and weak knees.
   I have so far referred to men deliberately because, in my opinion, the eﬀect of
sexual activity in women is quite diﬀerent from that in men. Sperm in men is an
emanation of the Kidney-Essence; the equivalent in women is menstrual blood.
Sperm and menstrual blood constitute the ‘Tian Gui ' essence which arrives at
puberty. Quite simply, men lose sperm during orgasm but women do not lose
menstrual blood; therefore, sexual activity and orgasm in women are not weakening
to the Kidneys. A cause of disease in women equivalent to excessive ejaculation in
men would be a heavy loss of blood after childbirth or a heavy monthly blood loss in
a woman suﬀering from menorrhagia. Some people say that the increased fluid
lubrication in the vagina during sexual arousal and orgasm is equivalent to
ejaculation in men. I tend to disagree with this view because, in my opinion, such
fluids are part of Body Fluids rather than an emanation of the Kidney-Essence.
   Finally, it should be mentioned that lack of sexual activity may also be a cause of
disease but only when sexual desire is present. If sexual desire is totally absent, then
lack of sexual activity has no health repercussions. Sexual desire makes the Minister
Fire rise upwards; with orgasm this Fire is discharged downwards. When sexual
desire is unfulfilled, the Minister Fire rises up without being discharged during
orgasm and it aﬀects the Heart, causing Heart-Fire or stagnation of Heart-Qi.
