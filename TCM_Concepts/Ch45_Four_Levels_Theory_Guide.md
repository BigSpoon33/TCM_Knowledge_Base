PART 6
45

The identification of patterns according to the Four 
Levels was devised by Ye Tian Shi in his book ‘A Discus-
sion on Warm Diseases’ (Wen Bing Lun, 1746). The 
identification of patterns according to the Four Levels 
is clinically the most useful tool to interpret the pathol-
ogy and establish the treatment of diseases deriving 
from invasion of Wind-Heat.

As mentioned in chapter 44, the identification of 
patterns according to the Six Stages, devised by Zhang 
Zhong Jing in his ‘Discussion of Cold-Induced Diseases’ 
(Shang Han Lun, ad 220), dominated the thinking on 
the pathology and treatment of diseases of external 
origin for 14 centuries. Although many patients clearly 
suffered from invasion of Wind-Heat during those cen-
turies and some dissenting voices had been heard 
during the Song and Ming dynasties, it was not until 
the late Ming and early Qing dynasty (1600s) that a 
comprehensive theory of diseases from external Wind-
Heat was formulated.

In particular, these doctors formulated the theory of 
‘Warm Diseases’ (Wen Bing) as a new, distinct disease 
category different from the diseases from external Wind 
falling under the umbrella of Shang Han diseases (i.e. 
diseases from invasion of Wind and Cold). As men-
tioned in the previous chapter, even Warm Diseases 
were explained as a transformation of Cold pathogen. 
The doctors who contributed to this theory were col-
lectively referred to as the ‘School of Warm Diseases’ 
and the most influential of these were Wu You Ke 
(1582–1652), author of ‘Discussion on Warm Epidem-
ics’ (Wen Yi Lun), Ye Tian Shi (1677–1746), author of 
‘Discussion on Warm Diseases’ (Wen Bing Lun), and Wu 
Ju Tong (1758–1836), author of ‘Systematic Differen-
tiation of Warm Diseases’ (Wen Bing Tiao Bian). Ye Tian 
Shi formulated the identification of patterns according 
to the Four Levels while Wu Ju Tong formulated the 
identification of patterns according to the Three 
Burners. Incidentally, Wu Ju Tong formulated the 
widely used formula for the beginning stage of invasion 
of Wind-Heat, Yin Qiao San Forsythia-Lonicera Powder.

Nature of Warm Diseases

The theory of Warm Diseases represented an impor-
tant, revolutionary departure in Chinese medicine. All 
Warm Diseases are by definition caused by external 
Wind-Heat but they have special characteristics which 
can be summarized as follows:

•	 They all manifest with fever
•	 The pathogenic factor enters through the nose and mouth
•	 They are infectious
•	 The pathological developments are rapid
•	 The pathogenic factor of Warm Diseases has a strong

tendency to injure Yin

The second and third characteristics are particularly 
important and new in Chinese medicine. Until the 
development of the Warm Diseases School, external 
pathogenic factors were thought to enter the body 
through the skin, hence the rationale in sweating as a 
treatment method in the beginning stages; the Warm 
Diseases School believes that pathogenic factors enter 
through the nose and mouth. This is a very perceptive 
view that accords with that of Western medicine as the 
bacteria and viruses causing Warm Diseases enter via 
the mucous membranes of nose and mouth.

Even more important was the discovery of the infec-
tious nature of such diseases. This concept, formulated 
before the introduction of Western medicine to China, 
was revolutionary as previously it was thought that 
the factors determining why a person succumbs to 
invasions of external pathogenic factors were to be 
found in the relative imbalance between the external 
pathogenic factor and the body’s Qi. Although such 
imbalance still plays a role in the development of Warm 
Diseases, the Warm Diseases School recognized that 
some of the pathogenic factors causing Warm Diseases 
can be very strong, indeed ‘virulent’ to use a Western 
medical expression, and many people will succumb to 
them even though their body’s Qi may be relatively 
strong. Moreover, the doctors of the School of Warm 
Diseases recognized the sometimes epidemic nature of 
some of these diseases and clearly saw that, on occa-
sions, whole villages or even whole counties would be 
decimated by an epidemic of an infectious disease.

a Warm Disease. By nature, Warm Diseases are more 
virulent, more infectious, they are characterized by 
more intense Heat, they develop rapidly and they have 
a strong tendency to injure Yin.

Examples of ‘Warm Diseases’ are influenza, measles 
(rubeola), German measles (rubella), chicken pox (vari-
cella), mononucleosis (glandular fever), mumps (paro-
titis), SARS, meningitis, encephalitis, whooping cough 
(pertussis) and scarlet fever (scarlatina).

Examples of ‘warm diseases’ are influenza, measles (rubeola), 
German measles (rubella), chicken pox (varicella), glandular

(scarlatina)

The Four Levels

The interpretation of clinical manifestations of Warm 
Diseases according to the Four Levels was formulated 
by Ye Tian Shi. This is a brilliant theory that provides 
the most clinically useful tool to diagnose, interpret 
and treat diseases caused by external Wind-Heat and 
their consequences, whether they are Warm Diseases 
or not.

The theory of the Four Levels is clinically more rel-
evant than that of the Six Stages. For example, one of 
the most common consequences of an invasion of 
Wind-Heat is the transformation of external Wind-
Heat into interior Phlegm-Heat in the Lungs, causing 
a chest infection: this situation is contemplated in the 
Four Levels (corresponding to Lung-Heat, Qi level), 
while it is not contemplated in the Six Stages.

The Qi level contemplates the pattern of Damp-Heat 
in Stomach and Spleen as a consequence of an inva-
sion of Wind-Heat: this is a very common clinical situ-
ation and yet it is one that is not contemplated in the 
Six Stages.

The Blood level includes patterns which are charac-
terized by convulsions from the development of inter-
nal Wind: these are typical complications of children’s

diseases such as meningitis but they are not contem-
plated in the Six Stages.

The Four Levels are the Defensive Qi, Qi, Nutritive Qi 
and Blood levels (Wei, Qi, Ying, Xue): the first level is 
the only exterior one characterized by the presence of 
the external Wind-Heat on the energetic surface of the 
body. The other three levels are all interior and all char-
acterized by interior Heat; however, the brilliance of 
this theory lies in its identification of three different 
depths of penetration of interior pathogenic Heat. 
Each level has its own distinctive pathology and treat-
ment (Fig. 45.1).

Before listing the clinical manifestations of each 
pattern, I will first discuss the Four Levels in general.

The three levels Qi, Nutritive Qi and Blood (Qi, Ying and Xue) 
are all interior and all characterized by interior Heat but with a 
difference in energetic depth

Defensive Qi level (Wei)

The Defensive Qi level is the beginning stage of inva-
sions of Wind-Heat: it is the only exterior level (i.e. 
characterized by the presence of the exterior Wind on 
the Exterior of the body). The Defensive Qi level com-
prises four different patterns according to the nature of 
the pathogenic factor: namely, Wind-Heat, Summer-
Heat, Damp-Heat and Dry-Heat. Of these four, Wind-
Heat is by far the most common one.

Qi level (Qi)

The Qi level is interior, that is, the pathogenic factor has 
penetrated into the Interior and it has also transformed 
into Heat. However, the Qi level is the most superficial 
of the three interior levels. There is a saying about the 
Qi level stating ‘Nobody dies at the Qi level’: this means 
that, in the context of acute febrile diseases, contrary 
to the Nutritive Qi and Blood levels, the Qi level is never 
life-threatening.

The Qi level is characterized by Full Interior Heat 
with symptoms of fever, thirst, feeling of heat, mental 
restlessness, Red tongue with thick yellow coating and 
a Rapid-Full pulse. These are just general symptoms as 
other manifestations depend on the pattern involved, 
of which there are five: Lung-Heat (Heat in chest and 
diaphragm), Stomach-Heat, Intestines Dry-Heat, Gall 
Bladder-Heat and Damp-Heat in Stomach and Spleen.

With the Qi level, there are actually two types of 
Heat, one that I call ‘Heat’ and the other ‘Fire’. The 
pattern of Intestines Dry-Heat is characterized by Fire 
while the other four are characterized by Heat. Fire has 
the same nature as Heat but, compared to it, has the 
following distinguishing features:

•	 It is more intense (intense thirst, high fever, intense feeling

of heat)
•	 It affects the Mind more (mental restlessness, delirium)
•	 It dries up more (intense thirst, dry stools, constipation, very

dry tongue coating)
•	 It is at a deeper energetic layer that Heat (Deep pulse

compared to Overflowing in Heat)
•	 It may cause bleeding
•	 In acute febrile diseases in children it may cause internal

Wind quickly

The pattern of Stomach-Heat represents Heat in the 
Stomach (and it is equivalent to the Bright Yang 
channel pattern within the Six Stages), while that of 
Intestines Dry-Heat represents Fire (and it is equivalent 
to the Bright Yang organ pattern).

Table 45.1 compares the Defensive Qi and Qi levels 
while Table 45.2 compares Heat and Fire within the  
Qi level.

Nutritive Qi level (Ying)

At the Nutritive Qi level, the Heat has penetrated to a 
deeper energetic layer and begun to injure the Yin. At 
this level, Heat is obstructing the Mind and the

The tongue appearance at the Nutritive Qi level is an 
important sign that differentiates this level from the Qi 
level: at the Nutritive Qi level, the tongue is Deep-Red 
without coating (while at the Qi level, it is Red with a 
thick coating).

There are two patterns at the Nutritive Qi level: Heat 
in Nutritive Qi level and Heat in the Pericardium.

Blood level (Xue)

The Blood level is the deepest energetic layer, with  
Heat affecting the Blood. There are several different 
patterns with varying clinical manifestations but the 
chief clinical features of the Blood level are as follows:

•	 Heat is affecting the Mind, causing delirium or coma
•	 Heat in the Blood causes bleeding under the skin with the

appearance of macules
•	 Internal Wind develops, causing convulsions and tremors
•	 Collapse of Yin or Yang may occur

Macules are a definite sign that Heat has reached the 
Blood level. There are five patterns at the Blood level: 
Heat victorious moving Blood, Heat victorious stirring 
Wind, Empty-Wind agitating in the Interior, Collapse 
of Yin and Collapse of Yang.

Pathology

The pathology of aversion to cold and ‘fever’ is the 
same as for the Greater Yang stage already discussed in 
chapter 44. Please note that, contrary to what one 
might think, there is aversion to cold in invasions of 
Wind-Heat because the Wind (whether it is with Cold 
or Heat) obstructs the Defensive Qi in the space between 
the skin and muscles so that it cannot warm the body.

In the case of ordinary invasions of Wind-Heat, 
‘fever’ may not be an actual fever but an objective  
hot feeling of the patient’s body on palpation; however, 
in the case of Warm Diseases, it would be an actual 
fever.

The headache is caused by the obstruction of the 
channels of the head by exterior Wind in the same way 
as for the Greater Yang stage. The body aches, which 
may be very pronounced, are caused by the obstruc-
tion of the muscles by exterior Wind. The tongue 
coating is white because the pathogenic factor is on the 
Exterior.

A sore throat is due to invasion of the Wind in the 
Lung channel in the throat: a sore and red throat is a 
distinctive sign of invasion of Wind-Heat as compared 
to Wind-Cold.

Treatment

Treatment principle: release the Exterior, expel Wind-

Heat, restore the diffusing and descending of 
Lung-Qi.

### RIGHT COLUMN

Wind-Cold (Six Stages)

Slight sweating

Summer-Heat

Clinical manifestations

Identification of Patterns According to the Four Levels

Fever, aversion to cold, sweating, headache, a feeling 
of heaviness, an uncomfortable sensation in the epi-
gastrium, irritability, thirst, tongue Red in the front or 
sides with a white sticky coating, Soggy and Rapid 
pulse.

Pathology

Summer-Heat is a seasonal pathogenic factor: that is, 
it occurs only in the Summer (while Wind-Heat may 
occur at any time of year). Summer-Heat invades the 
Defensive Qi portion of the body (i.e. the Exterior) and 
that is why there is aversion to cold. However, it has the 
strong tendency to move to the Qi level almost from the 
beginning and that is why there are symptoms of inte-
rior Heat such as irritability, thirst, Red tongue and 
Rapid pulse.

Summer-Heat frequently combines with Dampness 
and that is why there is a feeling of heaviness and 
uncomfortable sensation of the epigastrium, a sticky 
tongue coating and a Soggy pulse. The tongue  
coating is white because the pathogenic factor is on  
the Exterior.

Clinical manifestations

Fever that is worse in the afternoon, body hot to touch, 
aversion to cold, swollen glands, headache, a feeling of 
heaviness, a feeling of oppression of the epigastrium, 
sticky taste, thirst with no desire to drink, sticky white 
tongue coating, Soggy pulse.

Pathology

This is Damp-Heat at the Defensive Qi level when 
Dampness is on the Exterior: for this reason, there is 
aversion to cold. However, Damp-Heat has a stronger 
tendency to affect the Qi level than Wind-Heat does. 
Dampness obstructs the Middle Burner and this causes 
the feeling of oppression of the epigastrium; as it 
obstructs the muscles, it causes the typical feeling of

772


### RIGHT COLUMN

heaviness. A sticky taste without desire to drink is 
typical of Damp-Heat: Heat causes the thirst but as 
Dampness obstructs the Middle Burner, the person 
does not feel like drinking. The swollen glands reflect 
Dampness and are an important distinctive sign for this 
pattern.

The headache is usually frontal and is due to Damp-
ness in the Stomach channel of the face. The tongue 
coating is white because the pathogenic factor is on the 
Exterior.

Treatment principle: release the Exterior, resolve

Clinical manifestations

High fever, feeling of heat, no aversion to cold, thirst,

Pathology

This is interior Heat at the Qi level in the Lungs. As in 
all patterns of the Qi level there is fever, a feeling of 
heat, thirst and sweating.

The descending of Lung-Qi is impaired by the Heat 
and this causes the cough and shortness of breath.

Clinical manifestations

Alternating hot and cold feeling with a prevalence of 
heat, bitter taste, thirst, dry throat, hypochondrial 
pain, nausea, a feeling of fullness in the epigastrium, 
Red tongue with unilateral sticky yellow coating, Wiry-
Rapid pulse.

Pathology

This is equivalent to the Lesser Yang pattern of the Six 
Stages: it occurs when the pathogenic factor oscillates 
between the Exterior (causing feeling of cold) and the 
Interior (causing feeling of heat). The main difference 
between Gall Bladder-Heat of the Four Levels and  
the Lesser Yang pattern of the Six Stages is that the 
former is characterized by more Heat and also by some 
Dampness (hence the sticky tongue coating).

Damp-Heat in Stomach and Spleen

Clinical manifestations

Continuous fever which decreases after sweating but 
soon increases again, a feeling of heaviness of the body 
and head, a feeling of oppression of the chest and epi-
gastrium, nausea, loose stools, Red tongue with sticky 
yellow tongue coating, Soggy-Rapid pulse.

Pathology

This is Damp-Heat in the Stomach and Spleen at the Qi 
level. Dampness obstructs the Middle Burner and this 
causes a feeling of oppression of the chest and epigas-
trium and nausea. Dampness impairs the Spleen’s 
transformation and transportation, which causes loose 
stools. The feeling of heaviness is caused by the obstruc-
tion of the muscles by Dampness.

Damp-Heat causes sweating but this does not reduce 
the fever because sweat comes from the space between 
skin and muscles and the Dampness is situation in the 
Interior.

Heat in Nutritive Qi level

Clinical manifestations

Fever at night, dry mouth with no desire to drink, 
mental restlessness, insomnia, delirium, incoherent 
speech or aphasia, macules, Red tongue without 
coating, Fine-Rapid pulse.

Pathology

At the Nutritive Qi level, Heat affects the Mind and this 
causes the mental restlessness, delirium and insomnia. 
Fever at night reflects the penetration of Heat at the 
Nutritive Qi level.

Heat in the Nutritive Qi level may heat the Blood and 
cause macules. At this level, Heat has injured Yin and 
this causes the tongue to have no coating and its 
redness reflects the Heat.

Clinical manifestations

Pathology

The pathology of this pattern is essentially the same as 
the previous one except that there are more mental 
signs from invasion of the Pericardium by Heat. The 
cold hands and feet are a sign of False Cold and they 
are due to the Heat being so intense that it stops the

Clinical manifestations

High fever, mental restlessness, manic behaviour, dark

Wiry-Rapid pulse.

Pathology

Heat has entered the Blood level and it heats the  
Blood, causing it to spill out of the blood vessels: this 
causes bleeding at various sites including under  
the skin (macules). Although macules can appear at 
the Nutritive Qi level, they are more typical of the Blood 
level.

Heat in the Blood disturbs the mind and causes 
mental restlessness and manic behaviour.

LATENT HEAT

The concept of Latent Heat is very old in Chinese medi-
cine, having been mentioned for the first time in the 
‘Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine’. Latent 
Heat occurs when an external pathogenic factor pen-
etrates the body without causing apparent symptoms 
at the time; the pathogenic factor penetrates into the 
Interior, and ‘incubates’ there, turning into interior 
Heat. This Heat later emerges with acute symptoms of 
Heat: when it emerges, it is called Latent Heat.

The reason that an external pathogenic factor 
invades the body without acute symptoms is usually to 
be found in a Kidney deficiency: thus, the development 
of Latent Heat indicates a pre-existing Kidney defi-
ciency, which induces a weakened immune response to 
the invasion of an external pathogenic factor.

The main clinical manifestations of the emergence 
of Latent Heat are:

•	 Acute onset
•	 Thirst
•	 Irritability
•	 Insomnia
•	 Sudden tiredness and lassitude
•	 Weary limbs
•	 Dark urine
•	 Red tongue
•	 Rapid pulse

Other symptoms and signs vary according to the 
type of Latent Heat and these are described below. 
Please note that the fact that Latent Heat ‘emerges’ 
after a period of incubation does not mean that it is 
being ‘expelled’ by the body, merely that it is moving 
outwards and manifesting itself.

Figure 45.5 illustrates the concept of Latent Heat 
from the ‘Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medi-
cine’ and Figure 45.6 compares and contrasts the 
pathology of invasion of Wind-Heat with that of Latent 
Heat. Figures 45.7, 45.8 and 45.9 illustrate the types 
of Latent Heat and patterns developing from it.

Table 45.7 compares the clinical manifestations of 
Wind-Heat and Latent Heat.

Latent Heat can manifest at the Qi or Blood level. 
There are three main patterns, two at the Qi level and 
one at the Blood level, as follows:

•	 Qi level

•	 Lesser Yang type
•	 Bright Yang type
•	 Blood level

•	 Lesser Yin type

Latent Heat Lesser Yang type

Alternation of chills and fever, bitter taste, hypochon-
drial pain, red eyes, deafness, vomiting, a feeling of 
oppression of the diaphragm, Red tongue with unilat-
eral yellow coating, Wiry pulse.

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN  
THE FOUR LEVELS, SIX STAGES  
AND THREE BURNERS

Although the identification of patterns according to 
the Six Stages dates back to the Han dynasty and those

Pulse

according to the Four Levels and Three Burners to the 
Qing dynasty, there are many points of contact between 
the three. First of all, all three of them describe the 
symptoms of invasion of external Wind when this is on 
the Exterior in the beginning stages and when it is in 
the Interior in later stages.

Identification of Patterns According to the Four Levels

The Greater Yang stage of the Six Stages is similar to 
the Defensive Qi level within the Four Levels as they 
both deal with invasions of external Wind, the former 
Wind-Cold and the latter Wind-Heat.

The two patterns ‘Bright Yang channel pattern’ and 
‘Bright Yang organ pattern’ of the Bright Yang stage  
of the Six Stages are practically the same as the pat-
terns ‘Heat in Bright Yang’ and ‘Dry Heat in the 
Stomach and Intestines’ patterns of the Qi level of the 
Four Levels: indeed the same herbal formulas are appli-
cable. The Lesser Yang stage of the Six Stages is  
almost the same as the Gall Bladder-Heat of the Qi 
level, the former being characterized by the predomi-
nance of Cold and the latter by that of Heat with some 
Dampness.

The identification of patterns according to the Three 
Burners is quite similar to that according to the Four 
Levels. Many of the patterns are essentially the same 
as those of the Four Levels, except that they are seen

from the perspective of the Three Burners: that is, pat-
