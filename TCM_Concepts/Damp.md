# ðŸ§¬ Damp

## ðŸ“– Definition

Damp is the predominant qi of late summer, a hot and rainy season in China. It can cause various diseases and is characterized by heaviness, turbidity, viscosity, and stagnation.

---

## ðŸ”¬ Key Characteristics

### 1. Heaviness and turbidity

Damp is characterized by heaviness and turbidity.

**Clinical Significance:** Dizziness, a heavy sensation in the head as though it had been wrapped in a piece of cloth, heaviness of the body as though it were carrying a heavy load, and soreness, pain and heavy sensations in the joints. Turbid discharges from the body, such as suppurating sores, weeping eczema, profuse purulent leukorrhoea with a foul odour, turbid urine and stools containing mucus and even blood.

### 2. Viscosity and stagnation

Damp is characterized by viscosity and stagnation.

**Clinical Significance:** A stubborn sticky tongue coating, a viscous stool that is difficult to excrete, and obstructed urination. Diseases due to pathogenic damp tend to be prolonged and intractable, such as fixed bi.

### 3. Yin pathogenic factor impairing Yang and obstructing qi circulation

Damp is a yin pathogenic factor which impairs yang and easily obstructs qi circulation.

**Clinical Significance:** A full sensation in the chest, epigastric distention, difficult and scanty urination and hesitant bowel movements with viscous stools.

### 4. Impairs Spleen Yang

Pathogenic damp is likely to impair spleen yang because the spleen "likes dryness and dislikes damp."

**Clinical Significance:** Distention and fullness in the epigastrium and abdomen, poor appetite, loose stools, reduced urination and oedema, due to poor transportation and transformation and inadequate dispersion of body fluids.
