Identification of Patterns 
According to Pathogenic Factors

Pathogenic factors invade the body in various forms: 
these are Wind, Cold, Dampness, Heat, Dryness and 
Fire. Each of these can be of exterior or interior origin. 
They always correspond to a Full pattern according to 
the Eight Principles. Indeed, from the Eight-Principle 
point of view, a Full condition is defined as one char-
acterized by the presence of a pathogenic factor while 
the body’s Qi is still relatively intact.

Of course, a pathogenic factor is frequently associ-
ated with a Deficiency, in which case the condition  
is a combined Full–Empty condition. With regard to 
pathogenic factors, a combined Full–Empty condition 
can arise in one of two ways: a pathogenic factor can 
give rise to a Deficiency (e.g. Fire weakens Yin) or a 
Deficiency can give rise to a pathogenic factor (e.g. 
Spleen-Qi deficiency gives rise to Dampness).

Generally speaking, pathogenic factors are more rel-
evant as patterns of disharmony than as causes of 
disease. In chapter 21 they were discussed as causes of 
disease in relation to climate; we will now discuss them 
simply as patterns of disease, irrespective of climatic 
influences.

As was explained previously, the diagnosis of a path-
ogenic factor is made not on the basis of the patient’s 
history, but on the basis of the pattern of symptoms 
and signs presented. Of course, when considered as 
causes of disease, climatic factors have a definite, direct 
influence on the body and they attack it in a way that 
corresponds to their nature. For example, a person 
exposed to a hot, dry climate is likely to develop a 
pattern of invasion of ‘Wind-Dryness’. However, when 
considered as pathogenic factors, climatic influences 
are somewhat irrelevant as the diagnosis is made only 
on the basis of the clinical manifestations. For example, 
if a person has a runny nose, aversion to cold, sneez-
ing, a headache, a stiff neck, a cough and a Floating 
pulse, these clinical manifestations denote a pattern of 
exterior Wind-Cold. It is irrelevant whether this person

was exposed to climatic cold or not and it is not usually 
necessary to ask.

If a patient displays all the symptoms of a particular climatic 
pathogenic factor (e.g. Wind-Cold), we can diagnose such a 
pathogenic factor without reference to exposure to that 
climate (e.g. we do not need to ask whether patient was 
exposed to wind and cold).

Some internally generated pathogenic factors give 
rise to similar pathological signs and symptoms as  
the exterior climatic factors. These will be discussed 
together with the relevant exterior pathogenic factor.

The pathogenic factors are:

• Wind
• Cold
• Summer-Heat
• Dampness
• Dryness
• Fire

Wind, Summer-Heat, Dryness and Fire are Yang 
pathogenic factors, which therefore tend to injure Yin. 
Cold and Dampness are Yin pathogenic factors, which 
therefore tend to injure Yang. Please note that Damp-
ness is a Yin pathogenic factor even though it may be 
combined with Heat. Even in such cases, Dampness is 
obstructive of Yang.

Wind, Cold, Summer-Heat, Dampness and Dryness 
are seasonal, with the following relationships (the rel-
evant affected organs are in parentheses):

Wind = Spring (Liver)
Cold = Winter (Kidneys)
Summer-Heat = Summer (Heart)
Dampness = Late Summer (Spleen)
Dryness = Autumn (Lungs)



============================================================
[Page 754]

### LEFT COLUMN

Fire does not have a seasonal association. Of course, 
the relationship of a particular pathogenic factor with 
a specific season should not be interpreted too rigidly 
as each pathogenic factor, though more prevalent in its 
relevant season, can occur in any season. Summer-
Heat is the only pathogenic factor that is strictly sea-
sonal, i.e. it can occur only in the Summer. Also, 
Summer-Heat is the only pathogenic factor that can be 
only external: in contrast, all other pathogenic factors 
can be either externally or internally generated.

Generally Chinese books include also Phlegm and 
Blood stasis as pathogenic factors. This is because, 
although Phlegm and Blood stasis are themselves the 
result of a disharmony, in chronic conditions they 
become the cause of further disharmonies and there-
fore behave as pathogenic factors. Phlegm and Blood 
stasis are discussed in chapter 31.

genic factors will be structured under the following

WIND

Wind is Yang in nature and tends to injure Blood and 
Yin. Wind is often the vehicle through which other 
climatic factors invade the body. For example, Cold will 
often enter the body as Wind-Cold and Heat as 
Wind-Heat.

The clinical manifestations due to Wind mimic the 
action of wind itself in Nature: the wind arises quickly 
and changes rapidly, it moves swiftly, blows intermit-
tently and sways the top of trees. Just as wind in Nature 
sways the top of trees, Wind causes involuntary move-
ments in the form of tremors or convulsions.

However, Wind can also cause the opposite: that is, 
paralysis and rigidity. There is a saying that captures 
this clinical characteristic of Wind: ‘Sudden rigidity is 
due to Wind.’1 This refers to the clinical manifestations 
resulting from both interior and exterior Wind. In fact, 
interior Wind can cause paralysis (as in Wind-stroke) 
and exterior Wind can cause facial paralysis or simply 
stiffness of the neck.

The main clinical manifestations of Wind are:

• Its onset is rapid
• It causes rapid changes in symptoms and signs
• It causes symptoms and signs to move from place to place

in the body
• It can cause tremors, convulsions, but also stiffness or

paralysis
• It causes numbness and/or tingling
• It affects the top part of the body
• It affects the Lungs first (external Wind)
• It affects the Liver (internal Wind)
• It affects the skin
• It causes itching

These characteristics will be expanded on below.

Wind has a rapid onset

Wind, both exterior and interior, has a rapid onset. For 
example, an invasion of exterior Wind resulting in a 
common cold arises quite suddenly; the invasion of 
Wind in the muscles of the neck results in a stiff neck 
from one day to the next; Wind-stroke (caused by inter-
nal Wind) has a sudden onset.

Wind causes rapid changes

External Wind-Cold may produce quite rapid changes 
in symptoms from one day to the next or even within 
a day: this is especially common in children. Another

good example of rapid clinical changes are those occur-
ring in skin diseases from Wind.

Wind causes manifestations to move 
from place to place

The best example of this is the movement of pain from 
one joint to the other in Wind Painful Obstruction Syn-
drome (Bi Syndrome).

Wind causes convulsions, tremors  
but also paralysis or stiffness

Wind can produce two opposite manifestations, either 
involuntary movements, such as tremors, or the lack 
of movement, for example paralysis or stiffness. All 
involuntary movements, such as the tremors of Par-
kinson’s disease, tics or convulsions during a febrile 
disease, are due to internal Wind ‘shaking the sinews’.

Wind contracts and can cause the opposite: that is, 
lack of movement, such as in rigidity, stiffness, paraly-
sis from Wind-stroke or facial paralysis.

Wind causes numbness and/or tingling

Wind often causes numbness and/or tingling, espe-
cially unilateral. For example, unilateral numbness of 
the first three fingers of the hand may herald Wind-
stroke. Numbness of the face may be due to invasion 
of external Wind in the Connecting (Luo) channels of 
the face.

Identification of Patterns According to Pathogenic Factors

Wind affects the top part of the body

External Wind invading the channels and joints and 
causing Wind Painful Obstruction Syndrome will typi-
cally affect the top part of the body: for example, the 
neck and shoulders.

Internal Wind may cause headache and vertigo. Skin 
diseases from Wind will affect the head and hands 
primarily.

Wind affects the Lungs first  
(external Wind)

External Wind invading the Exterior of the body affects 
the Lung’s Defensive Qi portion first.

Wind affects the Liver (internal Wind)

Internal Wind always involves a Liver pathology. The 
symptoms of Wind, such as vertigo, are due to the 
rising of Liver-Qi to the top of the body. Tremors and

727

### LEFT COLUMN

convulsions are due to the ‘shaking of sinews’, which 
are controlled by the Liver.

Wind affects the skin

Wind can cause a large number of skin diseases  
characterized by generalized itching, affliction of the 
top of the body, skin rashes with sudden onset and 
development.

Wind causes itching

External Wind invasion can cause an itchy throat. 
Wind in skin diseases is typically characterized by 
intense itching. Liver-Blood deficiency may give rise to 
Wind in the skin, causing itching: this is seen, for 
example, in itching in menopausal women.

All the above manifestations apply to both exterior 
and interior Wind, except for tremors, convulsions and 
paralysis, which apply only to interior Wind, and the 
affliction of the Lungs first, which applies only to exter-
nal Wind. Only facial paralysis (Bell’s palsy) can be 
caused by exterior Wind.

The subject of Wind will be discussed under the fol-
lowing headings:

WIND

• External Wind

• Invasion of Wind in the Lung’s Defensive Qi portion

(Painful Obstruction Syndrome)
• Affliction of the Liver channel by external Wind
• Wind in the skin
• Internal Wind

External Wind

External Wind invades the Lung’s Defensive Qi portion 
(the ‘Exterior’ of the body), causing exterior symptoms 
such as aversion to cold, fever, occipital stiffness and 
headache and a Floating pulse. External Wind may be 
combined with Cold, Heat, Dampness, Dryness and 
Water.

Exterior Wind can also invade the channels of the 
face directly and cause deviation of mouth and eye-
brows (facial paralysis).

728


### RIGHT COLUMN

Exterior Wind can also invade any channel, particu-
larly the Yang channels, and settle in the joints, causing 
stiffness and pain of the joints (Painful Obstruction 
Syndrome). The pain would typically be ‘wandering’, 
moving from one joint to another on different days.

Finally, Wind can also affect some Internal Organs, 
principally the Liver. Wind pertains to Wood and the 
Liver according to the Five-Element system of corre-
spondences. This relationship can often be observed 
when a person prone to migraine headaches is affected 
by a period of windy weather (particularly an easterly 
wind) causing a neck ache and headache (Fig. 43.1).

I shall discuss five different types of invasions of 
external Wind:

• Invasion of Wind in the Lung’s Defensive Qi portion

(common cold)
• Invasion of Wind in the channels of the face (facial paralysis)
• Invasion of Wind in the channels and joints (Painful

Obstruction Syndrome)
• Affliction of the Liver channel by external Wind
• Wind in the skin

Invasion of Wind in the Lung’s  
Defensive Qi portion

Exterior Wind penetrates via the skin and interferes 
with the circulation of Defensive Qi in the space 
between skin and muscles. Since Defensive Qi warms 
the muscles, when its circulation is impaired by Wind, 
the person feels chilly and has aversion to cold. ‘Aver-
sion to cold or wind’ is a characteristic and essential 
symptom of invasion of exterior Wind and consists not 
only of feeling cold and shivering but also of a reluc-
tance to go outside in the cold.

The Lungs control the spreading of Defensive Qi (Wei 
Qi) in the Exterior of the body and also the opening and 
closing of the pores. The presence of Wind in the space 
between skin and muscles interferes with the diffusing 
and descending of Lung-Qi and causes sneezing and 
possibly coughing. The impairment of the diffusing 
and descending of Lung-Qi prevents the spreading and 
descending of Lung fluids, resulting in a runny nose 
with profuse white discharge.

The fight between the pathogenic Wind and Defen-
sive Qi in the skin and muscles may cause a ‘fever’  
that is not necessarily an actual fever but rather an 
objective hot feeling of the patient’s body on palpation. 
Wind attacks the most superficial channels first, which 
are the Greater Yang channels (Small Intestine and

Bladder), and obstructs the circulation of Defensive Qi 
within them: this causes stiffness and pain along these 
channels and particularly in the back of the neck.

Wind attacks the top part of the body and often 
lodges in the throat, causing an itchy sensation in the 
throat.

If Wind combines with Cold with a prevalence of the 
latter, there will be no sweating because Cold contracts 
the pores. The pulse will be Tight: this corresponds to 
attack of Cold of the Greater Yang stage within the Six 
Stages (ch. 44). This is more likely to happen when a 
person has a relatively strong constitution and a ten-
dency to Excess patterns: then the body’s Defensive Qi 
reacts strongly, the pores will be closed and there will 
be no sweating. This is an Exterior-Full pattern.

If the Cold is not so prevalent but Wind predomi-
nates, the pores are open, the person sweats slightly 
and the pulse will be slow: this corresponds to the 
attack of Wind pattern of the Greater Yang stage 
within the Six Stages (ch. 44). This is more likely to 
happen to a person with a relatively weak constitution 
and a tendency to Deficiency patterns: then the Nutri-
tive Qi (Ying Qi) is weak, the pores are open and there

will be a slight sweating. This is an Exterior-Empty 
pattern. Please note that although Chinese books 
describe this pattern as ‘Exterior-Empty’, they do so 
only in relation to the invasion of Wind-Cold with the 
prevalence of Cold that is described as ‘Exterior-Full’. 
But both these patterns are Full patterns from the point 
of view of the Eight Principles as they are character-
ized by the presence of a pathogenic factor (Wind).

Identification of Patterns According to Pathogenic Factors

With the invasion of exterior Wind, Defensive Qi 
reacts by rushing to the Exterior of the body, and this 
is reflected on the pulse, which becomes more superfi-
cial (Floating pulse).

Thus, to summarize, the symptoms and signs of 
invasion of exterior Wind are:

• Aversion to cold or wind
• Sneezing, cough
• Runny nose
• ‘Fever’

beginning stages as the pathogenic factor is on the 
Exterior.
External Wind combines with other pathogenic 
factors and primarily Cold, Heat, Dampness and Water. 
Therefore, I will outline the clinical manifestation of 
five types of exterior Wind:

### LEFT COLUMN

• Wind-Cold
• Wind-Heat
• Wind-Dampness
• Wind-Dryness
• Wind-Water

Wind-Cold

Aversion to cold, sneezing, cough, runny nose with 
white watery mucus, fever, severe occipital stiffness 
and ache, no sweating, no thirst, Floating-Tight pulse, 
tongue body colour unchanged, thin white coating.

Explanation

The pathology of invasion of Wind-Cold has already 
been explained above.

Clinical note

L.I.-4 Hegu, LU-7 Lieque and BL-12 Fengmen (with cupping) are 
the main points to expel Wind-Cold

IDENTIFICATION OF PATTERNS

Wind-Heat

Aversion to cold, fever, sneezing, cough, runny nose 
with slightly yellow mucus, occipital stiffness and ache, 
slight sweating, itchy throat, sore throat, swollen 
tonsils, thirst, Floating-Rapid pulse, Tongue body 
colour Red on the tip or sides, thin white coating.

Explanation

The pathology here is the same as in Wind-Cold, except 
that since Wind is combined with Heat, there are some 
Heat signs, such as thirst, yellow mucus, more fever, a 
rapid pulse and a slightly Red tongue body on the tip 
or sides.

There is aversion to cold in invasions of Wind-Heat 
because this interferes with the circulation of Defen-
sive Qi in skin and muscles. Since Defensive Qi warms 
the muscles, an impairment of its circulation leads to 
aversion to cold in the beginning stages.

The tongue body is Red on the tip or sides because 
these areas reflect the Exterior of the body, as opposed 
to the centre of the tongue, which reflects the state  
of the Interior. The tongue coating is white in the

Wind-Dampness

Aversion to cold, fever, swollen neck glands, nausea, 
sweating, occipital stiffness, body aches, muscle ache, 
feeling of heaviness of the body, swollen joints, 
Floating-Slippery pulse.

Explanation

This consists in invasion of exterior Wind and Damp-
ness at the beginning stages. Dampness has an obstruc-
tive quality: when it obstructs the Connecting channels, 
it causes swollen glands in the neck; when it obstructs 
the muscles, it causes muscle ache and feeling of heavi-
ness of the body; when it obstructs the joints, it causes 
joint ache.

Clinical note

L.I.-4 Hegu, LU-7 Lieque, BL-13 Feishu and Ren-9 Shuifen are 
the main points to expel Wind-Dampness

Wind-Dryness

Fever, slight aversion to cold, slight sweating, dry skin, 
nose, mouth and throat, dry cough, sore throat, dry 
tongue with thin white coating, Floating-Rapid pulse.

Explanation

This is Wind-Heat with Dryness at the Defensive Qi 
level and, for this reason, there is aversion to cold. 
Other symptoms are due to Dryness injuring Body 
Fluids.

The tongue coating is white because the pathogenic 
factor is on the Exterior.

(with cupping) are the main points to expel Wind-Dryness

### LEFT COLUMN

Wind-Water

Aversion to cold, fever, oedema, especially on the face, 
swollen face and eyes, cough with profuse white and 
watery mucus, sweating, no thirst, Floating pulse.

Explanation

In this case, exterior Wind prevents the Lungs from 
opening the Water passages and diffusing and descend-
ing of fluids. Fluids cannot descend, so they overflow 
under the skin, causing oedema. This would be more 
prominent in the face as it is caused by a Lung dysfunc-
tion which mostly affects the Upper Burner.

The facial oedema that occurs in the beginning stage 
of acute nephritis would be considered ‘Wind-Water’.

Invasion of Wind in the channels of the 
face (facial paralysis)

As mentioned above, external Wind can invade the 
body without causing ‘exterior symptoms’: that is, the 
aversion to cold and fever that one gets when one 
catches the common cold or influenza.

In some cases, external Wind can simply invade the 
channels of the face, causing facial paralysis (Bell’s 
palsy). This is called peripheral facial paralysis in 
Western medicine (as it involves only the peripheral 
nerves) to distinguish it from the ‘central’ facial paraly-
sis caused by a stroke (which involves the central 
nervous system).

As Wind contracts and stiffens things, an invasion of 
external Wind in the channels of the face causes facial 
paralysis: this involves especially the Stomach and 
Large Intestine channels.

Chinese medicine makes a further distinction in 
terms of channels affected as, if external Wind affects 
the main channels of the face, it causes paralysis; if it 
affects only the Connecting channels of the face, it 
causes purely numbness.

Clinical note

L.I.-4 Hegu and T.B.-5 Waiguan are the main distal points to use 
for facial paralysis while ST-7 Xiaguan is the main local point

Invasion of Wind in the channels and 
joints (Painful Obstruction Syndrome)

Another example of invasion of external Wind without 
exterior symptoms is that which occurs when external 
Wind invades the channels and settles in the joints:


### RIGHT COLUMN

6
this is called Painful Obstruction Syndrome (Bi 
Syndrome).

Painful Obstruction Syndrome is usually caused by 
invasion of Wind, Dampness or Cold but Wind is always 
present as it acts as a ‘spearhead’ for Dampness and 
Cold to invade the joints.

When Wind is the main cause of Painful Obstruction 
Syndrome, the joint pain is typically ‘wandering’ (it 
moves from joint to joint).

Affliction of the Liver channel by  
external Wind

External Wind may invade the Liver channel in the 
neck and head, causing a stiff neck (as it also affects 
the Gall Bladder channel). External Wind may also 
aggravate a condition of Liver-Yang rising and precipi-
tate a headache: migraine sufferers (when this is 
caused by Liver-Yang rising) often report that a 
migraine attack may be precipitated by windy weather.

Clinical note

S.I.-3 Houxi, LIV-3 Taichong, Du-16 Fengfu and G.B.-20 Fengchi 
are the main points to expel external Wind in the Liver channel

Wind in the skin

Identification of Patterns According to Pathogenic Factors

Finally, Wind in the skin plays a major role in skin dis-
eases: it is a special type of Wind that is neither exter-
nal nor internal, or both at the same time. However, it 
is best categorized and discussed under external Wind. 
Wind in the skin may be seen as a type of external 
Wind in so far as many skin diseases may be caused or 
aggravated by external wind. On the other hand, Wind 
in the skin may be seen as a type of internal Wind as it 
may sometimes originate from a Liver disharmony: for 
example, Liver-Fire or Liver-Blood deficiency.

Box 43.1 summarizes external Wind invasions.
The chief characteristics of Wind in the skin are:

• Intense generalized itching
• Skin rashes that appear suddenly and spread rapidly
• Small, red papules, especially in the top part of the body

Box 43.1  External Wind invasions

• Invasion of Wind in the Lung’s Defensive Qi portion

• Invasion of Wind in the channels and joints (Painful

Obstruction Syndrome)
• Affliction of the Liver channel by external Wind (e.g.

Liver-Yang headache elicited by external Wind)
• Wind in the skin

Internal Wind

Although some of the clinical manifestations are the 
same, internal Wind arises from completely different 
causes than external Wind. Many of its manifestations 
are also different.

The main clinical manifestations of interior Wind are: 
tremors, tics, severe dizziness, vertigo and numbness. 
In severe cases, they are: convulsions, unconscious-
ness, opisthotonos, hemiplegia and deviation of mouth.

Clinical note

LIV-3 Taichong, Du-16 Fengfu and G.B.-20 Fengchi are the main 
points to extinguish internal Wind. Other points depend on the 
underlying condition

IDENTIFICATION OF PATTERNS

Interior Wind is always related to a Liver dishar-
mony. It can arise from several different conditions:

• Extreme Heat can give rise to Liver-Wind. This happens in the

late stages of febrile diseases when the Heat enters the Blood 
portion and generates Wind. This process is like the wind 
generated by a large forest fire. The clinical manifestations 
are a high fever, delirium, convulsions, coma and 
opisthotonos. These signs are frequently seen in meningitis 
and are due to Wind in the Liver and Heat in the Pericardium.
• Liver-Yang rising can give rise to Liver-Wind in prolonged

cases. The clinical manifestations are severe dizziness, 
vertigo, headache, tremors, tics and irritability.
• Liver-Fire can give rise to Liver-Wind.
• Deficiency of Liver-Blood and/or Liver-Yin can give rise to

Liver-Wind. This is due to the deficiency of Blood creating 
an empty space within the blood vessels which is taken up 
by interior Wind. This could be compared to the draughts 
generated sometimes in certain underground (subway) 
stations. The clinical manifestations are numbness, dizziness, 
blurred vision, tics and slight tremors (in Chinese called 
‘chicken feet Wind’ as the tremors are like the jerky movements 
of chicken feet when they scour the ground for food).
• Deficiency of Kidney- and Liver-Yin may also give rise to

internal Wind. This is more common in the elderly. The 
clinical manifestations are dizziness, vertigo, slight tremors.

are discussed in greater detail in chapter 34. Box 43.2

COLD

Cold is a Yin pathogenic factor and, as such, it tends to 
injure Yang. Cold pertains to Winter but it may invade 
the body at any time of year. It injures especially the 
Kidneys. Chapter 74 of the ‘Simple Questions’ says: 
‘Cold contracts and it pertains to the Kidneys.’2

Cold can be exterior or interior and Full or Empty. 
Exterior Cold is by definition Full, while interior Cold 
can be Full or Empty. Interior Full-Cold derives from the 
invasion of exterior Cold: once it is in the Interior and 
in the Internal Organs, Cold is interior. Interior Empty-
Cold can be formed in one of two ways: either it derives 
from interior Full-Cold (because after some time Full-
Cold damages Yang and therefore becomes Empty-
Cold), or it derives from a Yang deficiency (of the Spleen 
and/or Kidneys) (Figs 43.2 and 43.3).

We can identify five main characteristics of Cold.

Cold injures Yang

Cold, whether exterior or interior, tends to injure Yang: 
the Spleen and the Kidneys are usually the first organs 
to be affected by Cold.

Cold congeals Blood

Cold congeals Blood and it is therefore a major cause 
of Blood stasis. When Blood stagnates, there is intense 
pain: when the stasis derives from Cold, the pain is 
accompanied by chilliness, it is aggravated by cold and 
it is alleviated by the application of heat. Invasion of 
Cold in the Uterus causing Blood stasis in this organ is 
a very common example of Cold congealing Blood: it 
results in painful periods with small, dark clots.

Chapter 39 of the ‘Simple Questions’ says: ‘When 
Cold invades the channels it retards circulation; outside  
the channels, it decreases Blood [circulation], inside the 
channels it impairs the movement of Qi and this results in

together with Blood stasis discussed above, is another 
cause of pain from Cold.

For this reason, there is a saying that states ‘Reten-
tion of Cold causes pain’.6

As cold causes contraction, contraction of muscles 
and sinews by Cold causes stiffness and pain.

Cold causes clear discharges

Cold is often manifested with thin, watery and clear 
fluid discharges, such as a clear white discharge from 
the nose, very pale urine, watery loose stools and clear

Box 43.3  Characteristics of Cold

• Cold is Yin and it injures Yang
• Cold congeals (Blood)
• Cold contracts
• Cold causes clear discharges
• Cold pertains to the Kidneys

watery vaginal discharges. Another saying clarifies 
this characteristic of Cold: ‘A disease characterized by 
thin, clear, watery and cool discharges is due to Cold.’7

Cold pertains to the Kidneys

In the scheme of correspondences among organs, 
seasons and climates, Cold pertains to Winter and to 
the Kidneys. This means that Cold is obviously more 
prevalent in Winter and that it has a strong tendency 
to injure the Kidneys (specifically Kidney-Yang). 
However, it should be pointed out that Cold can occur 
in any season and that it injures other organs besides 
the Kidneys (Spleen, Stomach, Heart, Intestines, 
Uterus).

Box 43.3 summarizes the characteristics of Cold.
The general clinical manifestations of Cold (without 
distinguishing between Full- or Empty-Cold) are:

• Feeling cold
• Cold limbs
• Thin clear discharges
• Pain (of a spastic or crampy nature)
• Aggravation from cold and alleviation from application

• Invasion of the channels and joints by Cold (Painful

• Invasion of the muscles and sinews by Cold
• Invasion of external Cold in Stomach, Intestines and

Uterus
• Internal Cold

• Full-Cold

734


### RIGHT COLUMN

External Cold

We can identify four main types of invasion of external 
Cold (Fig. 43.4):

1. Cold, spearheaded by Wind, can invade the Exterior of the

body and give rise to symptoms of Wind-Cold, already 
described above
2. Cold can invade the channels and joints directly (without

exterior symptoms) and cause Painful Obstruction 
Syndrome (Bi Syndrome), with pain that is often (but not 
exclusively) in one joint
3. Cold can invade the muscles and sinews causing local pain

and stiffness
4. Cold can invade three organs directly, i.e. the Stomach,

Intestines and Uterus

Invasion of Cold in the Lung’s Defensive 
Qi portion

This corresponds to an invasion of Wind-Cold, which 
has already been discussed above.

Invasion of the channels and joints by 
Cold (Painful Obstruction Syndrome)

When Cold invades the channels and settles in the 
joints it causes Cold Painful Obstruction Syndrome (Bi 
Syndrome). This is characterized by intense pain, often 
in a single joint. The pain is aggravated by exposure to 
cold and alleviated by the application of heat.

Invasion of the muscles and  
sinews by Cold

External Cold can invade the muscles and sinews, 
causing local pain and stiffness. This is a very common 
occurrence in the muscles of the shoulders and neck. 
For example, a very stiff, locked neck with a sudden 
onset is often due to Cold in the muscles of the neck.

Invasion of external Cold in Stomach, 
Intestines and Uterus

External Cold can invade three organs directly: these 
are the Stomach (causing epigastric pain and vomit-
ing), the Intestines (causing abdominal pain and diar-
rhoea) and the Uterus (causing acute dysmenorrhoea). 
In all these three cases the symptoms are accompanied 
by chilliness and the pain is aggravated by cold and 
alleviated by the application of heat.

Please note that although this Cold is of external 
origin, once in these three organs, it is internal Cold.

Box 43.4 summarizes external Cold invasions.

Internal Cold

Internal Cold can be Full or Empty (see ch. 30 on the 
Eight Principles). Interior Full-Cold originates from 
external Cold, which may be either Wind-Cold or Cold 
invading certain organs directly. These cases have just 
been mentioned. In both cases, if the exterior Cold pen-
etrates in the Interior and in the Internal Organs, it 
becomes interior Full-Cold (Fig. 43.5).

The other two types of invasion of external Cold,  
i.e. Cold invading channels and joints (Painful

and sinews, tend to remain external.

Identification of Patterns According to Pathogenic Factors

Full-Cold

The main clinical manifestations of Full-Cold are:

• Feeling cold
• Cold limbs
• Thin clear discharges
• Severe pain
• Aggravation of pain from pressure
• Aggravation from cold and alleviation from application of

heat
• Desire for warm drinks
• No thirst
• Bright white complexion
• Thick, white tongue coating
• Slow-Full-Tight pulse

Generally speaking, interior Full-Cold can last only a 
relatively short time. After prolonged retention, inte-
rior Cold consumes Yang (often of the Spleen first), 
giving rise to Empty-Cold. Thus a Full-Cold pattern can 
turn into an Empty-Cold one.

The clinical manifestations of Full- and Empty-Cold 
are very similar as they are the same in nature. The 
main difference is that Full-Cold is characterized by an 
acute onset, severe pain and a tongue and pulse of the 
Excess type: for example, the tongue has a thick white 
coating and the pulse is Full and Tight.

Empty-Cold

The main clinical manifestations of Empty-Cold are:

• Feeling cold
• Cold limbs
• Thin clear discharges
• Dull pain
• Amelioration of pain from pressure
• Aggravation from cold and alleviation from application of

heat
• Desire for warm drinks
• No thirst
• Dull white complexion
• Thin, white tongue coating
• Pale tongue body
• Slow-Weak pulse

Internal Empty-Cold arises from deficiency of Yang, 
usually of the Spleen, Lungs or Kidneys. In this case 
the Cold does not come from the exterior, but is interi-
orly generated by deficiency of Yang (Fig. 43.6).

As mentioned above, Empty-Cold may also derive 
from the transformation of Full-Cold: in fact, Full-Cold 
cannot last a long time as Cold injures Yang and  
therefore after some time it will induce a Yang defi-
ciency. When that happens, Full-Cold changes into 
Empty-Cold.

Apart from the general manifestations outlined 
above, other symptoms vary according to which organ 
is mostly affected. The Heart, Lungs, Spleen, Stomach 
and Kidneys can suffer from deficiency of Yang and 
interior Cold.

The symptoms of Heart-Yang deficiency (in addition

and a Knotted pulse.

In Lung-Qi deficiency they are a propensity to catch 
colds and a cough with white mucus.

In Spleen-Yang deficiency they are diarrhoea or 
loose stools with some abdominal pain.

In Kidney-Yang deficiency they are frequent, pale 
and profuse urination, lower backache, cold feet and 
knees and impotence in men or white leucorrhoea in 
women.

The manifestations of Yang deficiency of the various 
organs have been discussed in the chapters on the iden-
tification of patterns according to the Internal Organs.

Table 43.1 lists the clinical manifestations of Full- 
and Empty-Cold.

SUMMER-HEAT

Summer-Heat is a Yang pathogenic factor and, as  
such, it tends to injure Yin. This pathogenic factor is 
different from the others in two ways: first, it is defi-
nitely related to a specific season since it can only occur



============================================================
[Page 765]
============================================================

### LEFT COLUMN

in the Summer; secondly, it can be only an external 
pathogenic factor with no internal equivalent.

The clinical manifestations of Summer-Heat are:

• Fever
• Aversion to cold
• Sweating
• Headache
• A feeling of heaviness
• An uncomfortable sensation in the epigastrium
• Irritability
• Thirst
• Tongue Red in the front or sides with a white sticky coating
• Soggy and Rapid pulse

Summer-Heat invades the Defensive Qi portion of the 
body (i.e. the Exterior) and that is why there is aversion 
to cold (even though the exterior Heat is intense). 
However, it has the strong tendency to move to the Qi 
level almost from the beginning and that is why there 
are symptoms of interior Heat such as irritability, 
thirst, Red tongue and Rapid pulse.

Summer-Heat frequently combines with Dampness 
and that is why there is a feeling of heaviness and 
uncomfortable sensation of the epigastrium, a sticky 
tongue coating and a Soggy pulse. The tongue coating 
is white because the pathogenic factor is on the 
Exterior.

To summarize, Summer-Heat includes manifesta-
tions of external Wind, Dampness and interior Heat.

In severe cases, Summer-Heat can invade the Peri-
cardium and cause clouding of the mind, manifesting 
with delirium or unconsciousness.

The characteristics of Summer-Heat may be sum-
marized as follows.

Summer-Heat injures Yin

Summer-Heat is a Yang pathogenic factor and there-
fore it has a strong tendency to injure Yin (i.e. to injure 
fluids).

Summer-Heat is a seasonal pathogenic factor

Summer-Heat can occur only in the Summer and it can 
be only external (i.e. contrary to other external patho-
genic factors, there is no internal equivalent).

Summer-Heat invades the top of the body

Summer-Heat invades the top of the body and for this 
reason there is a headache.


### RIGHT COLUMN

Summer-Heat is scattering

The scattering nature of Summer-Heat causes 
sweating.

Summer-Heat has some interior Heat

Summer-Heat has a tendency to move into the Interior 
very quickly and, for this reason, there are some symp-
toms of interior Heat such as irritability and thirst.

Summer-Heat harbours Dampness

Summer-Heat often harbours Dampness and, for this 
reason, there is a feeling of heaviness and an uncom-
fortable sensation of the epigastrium.

Box 43.5 summarizes the characteristics of 
Summer-Heat.

Box 43.5  Characteristics of Summer-Heat

• Summer-Heat injures Yin
• Summer-Heat is a seasonal pathogenic factor
• Summer-Heat invades the top of the body
• Summer-Heat is scattering
• Summer-Heat has some interior Heat
• Summer-Heat harbours Dampness

DAMPNESS

Identification of Patterns According to Pathogenic Factors

Dampness is a Yin pathogenic factor and it tends to 
injure Yang. Climatic Dampness refers not only to 
damp weather but also to living conditions such as 
living in a damp house, wearing wet clothes, wading in 
water, working in damp places or sitting on damp 
ground.

The characteristics of Dampness are that it is sticky, 
it is difficult to get rid of, it is heavy, it slows things 
down, it infuses downwards and it causes repeated 
attacks. When exterior Dampness invades the body, it 
tends to invade the lower part first, typically the legs. 
From the legs, it can flow upwards in the leg channels 
to settle in any of the pelvic cavity organs. If it settles 
in the female genital system it causes vaginal dis-
charges, if it settles in the Intestines it will cause loose 
stools and if it settles in the Bladder it will cause diffi-
culty, frequency and burning of urination.

The ‘Simple Questions’ in chapter 29 says: ‘Wind is a 
Yang pathogenic factor, Dampness is a Yin pathogenic 
factor; in invasions of Wind the top part of the body is 
affected first, in invasions of Dampness the lower part of 
the body is affected first.’8

Box 43.6  General Dampness manifestations

• Feeling of heaviness
• Poor appetite
• Feeling of fullness
• Sticky taste
• Urinary difficulty
• Vaginal discharge
• Sticky tongue coating
• Slippery or Soggy pulse

The clinical manifestations of Dampness are 
extremely varied according to its location and nature 
(hot or cold), but the general ones are a feeling of heav-
iness of body or head, no appetite, a feeling of fullness 
of the chest or epigastrium, a sticky taste, urinary dif-
ficulty, a white sticky vaginal discharge, a sticky tongue 
coating and a Slippery or Soggy pulse.

Box 43.6 summarizes the general manifestations of 
Dampness.

The various clinical manifestations can be correlated 
to the main characteristics of Dampness as follows.

Dampness is heavy

Dampness is naturally ‘heavy’: this weighs the body 
down and causes a feeling of tiredness, heaviness of 
limbs or head, or a ‘muzzy’ (‘fuzzy’) feeling of the head. 
Since Dampness is heavy, it causes a feeling of fullness 
and oppression of the chest, epigastrium or abdomen 
and it tends to settle in the Lower Burner. However, 
Dampness often affects the head too, causing the 
above-mentioned symptoms. This happens because it 
prevents the clear Yang from ascending to the head to 
brighten the sense orifices and clear the brain.

IDENTIFICATION OF PATTERNS

Dampness is dirty

Dampness is ‘dirty’ and is reflected in dirty discharges, 
such as cloudy urine, vaginal discharges or skin dis-
eases characterized by thick and dirty fluids oozing out, 
such as in certain types of eczema.

Dampness is sticky

Dampness is ‘sticky’ and this is reflected in a sticky 
tongue coating, sticky taste and Slippery pulse. The 
sticky nature of Dampness also accounts for its being 
very difficult to get rid of. It often becomes chronic, 
manifesting in frequent, recurrent bouts.

Box 43.7 summarizes the qualities of Dampness.
The clinical manifestations of Dampness can be clas-
sified according to its location as follows (Fig. 43.7):

738


### RIGHT COLUMN

Box 43.7  Qualities of Dampness

• Heaviness
• Dirtiness
• Stickiness

Head: feeling of heaviness and muzziness (fuzziness) of the head
Eyes: red and swollen eyelids, eyes oozing fluid, styes
Mouth: mouth ulcers on gums, swollen red lips
Stomach and Spleen: feeling of fullness of epigastrium, feeling

of fullness after eating, sticky taste, loose stools, poor 
appetite, Soggy pulse
Lower Burner: excessive vaginal discharge, painful periods,

infertility, turbid urine, difficult and painful urination, 
scrotal sweating or eczema, genital eczema, genital itching
Skin: vesicles (Dampness without Heat), papules (Damp-Heat

with more Heat), greasy sweat, any oozing skin lesion
Joints: swollen and painful joints (Fixed Painful Obstruction

Dampness can cause a large variety of diseases 
according to its location which, without distinguishing 
internal from external Dampness, can be summarized 
in three locations:

1. Internal organs
2. Channels
3. Skin

The range of diseases according to the location of 
Dampness is as follows:

Internal Organs

• Stomach and Spleen (epigastric pain and fullness, poor

digestion, feeling of fullness, a sticky taste, poor appetite)
• Gall Bladder (hypochondrial fullness and pain)
• Bladder (difficult and painful urination, cloudy urine)
• Uterus (infertility, excessive vaginal discharge, mid-cycle

pain and/or bleeding)
• Intestines (loose stools with mucus, abdominal fullness and

pain)
• Kidneys (cloudy urine, difficult urination)
• Liver (hypochondrial fullness, distension and pain, jaundice)

Channels

• In the joints (Damp Painful Obstruction Syndrome, achy

and swollen joints)
• In the head (feeling of heaviness of the head, dull frontal

headache)

Skin

• Dampness is the cause of many skin diseases manifesting

with oozing skin lesions, vesicles or papules

SP-9 Yinlingquan. These are only general points and many 
other can be used according to type and location of 
Dampness

The classification of Dampness is quite complex and 
can be divided into the two broad categories of external 
or internal Dampness as follows:
EXTERNAL DAMPNESS

•	 Invasion of Dampness in the Internal Organs

-	 External invasion of Dampness in Bladder
-	 External invasion of Dampness in Stomach
-	 External invasion of Dampness in Intestines
-	 External invasion of Dampness in Uterus
-	 External invasion of Dampness in Gall Bladder
-	 External invasion of Dampness in Spleen
•	 Invasion of acute, external Dampness in channels

IDENTIFICATION OF PATTERNS

External Dampness

There are three possible types of invasions of external 
Dampness:

1. An invasion of Dampness that may affect the Bladder,

Intestines, Stomach, Uterus and Gall Bladder
2. An invasion of Dampness in the channels causing Damp

Painful Obstruction Syndrome in its acute stage
3. An invasion of Damp-Heat of the Warm Disease type at the

Defensive Qi level, manifesting with fever

Invasion of external Dampness in 
Internal Organs

External Dampness can invade the Bladder, Intestines, 
Stomach, Uterus and Gall Bladder.

Invasion of external Dampness in Bladder

Difficulty and pain on urination with acute onset, 
scanty but frequent urination, cloudy urine, feeling of 
heaviness in the lower abdomen, tongue with a thick 
sticky coating on the root, pulse perhaps Slippery on 
the Left-Rear position.

Invasion of external Dampness  
in the Stomach

Acute onset of vomiting and/or watery diarrhoea 
without smell, epigastric pain, a feeling of stuffiness of 
the epigastrium, cold limbs, no appetite, white, thick 
and sticky tongue coating, Slippery pulse.

Invasion of external Dampness  
in Intestines

Acute onset of watery diarrhoea without smell, 
abdominal pain, a feeling of heaviness, tongue with a 
sticky thick white coating, Slippery pulse.

Invasion of external Dampness in Uterus

Acute onset of painful period (as a one-off when 
periods were not previously painful), excessive vaginal 
discharge, thick sticky white tongue coating on the 
root, Slippery pulse.



============================================================

### LEFT COLUMN

Invasion of external Dampness  
in Gall Bladder

Acute onset of hypochondrial pain, a feeling of heavi-
ness, bitter taste, tongue with a sticky yellow coating 
on one side, Slippery pulse.

Invasion of acute, external Dampness  
in channels

This is an acute stage of Damp Painful Obstruction 
Syndrome (Bi Syndrome). When one joint only is 
affected, it is usually Cold-Dampness; when several 
joints are affected, it is often due to Damp-Heat. The 
main manifestations are achy and swollen joints with 
a feeling of heaviness occurring with sudden onset.

Invasion of acute, external Damp-Heat at 
the Defensive Qi level

This can be external Damp-Heat or Summer-Heat 
mixed with Dampness.

External Damp-Heat at Defensive Qi level

Aversion to cold, fever, body feels hot to touch, swollen 
glands, fever higher in the afternoon, headache as if 
wrapped, a feeling of oppression of the chest and epi-
gastrium, a sticky taste, no thirst, tongue with a white 
sticky coating (it is white because it is in the beginning 
stage), pulse Soggy.

External Summer-Heat with Dampness

Fever, slight aversion to cold, sweating, headache, a 
feeling of heaviness of the body, an uncomfortable  
sensation of the epigastrium, irritability, thirst, Red 
tongue with a sticky tongue coating, Soggy-Rapid 
pulse.

Internal Dampness

Interior Dampness arises from a deficiency of Spleen 
and sometimes Kidneys. If the Spleen function of 
transformation and transportation of Body Fluids fails, 
these will not be transformed and will accumulate to 
form Dampness.

There are two possible types of internal Dampness, 
one chronic, the other acute.

Chronic internal Dampness may involve:

• The Internal Organs
• The channels
• The skin

Acute internal Dampness involves Damp-Heat at the 
Qi level within the Four-Level identification of patterns 
acute episodes of a chronic condition.

Chronic Dampness

Chronic Dampness derives either from acute invasion 
of external Dampness or from dietary causes.

Chronic Dampness in the  
Internal Organs

Identification of Patterns According to Pathogenic Factors

Chronic, internal Dampness may be in any of the fol-
lowing organs:

• Stomach and Spleen
• Bladder
• Intestines
• Uterus
• Gall Bladder
• Liver
• Kidneys

The clinical manifestations of chronic internal 
Dampness in the Internal Organs are indicated below.

Dampness in Stomach and Spleen

Epigastric and abdominal fullness and heaviness, 
nausea, vomiting, sticky taste, loose stools with mucus, 
sticky tongue coating, Soggy pulse.

Dampness in Bladder

Urinary difficulty with slight or no pain, cloudy  
urine, sticky coating on the root of the tongue, Soggy 
pulse.

### LEFT COLUMN

Dampness in Intestines

Abdominal fullness and heaviness, loose stools with 
mucus, sticky coating on the root of the tongue, Soggy 
pulse.

Dampness in Uterus

Abdominal fullness and heaviness, vaginal discharge, 
mid-cycle pain and/or bleeding, painful periods, sticky 
tongue coating on the root, Soggy pulse.

Dampness in Gall Bladder

Hypochondrial fullness and pain, unilateral sticky 
tongue coating, Soggy pulse.

Dampness in Liver

Urinary difficulty and pain, cloudy urine, hypogastric 
fullness and distension, vaginal discharge, genital sores 
and itching, sticky tongue coating on the root, Soggy 
pulse.

Dampness in Kidneys

Urinary difficulty and pain, cloudy urine, feeling of 
heaviness of the back, backache, sticky tongue coating 
on the root, Soggy pulse.

Chronic Dampness in the channels

IDENTIFICATION OF PATTERNS

Chronic retention of Dampness in the channels and 
joints is, of course, the main cause of Damp Painful 
Obstruction Syndrome. This manifests with aching, 
swelling and heaviness of the joints.

Chronic Dampness in the skin

Chronic retention of Dampness in the skin is the main 
cause of numerous skin diseases, chiefly eczema (atopic 
or not). Dampness in the skin manifests with vesicles, 
papules or with skin lesions oozing fluid, and with 
puffiness of the skin.

Acute Dampness

Generally speaking, acute interior Dampness can be 
only that seen at the Qi level of the identification  
of patterns according to the Four Levels (described in 
ch. 45). This is because acute attacks of Dampness are 
generally of exterior origin.

Of course, a condition of chronic Dampness can  
give rise to occasional acute flare-ups: this happens  
for example in interstitial cystitis (usually due to

Box 43.9 summarizes internal Dampness.

Case history 43.1

A young woman of 32 suffered from pain in the 
muscles of neck, shoulders and arms and extreme 
tiredness. This had started 4 months previously when 
she fell ill with influenza symptoms, a sore throat, 
ache in the joints and temperature in May. After 2 
weeks she developed more pain in both joints and 
muscles, the temperature continued at night, she 
had a feeling of heaviness and she felt hot and cold. 
This continued for 3 months. The appetite was poor, 
the sleep was disturbed and she experienced epigas-
tric fullness and distension after eating. The tongue 
was of a normal colour and had a sticky yellow 
coating on the root extending towards the centre. 
The pulse was Soggy.

The sudden attack of fever with ache in the 
muscles and joints and a feeling of heaviness indi-
cates the invasion of exterior Damp-Heat. The tem-
perature at night also indicates Damp-Heat, which is 
also confirmed by the sticky yellow coating on the 
tongue. The long duration of the problem and reten-
tion of Dampness have weakened Spleen-Qi, hence 
the extreme tiredness and Soggy pulse. Her pains in 
the muscles are still due to the retention of Damp-
ness in the muscles.

Differences between Dampness  
and Phlegm

### LEFT COLUMN

Dampness and Phlegm are similar in nature. Both 
originate from a dysfunction of the Spleen in trans-
forming and transporting fluids. There are, however, 
some differences between Dampness and Phlegm:

1. Dampness can be of exterior or interior origin, whereas

Phlegm can originate only from an interior dysfunction
2. Interior Dampness originates mostly from the impairment

of the Spleen in transforming and transporting Body 
Fluids, whereas the Lungs and Kidneys are also involved in 
the formation of Phlegm
3. Although Dampness can settle in the head, preventing

the clear Yang from ascending, it primarily affects the 
lower part of the body, while Phlegm primarily affects the 
middle and upper part of the body. For example, urinary 
problems are often caused by Dampness in the Lower 
Burner and Bladder, while intestinal problems manifesting 
with mucus or blood in the stools are due to Dampness 
and Heat in the Intestines. Phlegm, on the other hand, 
mostly affects the chest, causing a feeling of oppression in 
the chest, the throat, causing some sputum in the throat, 
or the head, causing a feeling of heaviness, muzziness and 
dizziness
4. Dampness in the head causes a characteristic feeling of

heaviness while Phlegm, contrary to Dampness, also 
causes dizziness
5. Phlegm can ‘mist’ the Mind, causing mental problems or

sometimes mental retardation in children while Dampness 
has no such effect
6. Phlegm can be retained in the channels and under the

skin, causing swelling and lumps, while Dampness mostly 
affects the Internal Organs, skin or joints
7. Interior Dampness originates only from a Spleen

dysfunction, while Phlegm can also originate from the 
condensing action of Fire on Body Fluids
8. Dampness affects mostly the Spleen, Stomach, Gall

Bladder, Bladder, and Intestines (hence, apart from the 
Spleen, mostly the Yang organs), while Phlegm affects 
mostly the Lungs, Heart, Kidney and Stomach (hence, 
apart from the Stomach, mostly the Yin organs)
9. Although Phlegm has the nature of heaviness, it does not

have Dampness’s characteristics of being sticky, dirty and 
flowing downwards
10. Phlegm can associate with various other pathogenic

factors giving rise to Cold-Phlegm, Damp-Phlegm, 
Wind-Phlegm, Dry-Phlegm, Phlegm-Heat and Qi-Phlegm, 
while Dampness associates with Cold, Heat or Wind
11. Phlegm can assume a very watery and dilute form called

Phlegm-Fluids while Dampness only assumes one form
12. From the point of view of pulse diagnosis, both Dampness

and Phlegm can manifest with a Slippery pulse. However, 
Dampness can also manifest with a Soggy pulse, while 
Phlegm can manifest also with a Wiry pulse


### RIGHT COLUMN

13. From the point of view of tongue diagnosis, both

Dampness and Phlegm can manifest with a sticky coating 
but Phlegm can also manifest with a dry and rough 
coating. This type of coating is frequently seen inside  
a central crack in the Stomach area of the tongue, 
indicating the presence of Phlegm-Heat in the  
Stomach
14. From the point of view of acupuncture treatment,

although there are many similarities in the treatment of 
Dampness and Phlegm, the Spleen channel is mostly used 
to eliminate Dampness, while the Stomach channel is 
mostly used to resolve Phlegm. For example, SP-9 
Yinlingquan, SP-6 Sanyinjiao and SP-3 Taibai are the main 
points to eliminate Dampness, while ST-40 Fenglong is the 
most important point to resolve Phlegm
15. Dampness can be acute or chronic whereas Phlegm can

be only chronic (with the important exception of Phlegm 
arising in a few days as a result of an invasion of Wind that 
has become interior and affected the Lungs)
16. Finally, from the point of view of herbal treatment,

the herbs used to drain Dampness or resolve Phlegm 
belong to two entirely different categories with different 
therapeutic effect

DRYNESS

Dryness is a Yang pathogenic factor and it tends to 
injure Blood or Yin. It is related to the season of autumn 
and to the Lungs. It arises in very dry weather, but it 
can also occur in some artificial conditions such as in 
very dry, centrally heated buildings.

Identification of Patterns According to Pathogenic Factors

The clinical manifestations are simply characterized 
by dryness and they are:

• Dry throat
• Dry lips
• Dry tongue
• Dry mouth
• Dry skin
• Dry stools
• Scanty urination

The discussion of Dryness will be done according to 
the following headings:

• Dryness

• External Dryness
• Internal Dryness

– Stomach-Dryness
– Lung-Dryness
– Kidney-Dryness

Figure 43.9  Origin of internal Dryness

External Dryness

External Dryness arises from invasion of exterior 
Wind-Dryness. This occurs when the person suffers an 
invasion of Wind either in very dry climates or when 
he or she is exposed to artificial, very dry working 
conditions.

As this is an invasion of external Wind, there is aver-
sion to cold and fever. Other symptoms are a dry cough, 
dry mouth, dry throat, dry nose, dry tongue and a 
Floating pulse.

Internal Dryness

Internal Dryness can arise in one of three ways  
(Fig. 43.9):

IDENTIFICATION OF PATTERNS

1. It can develop from external Dryness
2. It can derive from deficiency of Yin
3. It can arise by itself internally, usually from dietary causes

(in which case it may lead to Yin deficiency)

Internal causes of Dryness include the excessive con-
sumption of drying foods (such as baked foods), irregu-
lar eating, which weakens Stomach-Yin, excessive use 
of the voice (e.g. teachers), which weakens Lung-Yin, 
excessive sexual activity in men, which weakens 
Kidney-Yin, chronic menorrhagia in women, which 
damages Blood and Liver- and Kidney-Yin and smoking, 
which injures Lung- and Kidney-Yin. It is interesting 
to note that, from the point of view of Chinese medi-
cine, tobacco has a drying nature and it dries up Blood, 
Yin and Essence, affecting negatively not only the 
Lungs but also the Kidneys.

Box 43.10 summarizes internal causes of Dryness.

Tobacco smoking injures Blood, Kidney-Yin and  
Kidney-Essence. It causes dryness

### RIGHT COLUMN

Box 43.10  Internal causes of Dryness

• Excessive consumption of drying foods (e.g. baked foods)
• Irregular eating, which weakens Stomach-Yin
• Excessive use of the voice (e.g. teachers), which weakens

Lung-Yin
• Excessive sexual activity in men, which weakens Kidney-Yin
• Chronic menorrhagia in women, which damages Blood and

Liver- and Kidney-Yin
• Tobacco smoking, which injures Lung- and Kidney-Yin

Three organs are particularly affected by Drynes, 
(namely, the Stomach, Lungs and Kidneys), and the 
symptoms are the same as for exterior Dryness. As 
mentioned above, interior Dryness is not always the 
result of Yin deficiency as it is sometimes the stage pre-
ceding it. There is a saying: ‘Withering and cracking is 
due to Dryness.’9 This describes the dry skin and cracked 
tongue often seen in Dryness.

Stomach-Dryness

The Stomach is the origin of fluids and if one has an 
irregular diet, such as eating late at night, eating in a 
hurry or going back to work straight after eating, the 
Stomach fluids are depleted and this leads to a state of 
dryness, which is the precursor of Yin deficiency.

The main clinical manifestations of Stomach-Dry-
ness are a dry mouth, dry tongue, cracks on the tongue.

Clinical note

The main points for Stomach Dryness are Ren-12 Zhongwan, 
ST-36 Zusanli and SP-6 Sanyinjiao

Lung-Dryness

The Lungs like to be kept moist (from the ‘vapour’ 
arising from the Kidneys) and dislike Dryness. Exces-
sive use of the voice over many years can cause Dryness 
in the Lungs, which can be the precursor of Lung-Qi 
deficiency.

The main clinical manifestations of Lung-Dryness 
are a dry mouth and throat, dry cough, dry tongue, dry 
skin and a hoarse voice. Due to the relationship with 
the Large Intestine, Dryness of the Lungs in severe 
cases can cause dry stools.

The main clinical manifestations of Kidney-Dryness 
are a dry throat with desire to sip water at night, scanty 
urination, dry tongue with cracks, dry menstrual 
blood in women, dry skin.

FIRE

‘Fire’ and ‘Heat’ are two very common pathogenic 
factors and the terminology is fraught with difficulties.

Firstly, ‘Heat’ is generally used with at least two dif-
ferent meanings. On the one hand, ‘Heat’ is a general 
term that includes any manifestations characterized by 
Heat, which may be interior Heat, exterior Wind-Heat, 
or Fire. In this sense, ‘Fire’ comes under the general 
umbrella of ‘Heat’.

In a more narrow definition, although Heat and Fire 
share many common characteristics and the same 
nature, these two pathogenic factors differ in the degree 
of intensity (i.e. Fire is more intense than Heat) and 
their clinical manifestations (and treatment) are some-
what different.

There is another important difference between Heat 
and Fire. While Heat always denotes pathological  
Heat, the term ‘Fire’ can denote either the physio-
logical Fire of the body (the Minister Fire or the  
Fire of the Gate of Life) or pathological Fire (as in 
‘Liver-Fire’).

In the ‘Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medi-
cine’, the physiological Fire of the body is sometimes 
called ‘Lesser Fire’ (Shao Huo) and the pathological Fire 
‘Exuberant Fire’ (Zhuang Huo). Chapter 5 of the ‘Simple 
Questions’ clearly emphasizes the pathological nature 
of Exuberant Fire and the physiological one of Lesser 
Fire: ‘Exuberant Fire [zhuang huo] consumes Qi, Lesser 
Fire [shao huo] makes Qi strong. Exuberant Fire scatters 
Qi, Lesser Fire generates Qi’10 (Fig. 43.10).

Identification of Patterns According to Pathogenic Factors

Fire is primarily an internal pathogenic factor. The 
only type of ‘external Fire’ could be considered that 
seen in Warm Diseases. Fire can derive from the trans-
formation of other exterior pathogenic factors (e.g. 
Wind, Cold, Summer-Heat, Dampness), but once it 
affects the Internal Organs, it is an interior pathogenic 
factor.

Internal dryness — ‘Lesser Fire’ (Shao Huo)

Pathological — ‘Exuberant Fire’ (Zhuang Huo)

The nature of Fire therefore is to:
Other causes of Fire are the excessive consumption 
of hot foods and alcohol, emotional stress (stagnant Qi 
turns into Fire) and smoking (Fig. 43.11).

• Rise to the head
• Dry fluids
• Injure Blood and Yin
• Cause bleeding
• Affect the Mind
• Differences between Heat and Fire
• General clinical manifestations of Fire
• Organs affected by Fire

The discussion of Fire will be done according to the 
following headings:

• Heart
• Liver
• Stomach
• Lungs
• Intestines
• Full- versus Empty-Fire
• Toxic Heat

Differences between ‘Heat’  
and ‘Fire’

As mentioned above, when used in a narrow sense the 
term ‘Heat’ denotes a milder form of Fire.

Heat and Fire have obviously the same nature and 
share similar characteristics; they will both cause 
thirst, a feeling of heat, some mental restlessness, a Red 
tongue and a Rapid pulse. However, there are some 
important differences in the clinical manifestations, 
possible complications and treatment.

IDENTIFICATION OF PATTERNS

Fire is more ‘solid’ than Heat, it tends to move and 
dry out more than Heat and this nature of Fire causes 
dark scanty urine and dry stools. Fire moves upwards 
(causing mouth ulcers, for example) or damages the 
blood vessels (causing bleeding). Also, Fire tends to 
affect the Mind more than Heat, causing anxiety, 
mental agitation, insomnia or mental illness.

### RIGHT COLUMN

The differentiation between the Bright Yang channel 
pattern and Bright Yang organ pattern of the Six- 
Stage pattern identification illustrates the difference 
between Heat and Fire well (see ch. 44). The Bright 
Yang channel pattern is characterized by Heat  
manifesting with fever, thirst and sweating, but no 
constipation or abdominal pain. The organ pattern is 
characterized by similar manifestations, but in addi-
tion, there is constipation and abdominal pain.

This is because in the organ pattern the Heat has 
become ‘solid’ and has been transformed into Fire, 
which dries up the faeces in the intestines and causes 
constipation. In addition, the organ pattern can be 
characterized by mental changes, such as delirium, as 
Fire affects the Mind. Exactly the same difference exists 
between the pattern of Stomach-Heat and that of 
Intestines Dry-Heat at the Qi level of the Four Levels 
(see ch. 45).

To give another example, Heat in the Stomach can 
cause thirst, but Fire in the Stomach will cause bleed-
ing gums, gum ulcers, and haematemesis as Fire moves 
upwards more than Heat and it agitates the Blood, 
causing bleeding.

The difference between Liver-Yang rising and  
Liver-Fire blazing upwards is another appropriate 
example of the difference between Heat and Fire.

Fire



============================================================
[Page 775]
============================================================

### LEFT COLUMN

Rising Liver-Yang results from an imbalance between 
Yin and Yang within the Liver: when Liver-Yang rises 
upwards excessively it causes dizziness, headaches, a 
dry throat, irritability and probably a red face. The dry 
throat, red face and irritability are symptoms of Heat, 
but not of Fire. If the Liver has excessive Fire, in addi-
tion to these symptoms and signs, there will be intense 
thirst, bitter taste, scanty dark urine, dry stools, pro-
nounced mental restlessness and possibly vomiting of 
blood or epistaxis.

There is an important difference in the treatment of 
Heat as opposed to Fire. In Heat patterns, the treatment 
method consists of ‘clearing Heat’ (Xie Re) with 
pungent cold herbs to drive Heat outwards (e.g. Bai Hu 
Tang); in Fire patterns, the treatment method consists 
in ‘draining Fire’ (Xie Huo) with bitter cold herbs (e.g. 
Tiao Wei Cheng Qi Tang). Unfortunately, the pinyin 
form of the two above characters xie is the same while 
the characters are different (see Glossary). I render this 
difference in English using the term ‘clearing’ for Heat 
and ‘draining’ for Fire.

I shall now discuss the clinical manifestations of Fire 
in more detail.

General clinical manifestations of Fire

Fire is a Yang pathogenic factor  
and it rises

Fire often causes clinical manifestations in the head 
because it is in its nature to rise strongly. For example, 
Liver-Fire may cause redness, swelling and pain of the 
eyes, Heart-Fire may cause tongue ulcers, Stomach-
Fire may cause mouth ulcers.

Fire is very drying

Fire is more drying than Heat and for this reason it 
causes scanty dark urine and dry stools.

Fire damages Blood and Yin

Because it is drying, Fire may damage Blood and Yin, 
especially Liver-Blood and Kidney-Yin.

Fire causes bleeding

Fire may cause bleeding from the nose if it affects the 
Liver, in vomiting if it affects the Stomach and/or Liver, 
in cough if it affects the Lungs, in the stools if it affects 
the Intestines, in the urine if it affects the Bladder and/
or Liver and under the skin if it affects the Liver.

Fire has the potential to general Wind

In the context of Warm Diseases (ch. 45), Fire at the Qi 
level may generate Liver-Wind, which would indicate 
that the disease has progressed to the Blood level 
bypassing the Nutritive Qi level. This situation is more 
likely to occur in children.

Fire affects the Mind

Fire affects the Mind more than Heat. It agitates the 
Mind, causing insomnia, mental restlessness, pro-
nounced irritability, propensity to outbursts of anger 
(in Liver-Fire) and agitation.

Fire causes ulcers with swelling

Finally, Fire may cause ulcers with a red and  
swollen rim.

Box 43.14 summarizes the main characteristics of 
Fire (as opposed to Heat).

Listed below are some of the many sayings that 
describe the nature and clinical manifestations of Heat 
or Fire:

‘Diseases manifesting with tympanic sounds are due to 
Fire.’11 This describes the condition of Fire or Heat in 
the Intestines causing borborygmi and a distended 
abdomen.

‘Abnormal changes and dark fluids are manifestations of 
Heat.’12 This describes the tendency of Fire to produce 
rapid changes for the worse in an acute condition. For 
example, when exterior Wind-Heat invades the Lung-
Defensive Qi portion, the Heat can in a few cases rapidly 
penetrate to the Pericardium, causing a high tempera-
ture and coma. This is called ‘abnormal transmission’. 
The second part of the saying refers to dark and con-
centrated fluids often produced by Fire, such as a dark 
and scanty urine.

Identification of Patterns According to Pathogenic Factors

‘Vomiting of sour fluids and sudden down-pouring are 
manifestations of Heat.’13 The first part of this saying

(as opposed to Heat)

• It blazes upwards
• It is very drying
• It damages Blood and Yin
• It may cause bleeding
• It has the potential to general Wind
• It affects the Mind
• It causes ulcers with swelling

describes a condition of Stomach-Heat causing vomit-
ing and sour regurgitation. The second part of the 
saying describes the sudden diarrhoea with foul-
smelling stools which can occur with Fire in the 
Intestines.

‘Manic behaviour is a manifestation of Fire.’14 Fire can 
easily affect the Mind, causing restlessness, agitation 
and in severe cases a manic behaviour (laughing 
uncontrollably, shouting, hitting people, talking inces-
santly, etc.). This is a specific characteristic of Fire as 
opposed to Heat. Chapter 74 of the ‘Simple Questions’ 
says: ‘Manic behaviour is due to Fire.’15

Organs affected by Fire

Fire can affect the Heart, Liver, Stomach, Lungs and 
Intestines and its clinical manifestations related to 
each of these organs have been described in detail in 
the chapters on the identification of patterns according 
to the Internal Organs (chs 32–42). Only the essential 
clinical manifestations will be listed below (Fig. 43.12).

Full- versus Empty-Fire

Fire can be of the Excess or Deficient type. The clinical 
manifestations of Excess Fire are a red face and eyes, a 
pronounced feeling of heat, a dry mouth, a bitter taste, 
constipation, scanty dark urine, thirst, mental agita-
tion, a Red tongue with dry yellow coating and a Full-
Rapid pulse. When Fire enters the Blood, it may give 
rise to dark purple spots under the skin (macules) and 
bleeding.

Deficient Fire (usually called Empty-Heat) arises from 
deficiency of Yin and is manifested with night sweat-
ing, a feeling of heat in the chest, palms and soles, red 
cheekbones, a dry mouth, afternoon feeling of heat, a 
Red tongue without coating and a Floating-Empty and 
Rapid pulse.

Full-Fire is treated by draining Fire with bitter cold 
herbs while Empty-Fire is treated by nourishing Yin 
and using herbs that clear Empty-Heat.

Table 43.2 compares and contrasts the clinical man-
ifestations of Full-Fire and Empty-Fire. Box 43.15 sum-
marizes Full- versus Empty-Fire.

Clinical note

The tongue is very important to differentiate Full- from 
Empty-Heat. In both cases it is Red, but in Full-Heat it has a 
coating whereas in Empty-Heat it does not

Identification of Patterns According to Pathogenic Factors

Toxic Heat

Before leaving the discussion of Fire, mention should 
be made of Toxic Heat (Re Du). Toxic Heat is similar in 
nature to Fire (more than to Heat).

In chronic, interior conditions Toxic Heat develops 
from Fire and its chief characteristics may be summa-
rized in five words:

• Swelling
• Redness
• Heat
• Pus
• Pain

Toxic Heat is manifested with swelling, for example 
the swelling of a large boil, a swollen appendix, some-
times a swollen prostate glands, a swollen ulcer, swollen 
and painful lymph glands, acne with very large and 
raised pustules, etc.

Toxic Heat is often manifested outwardly with 
redness and heat, such as a large boil, a carbuncle, 
acne with large pustules, etc.

749



============================================================
[Page 778]
============================================================

### LEFT COLUMN

Pus in the presence of the above manifestations of 
swelling, redness and heat also denotes Toxic Heat, for 
example a large boil and all pustules.

Finally, generally, Toxic Heat causes pain, for example 
a large boil, a swollen appendix, a swollen prostate 
gland with pain in the perineum, a carbuncle, etc.

Toxic Heat can also occur as an acute pathogenic 
factor: in this case, it accompanies Wind-Heat. For 
example, if a child suffers an invasion of Wind-Heat 
developing tonsillitis with very swollen tonsils with 
exudate, this indicates Toxic Heat.

Box 43.16 summarizes Toxic Heat.
