Identification of Patterns 
According to the Five Elements

Insulting sequence patterns

The identification of patterns according to the Five Ele-
ments is based on the pathological changes occurring 
in dysfunctions of the Generating, Overacting and 
Insulting sequences of the Five Elements.

These patterns are not of primary importance in 
practice as most of them describe clinical conditions 
which are better expressed by the Internal Organ pat-
terns. In certain cases, however, some Five-Element 
patterns can describe conditions which fall outside the 
scope of the Internal Organ patterns. An example of 
this is the pattern of Deficient Qi of Wood (manifesting 
with timidity and indecision) which is not included 
among the Internal Organ patterns.

SECTION 4

PART 6
49

We can distinguish the Five-Element patterns  
according to the Generating, Overacting and Insulting 
sequences.

The patterns discussed are:

• Generating sequence patterns

• Wood not generating Fire
• Fire not generating Earth
• Earth not generating Metal
• Metal not generating Water
• Water not generating Wood
• Overacting sequence patterns

• Wood overacting on Earth
• Earth overacting on Water
• Water overacting on Fire
• Fire overacting on Metal
• Metal overacting on Wood
• Insulting sequence patterns

• Wood insulting Metal
• Metal insulting Fire
• Fire insulting Water
• Water insulting Earth
• Earth insulting Wood

GENERATING SEQUENCE PATTERNS

These patterns describe conditions of deficiency of 
each organ when this is induced by its Mother  
Element.

Wood not generating Fire

The clinical manifestations are timidity, a lack of 
courage, indecision, palpitations and insomnia (in  
particular, waking up in the early hours of the 
morning).

This pattern is sometimes also described as a pattern 
of Deficient Gall Bladder. It is an unusual pattern in  
so far as, according to the theory of the Internal 
Organs, Liver-Qi or the Gall Bladder can hardly ever be

### LEFT COLUMN

deficient. This pattern describes such a situation. More 
than a pattern, it really describes a certain character 
and personality, and its salient feature is the lack of 
courage and timidity. It corresponds to the Internal 
Organ pattern of Deficient Gall Bladder.

In fact, Liver-Qi may be deficient and this deficiency 
manifests primarily on a psychological level with the 
above-mentioned timidity, lack of resolve and difficulty 
in making decisions. It corresponds to a situation when 
the Ethereal Soul (Hun) does not ‘come and go’ enough; 
it does not provide enough ‘movement’ to the Mind 
(Shen).

Fire not generating Earth

The clinical manifestations are loose stools, chilliness 
and weakness of the limbs.

This pattern basically describes a condition of 
Spleen-Yang deficiency due to failure of the physiologi-
cal Fire of the body in providing Heat to the Spleen to 
transform and transport. According to the theory of 
the Internal Organs, however, the Spleen derives the 
warmth necessary to its functions not from the Heart, 
but from Kidney-Yang. This is because, even though 
the Kidneys pertain to the Water Element, they also are 
the source of physiological Fire in the body. The rela-
tionship between Kidney-Yang and the Spleen is clini-
cally more relevant than that between the Fire of the 
Heart and the Spleen.

IDENTIFICATION OF PATTERNS

Earth not generating Metal

The clinical manifestations are phlegm in the chest, 
cough and tiredness.

This pattern describes the situation when a Spleen 
deficiency (causing the tiredness) leads to the forma-
tion of Phlegm, which obstructs the Lungs.

Metal not generating Water

The clinical manifestations are cough, breathlessness, 
loss of voice and asthma.

This pattern corresponds to the Internal Organ 
pattern of Kidneys not receiving Qi.

Water not generating Wood

The clinical manifestations are dizziness, blurred 
vision, headaches and vertigo.

This pattern is the same as the Internal Organ 
pattern of Kidney- and Liver-Yin deficiency.

### RIGHT COLUMN

OVERACTING SEQUENCE PATTERNS

Wood overacting on Earth

The clinical manifestations are hypochondriac and epi-
gastric pain, a feeling of distension, irritability, loose 
stools, poor appetite and greenish face.

When the clinical manifestations pertain to one 
Element and the face colour pertains to the Element 
which overacts on it, the face colour usually shows  
the origin of the disharmony. In this case, loose  
stools and poor appetite are symptoms of deficiency of 
Earth (Spleen) but the face is greenish: this indicates 
that the root of the problem is in Wood, i.e. Wood  
overacting on Earth. This same principle applies to all 
the following cases of disharmony of the Overacting 
sequence.

The pattern of Wood overacting on Earth is very 
common and it is exactly the same as the pattern of 
‘Liver invading the Spleen’ already discussed (ch. 34).

Earth overacting on Water

The main clinical manifestations are oedema, difficult 
urination and a yellow face.

This pattern occurs when a deficient Spleen fails to 
transform and transport fluids which accumulate and 
obstruct the Kidney function of transformation and 
excretion of fluids.

Water overacting on Fire

The clinical manifestations are oedema of the ankles, 
backache, feeling cold, dizziness, expectoration of thin 
watery sputum, palpitations.

This pattern corresponds to the pattern of Kidney-
Yang deficient Water overflowing to the Heart.

Fire overacting on Metal

The clinical manifestations are cough with profuse 
yellow sputum, a feeling of heat and a red face.

This pattern corresponds to Full-Heat in the Lungs.

Metal overacting on Wood

The clinical manifestations are tiredness, irritability, a 
feeling of distension, cough and a white face.

This pattern corresponds to a situation when the 
lack of descending of Lung-Qi impairs the free flow of 
Liver-Qi.

INSULTING SEQUENCE PATTERNS

### LEFT COLUMN

Wood insulting Metal

The clinical manifestations are cough, asthma and a 
feeling of distension of chest and hypochondrium.

The Liver channel influences the chest and stagnant 
Liver-Qi or Liver-Fire can obstruct the chest and prevent 
Lung-Qi from descending.

Metal insulting Fire

The clinical manifestations are palpitations, insomnia 
and breathlessness.

This pattern basically describes a condition of both 
Lung- and Heart-Qi deficiency.

Fire insulting Water

The clinical manifestations are a malar flush, dry 
mouth at night, insomnia, dizziness, lower backache 
and night sweating.

This pattern is identical to the Internal Organ pattern 
of ‘Kidney and Heart not harmonized’, i.e. Kidney-Yin 
deficiency giving rise to Heart Empty-Heat.

Water insulting Earth

The clinical manifestations are loose stools, oedema, 
tiredness and weakness of the limbs.

This pattern corresponds to Spleen- and Kidney-
Yang deficiency.

Earth insulting Wood

The clinical manifestations are jaundice and hypo-
chondriac pain and distension.

This pattern is caused by a failure of the Spleen in 
transforming fluids, leading to Dampness. Dampness 
accumulates and obstructs the smooth flow of Liver-Qi, 
impeding the free flow of bile.

Identification of Patterns According to the Five Elements

Self-assessment questions

1. Which organ pattern corresponds to the pattern of Wood

not generating Fire?
2. Describe the symptoms and their pathology caused when

Earth does not generate Metal.
3. Identify the following clinical manifestations in terms of

their Five-Element sequence pattern: dizziness, blurred 
vision, headaches and vertigo.
4. If a patient has multiple symptoms involving the Lungs, but

has a yellow face, where do you suspect lies the origin of 
the disharmony?
5. Which Internal Organ pattern corresponds to the pattern of

Fire insulting Water?
