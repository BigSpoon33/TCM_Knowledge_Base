The pattern identification according to the channels is 
the oldest of the pattern identification methods. It is 
found in the ‘Spiritual Axis’ in chapter 10.1

Basically, this method of pattern identification allows 
us to distinguish symptoms and signs according to the 
involved channel: it is therefore concerned with the 
pathological changes occurring in the channel rather 
than the organ.

After discussing the pathology of organ versus that 
of channels, I shall list the clinical manifestations of 
the pathology of Main (Jing Mai), Connecting (Luo Mai) 
and Muscle channels (Jing Jin).

Organ versus channel

The organs and their relevant channels form an indi-
visible energetic unit: problems of the Internal Organs

can affect the relevant channels and, conversely, prob-
lems that start as channel problems can penetrate into 
the Interior and be transmitted to the organs.

It is important, however, to appreciate both the unity 
and the separation between the organ and the channel. 
They form a unity, but they are also energetically sepa-
rate: the channels pertain to what is called the Exterior, 
i.e. the superficial energetic layers of the body (includ-
ing skin and muscles), and the organs pertain to the 
Interior, i.e. the deep energetic layer of the body, includ-
ing the organs and bones.

In disease, there can be problems of the channels  
not affecting the organs and vice versa. It is very 
important to appreciate (and be able to identify) when 
a problem is situated in the Exterior and affecting the 
channels only.

For example, if a person has a pain in the shoulder 
along the Large Intestine channel without any Large 
Intestine organ symptoms, one can safely conclude 
that this is a channel problem only, not affecting the 
Internal Organs. If, on the contrary, a person suffers 
from chronic diarrhoea over a long period of time with 
mucus and blood in the stools and, after some years, 
develops a pain in the shoulder along the Large Intes-
tine channel, then this channel problem is possibly 
caused by its corresponding Internal Organ disease. 
However, even in this case there could be an overlap of 
an Internal Organ problem with a separate invasion of 
an exterior pathogenic factor in the channel.

The channels and their relevant Internal Organs  
can be compared, respectively, to the branches and the 
roots of a tree (Fig. 47.1). The branches of a tree may 
be damaged by hail, broken by wind, or wither from 
excessive heat and dryness but these events will not 
affect the roots of the tree: this would correspond to a 
channel problem in the human body. Conversely, if the 
soil is very poor and the roots do not derive enough 
nutrients and suffer, this would correspond to a Inter-
nal Organ problem in the human body.

Figure 47.1  Internal Organs and channels

Channel problems can arise from four factors:
First of all, they arise from invasion of exterior path-
ogenic factors, such as Cold, Wind, or Dampness. These 
invade the Connecting (Luo) channels first, and then 
the main channels, settling in the joints and causing 
Painful Obstruction Syndrome (Bi Syndrome). This is 
an extremely frequent cause of channel problems 
which affects most people at one time or another.

IDENTIFICATION OF PATTERNS

Channel pathology is, in fact, closely related to joint 
pathology. Joints in Chinese medicine are more than 
just anatomical entities: they have an important func-
tion with regard to the circulation of Qi and Blood, 
with several implications in pathology.

Joints are places where Qi and Blood concentrate  
or gather, and they are also the places where Qi goes 
from the Interior to the Exterior or vice versa. As will 
be remembered from chapter 4, Qi has complex direc-
tions of movement, upwards and downwards and in 
and out, constituting the ascending/descending and 
entering/exiting of Qi, respectively. The joints are the 
places along the channels where Qi enters and exits. It 
is not by chance that many of the major Transporting 
(Shu) points of the limbs below elbows and knees are 
situated on joints. As a consequence of this concentra-
tion of Qi, the joints are the places where a pathogenic 
factor easily settles.

When a pathogenic factor invades the joint, it alters 
the balance of Yin and Yang, upsets the circulation  
of Qi in the channel and causes Qi and Blood to

796


### RIGHT COLUMN

stagnate: this causes pain and in the long run gives rise 
to Painful Obstruction Syndrome (Bi Syndrome). If the 
pathogenic factor is associated with Heat, the joint will 
feel hot; if it is associated with Cold, it will feel cold; if 
there is Dampness, the joint is swollen; if there is Wind, 
the pain moves from joint to joint.

Besides being affected by exterior pathogenic factors, 
joints are affected by general deficiency of Qi and 
Blood, which may cause their lack of nourishment and 
hence weakness.

Another frequent cause of channel problems is from 
overuse of a limb or part of the body, giving rise to local 
stagnation of Qi. Anyone who, because of their work 
circumstances, has to constantly repeat the same 
movements, will be liable to suffer from channel prob-
lems, manifesting with local stagnation of Qi. This is a 
very common cause of repetitive strain injury.

Sports injuries are another frequent cause of channel 
problems, causing local stagnation of Qi in the channel.

Finally, channel problems can, of course, spring from 
Internal Organ disharmonies.

The channel pattern identification describes the 
pathological changes occurring in channels. However, 
although this is the main aim of this pattern identifica-
tion, it can be slightly confusing as the symptoms and 
signs described in the ‘Spiritual Axis’ also include some 
from the relevant organ and sometimes even from 
other organs.

For example, among the Lung channel symptoms 
and signs are:

• Congested and sore throat, sensation of fullness in the

chest, pain in the clavicle and arm, which are due to the 
Lung channel
• Cough and asthma, which are due to the Lung organ
• Pain in the shoulders and upper back, which is due to

the Large Intestine channel, to which the Lung channel  
is related

Thus channel patterns include some symptoms and 
signs from the organs themselves. These can safely be 
ignored, as for organ problems one would much rather 
use Internal Organ pattern identification. For example, 
‘cough’ and ‘asthma’ are not sufficiently specific to give 
an indication of the possible pattern involved. In order 
to do so, it is necessary to use Internal Organ pattern 
identification, which gives a more precise account of 
the picture formed by the pattern. For example, if


============================================================
### Page 826
============================================================

### LEFT COLUMN

cough is accompanied by profuse white sputum with a 
feeling of oppression of the chest and the tongue has a 
sticky white thick coating, we know that the pattern 
involved is Damp-Phlegm obstructing the Lungs. If the 
cough is dry and there is night sweating with a feeling 
of heat in the chest, soles and palms, we know that the 
pattern in question is deficiency of Lung-Yin.

However, we must also remember that a channel 
problem can affect the orifices and sense organs and 
that such problems are not always related to the Inter-
nal Organs. For example, the Kidneys open into the 
ears but not every ear problem is related to the Kidneys. 
In fact, Triple Burner channel symptoms include pain 
in the ear and deafness. By this is obviously meant a 
pain in the ear and deafness of acute onset, probably 
from invasion of exterior Wind-Heat, as deafness with 
a slow onset would most probably be due to a Kidney 
deficiency. Liver channel symptoms include blurred 
vision and tinnitus. Thus, not all sense organ problems 
are related to Internal Organ diseases.

The channel pattern identification is important to 
identify the affected channel from the symptoms and 
signs. The clinical manifestations related to the channel 
itself are therefore more important.

Of course, the channel pattern identification needs 
to be based on a thorough knowledge of the main 
channels and their deep pathways.2

Apart from this, one must also distinguish Full from 
Empty conditions of the channels. Full conditions are 
characterized by intense pain, stiffness, contractions 
and cramps. Empty conditions are characterized by 
dull ache, weakness of the muscles, atrophy of the 
muscles and numbness.

Fullness and Emptiness of the channels can also be 
differentiated from the colour appearing along the 
course of the channel and its temperature to the touch. 
In Full conditions there may be a red colour indicating 
Heat or a bluish colour, indicating Cold. In the case of 
Heat, it would also feel hot to the touch. In Empty con-
ditions, there may be a pale streak along the course of 
the channel and this would feel cold to the touch.

To summarize, if we know the pathway of the chan-
nels thoroughly and are able to identify Full or Empty 
conditions of the channels according to the above 
guidelines, any clinical manifestation appearing along 
the channel can be correctly identified.3

The following is a list of the channel patterns from 
chapter 10 of the ‘Spiritual Axis’. For the sake of 
clarity, I have omitted the symptoms and signs of
