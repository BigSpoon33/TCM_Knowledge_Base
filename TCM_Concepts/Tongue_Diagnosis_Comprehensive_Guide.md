    INTRODUCTION
   Tongue diagnosis is a very important part of diagnosis by observation. The
strength of tongue diagnosis lies in its clarity and objectivity. Especially when
compared with pulse diagnosis, tongue diagnosis is quite objective: when a
tongue is too Red or too Pale, this can be observed objectively. Another
important strength of tongue diagnosis is its capacity to shed light on
complicated conditions. For example, a simultaneous deficiency of Kidney-Yin
and Kidney-Yang is quite common in women over 40 and especially in
menopausal women. This simultaneous deficiency can give rise to confusing hot
and cold manifestations: the tongue will indicate quite clearly whether there is a
predominance of Kidney-Yang or Kidney-Yin deficiency.
   The principal aspects of tongue diagnosis are the tongue-body colour, the
tongue-body shape and the coating. The tongue reflects the state of the Internal
Organs and that of Qi and Blood. From the Eight-Principle point of view, it
clearly reflects Heat-Cold, Full-Empty and Yin-Yang conditions.

  CONDITIONS FOR EXAMINING THE
TONGUE
Lighting
   Proper lighting is absolutely essential for a correct examination of the tongue
and the only good lighting is natural light on a sunny day. The room where the
patient is examined should have an abundant source of natural light; for
example, no proper natural light can ever be achieved in a basement. Even in
daylight, the colour of the tongue can be interpreted properly indoors only if the
day is sunny. On a cloudy day the colour of the tongue cannot be accurately
observed indoors; if the patient is examined on such a day, it is advisable when
observing the tongue to ask the patient to stand next to a window or even
outdoors. Obviously, it is seldom possible to achieve ideal conditions. If it is
necessary to observe the tongue on a cloudy day or in the afternoon or evening, I
find that the best artificial light is that of a halogen bulb and the best way to
observe the tongue is by means of a table lamp fi ed with one of these bulbs.
    Techniques Of Observation Of The Tongue
   One should not ask the patient to hold the tongue out for longer than
approximately 15 seconds because the longer the tongue is extended the darker
it will tend to become. If we need longer than 15 seconds to observe the tongue,
which we normally do, we should ask the patient to withdraw the tongue, close
the mouth and extend the tongue again; this can be done several times without
aﬀecting its body colour.
   It is very important to examine the tongue systematically following always
the same order, which should be as follows:

         • tongue-body colour
         • tongue-body shape
         • coating
         • tongue spirit.
   I would strongly recommend following this systematic order of observation
of the tongue because the above order reflects the relative clinical importance of
each item. For example, the tongue-body colour reflects conditions of Heat or
Cold and deficiency of Yin or Yang in various organs, and especially the Yin
organs; it should therefore be always the first aspect to be observed. The tongue-
body shape often simply adds information to that gleaned from observation of
the tongue-body colour; for example, if the tongue is Pale from Yang deficiency,
its swelling will simply indicate that the Yang deficiency is particularly
pronounced. The tongue coating reflects more the condition of the Yang organs
and it is easily influenced by short-term factors, which makes it relatively less
important than observation of the tongue-body colour in chronic conditions.

    External Factors Affecting The Colour Of The
Tongue
   The most obvious external factors aﬀecting the colour of the tongue are
highly coloured foods, sweets, drinks or pastilles. If a patient's tongue has a very
obvious, unusual, bright colour, always ask what he or she has been eating.
   Spicy foods such as cayenne pepper and curry may tend to make the tongue
slightly redder soon after consumption. Tobacco smoking usually colours the
coating yellow, and in regular smokers this is permanent. However, this cannot
be wri en oﬀ as no more than a false appearance due to an external factor; in
fact, tobacco, which has a hot energy, will tend to create Heat.

    Medicines
   Some medicines aﬀect the appearance of the tongue and the most common
ones are antibiotics. These tend to make the tongue partially peeled, that is, the
loss of small patches of coating. Therefore, when I see such a tongue, the first
thing I ask is whether the patient is on antibiotics or has taken them recently
(Fig. 23.1 ). In my experience, the eﬀect of the antibiotics on the tongue lasts for
about 2 weeks after stopping the course. Judging from the eﬀects of antibiotics
on the tongue, we can deduce that they injure Stomach-Yin.

   Oral corticosteroids tend to make the tongue Red and Swollen, while inhaled
bronchodilators (such as salbutamol) may cause the tip of the tongue to become
Red, but only after many years of use.
   Anti-inflammatory drugs such as phenylbutazone paradoxically cause the
tongue to develop red points.
   Most cytotoxic drugs used for cancer tend to create a very thick, dark-yellow
or brown coating and also to make the tongue-body Red.

    AREAS OF THE TONGUE
   In men and women alike, the tongue-body can be divided into three areas:
the rear corresponding to the Lower Burner, the middle to the Middle Burner
and the front to the Upper Burner (Fig. 23.2 ).

                                                                     1   l ow er Burner

      FIG. 23.2   Divisions of the tongue according to the Three Burners
   Therefore, according to this division, the front third of the tongue reflects the
state of the Heart and Lungs, the middle third that of the Stomach, Spleen, Liver
and Gall-Bladder and the rear third that of the Kidneys, Bladder and Intestines.
Figure 23.3 illustrates the areas corresponding to the Internal Organs in detail.

   The relative position of the Heart and Lung areas on the tongue should be
explained in relation to redness, swelling, cracks or Purple colour.
   When there is Lung-Heat, this will make the whole front of the tongue Red
including the Heart area (even though the Heat is only in the Lungs and not in
the Heart) (Fig. 23.4 ); when there is Heart-Heat only the tip of the tongue
becomes Red (Fig. 23.5 ).

   As far as swelling is concerned, a swelling of the tip itself indicates a Heart
pathology, usually Heart-Heat. (Fig. 23.6 ). A Lung-related swelling usually
appears either in the whole front third (Fig. 23.7 ) or on the sides between the
Heart area and the Stomach and Spleen area (Fig. 23.8 ).

   As far as cracks are concerned, Lung cracks are usually located in the area
between the tip and the centre (Fig. 23.9 ).

      FIG. 23.9    Lung cracks
   A Purple colour on the sides of the tongue between the tip and centre may be
related to the Lungs or Heart. It indicates Blood stasis and, in lung disease, it is
seen in chronic asthma or emphysema, while in heart disease it is seen in
coronary heart disease or angina. The Purple patch may be unilateral or bilateral
(Fig. 23.10 ). In women, in addition, a Purple colour in that area may also
indicate a breast pathology.

   Although the sides of the tongue correspond to Liver and Gall-Bladder, they
may also, under certain circumstances, reflect conditions of the Spleen. A
pathology of the Liver, such as Heat, is reflected along the whole side of the
tongue, while one of the Spleen is also reflected on the sides but only in the
central section. This applies to both redness and swelling, and Figures 23.11 and
23.12 illustrate this diﬀerence.

  CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
TONGUE
   The importance of tongue diagnosis lies mostly in the fact that it nearly
always shows the true condition of the patient; this is, of course, most useful in
complicated conditions when there may be contradictory signs of Heat and Cold
or of Yin and Yang deficiency. For example, in menopausal conditions, when
there is often a simultaneous deficiency of Kidney-Yin and Kidney-Yang and
contradictory symptoms of Heat and Cold, the tongue clearly shows whether
there is a predominance of Yin or Yang deficiency as it will be Red in the former
case and Pale in the la er.
   The clinical significance of the tongue must be related to its various aspects as
follows.

     Tongue-Body Colour
   The tongue-body colour reflects primarily the state of the Yin organs and
Blood and it shows conditions of Heat or Cold and of Yin or Yang deficiency.
   The tongue body's own colour is visible through the tongue coating and it is
important not to confuse the two. Generally speaking, the tongue coating does
not extend right to the edge of the tongue and therefore the sides of the tongue
can show us the tongue-body colour if the coating is very thick. Observation of
the tongue-body colour includes that of red points, which usually, but not
always, occur on a Red tongue.
   Examination of the body colour should also always include an examination
of the veins under the tongue.
   The normal Stomach fluids tend to make the tongue Pale whereas Heart-
Blood tends to redden it; the influence of these two organs therefore causes the
normal tongue to be Pale Red indicating a good state of Stomach fluids and
Heart-Blood.

     Tongue-Body Shape
   The tongue-body shape reflects primarily conditions of Deficiency or Excess
and observation of it adds more information to that gleaned from the tongue-
body colour.
    Observation of the tongue-body shape includes consideration of the shape
itself: its thickness (Thin, Swollen, etc.), its suppleness (Stiﬀ, Flabby, etc.), its
surface (cracks, etc.), and its involuntary movements (Quivering, Moving, etc.).
    The normal tongue-body shape is supple, not Swollen, not Thin and without
cracks.

     Tongue Coating
    The tongue coating reflects primarily the state of the Yang organs and
especially of the Stomach. It also reflects conditions of Deficiency or Excess and
of Heat or Cold.
    The tongue coating is formed when some of the fluids generated in the
process of the Stomach's digestion of food flow up and create its coating. A thin,
white tongue coating, therefore, indicates a good state of Stomach-Qi while a
rootless or an absent tongue coating indicates weakening of Stomach-Qi.
    The tongue coating should be thin enough for the tongue-body colour to be
seen through it.

     Tongue Spirit
    The tongue "spirit" refers to the general appearance of the tongue: this is
called shen in Chinese and it is much the same as the shen of the complexion and
eyes, (i.e. referring to the qualities of brightness, sheen and vitality). One can
therefore distinguish two types of tongue: one with spirit, the other without
spirit.
    A tongue with spirit denotes certain qualities of liveliness, suppleness,
vitality and brightness of the tongue-body; a tongue without spirit looks lifeless,
rather stiﬀ, rather dark and dull.
    A tongue without spirit denotes a poor prognosis or that the condition is
more diﬃcult to treat.
    For a detailed discussion of tongue diagnosis see "Tongue Diagnosis in
Chinese Medicine". 1

     TONGUE SPIRIT
    The tongue "spirit" refers to the general appearance of the tongue: this is
called shen in Chinese and it is much the same as the shen of the complexion and
eyes, that is, referring to the qualities of brightness, sheen and vitality. One can
therefore distinguish two types of tongue: one with spirit, the other without
spirit.
    A tongue with spirit denotes certain qualities of liveliness, suppleness,
vitality and brightness of the tongue body; a tongue without spirit looks lifeless,
rather stiﬀ, rather dark and dull. One can use the analogy of a piece of meat in a
butcher's shop: the tongue with spirit looks like a fresh piece of meat, while the
tongue without spirit looks like an old piece of meat which has become dark,
greyish and lifeless.
    The spirit should be observed in particular on the root of the tongue because
the root reflects the state of the Kidneys and the spirit of this area reflects the
condition of the Kidney-Essence. The Kidney-Essence is the foundation of life
and the absence of spirit on the root of the tongue indicates a severe deficiency of
the Kidneys and therefore the tendency to ill health. The tongue spirit is basically
a prognostic sign as a tongue with spirit indicates that the patient may recover
relatively easily whereas a tongue without spirit indicates that, whatever the
patient may suﬀer from, the treatment may be prolonged.
    It is important to remember that the tongue spirit has nothing to do with
other pathological signs on the tongue; in other words, the patient may have a
tongue that is pathological in many respects (e.g. Red with a thick coating), but if
it has spirit this indicates that the Kidney-Essence is still strong and that the
body can fight oﬀ pathogenic factors.

     TONGUE-BODY COLOURS
   The tongue-body colour reflects primarily the state of the Yin organs and
Blood and it shows conditions of Heat or Cold and of Yin or Yang deficiency.
The normal body colour is pale red. Traditionally five pathological colours are
described, that is, Pale, Red, Dark-Red, Purple and Blue. However, the clinical
significance of the Dark-Red tongue is essentially the same as that of the Red
tongue and the clinical significance of the Blue tongue is essentially the same as
that of the Bluish-Purple tongue: therefore, the pathological colours may be
narrowed down to three: Pale, Red and Purple.

     Pale
   The Pale tongue is paler than normal. The pallor ranges from a very slight
paleness to a paleness so extreme that the tongue is almost white. (See Plate 24.1
on p. P22 )
   The Pale tongue indicates either Yang deficiency or Blood deficiency; in Yang
deficiency it will tend to be slightly wet, whereas in Blood deficiency it will tend
to be slightly dry. The la er is much more common in women. If it is only
slightly Pale this may also indicate Qi deficiency.
   The tongue is often Pale only on the sides. If the pallor is all along the sides
this indicates Liver-Blood deficiency; if it is only in the central section it indicates
Spleen-Blood deficiency. In severe cases of Liver-Blood deficiency the sides may
also become orangey.
   The Pale tongue normally has a coating, and a Pale tongue without coating
indicates severe Blood deficiency; this is relatively rare and it is usually seen only
in women.
   Box 24.1 summarizes the pa erns underlying a Pale tongue.

          BOX 24.1         PALE TONGUE
          • Pale and slightly wet: Yang deficiency
          • Pale and slightly dry: Blood deficiency
          • Slightly pale; Qi deficiency
          • Pale on the sides all along edges: Liver-Blood deficiency
          • Pale on the sides in central section: Spleen-Blood deficiency
          • Pale-orangey or pale without coating: severe Liver-Blood
      deficiency

     Red
   The Red tongue is redder than the normal colour. Although traditionally two
shades are described (i.e. Red or Dark-Red), the clinical significance of these two
is essentially the same. (See Plate 24.2 on p. P22 .)
   A Red tongue always indicates Heat, which may be Full or Empty. Therefore,
when we observe a Red tongue the first thing we should ask ourselves is
whether it has a coating or not. If the tongue is Red with a coating with root
(whatever its colour) this indicates Full-Heat; if the tongue is Red without a
coating, or coated only partially, or with a rootless coating (whatever its colour),
it indicates Empty-Heat.
   It should be stressed that a Red tongue without coating indicates specifically
Empty-Heat rather than Yin deficiency, although obviously it arises from the
la er. In other words, it is the lack of coating that indicates the Yin deficiency
and the redness (without coating) that indicates Empty-Heat. The implication of
this is, of course, that there are many tongue types that indicate Yin deficiency
while the tongue-body is not Red.
   Box 24.2 summarizes the pa erns underlying Red tongue and tongue coating.

            BOX 24.2        RED TONGUE AND TONGUE
      COATING
            • Red tongue with coating: Full-Heat
            • Red tongue without coating: Empty-Heat
            • Normal tongue without coating: Yin deficiency
   The tongue-body may be Red in specific areas, especially the tip, the front
third, the centre or the sides. A Red tip of the tongue (Fig. 24.1 ) indicates Heart-
Heat (Full or Empty); if the tip only is Red, this indicates that the condition of
Heart-Heat is slight, whereas if the whole tongue is Red and the tip redder it
indicates that there is generalized Heat and severe Heart-Heat. (See Plate 24.3 on
p. P22 .)

      FIG. 24.1   Red tip
   Red sides all along the edge indicate Liver-Heat (Fig. 24.2 , see also Plate 24.4
on p. P22 ), while a redness on the sides only in the central section indicates
either Stomach-Heat or Spleen-Heat (Fig. 24.3 ).

   If the tongue is Red in the centre it indicates Stomach-Heat (Fig. 24.4 ); if it is
Red in the front third (including the tip) it indicates Lung-Heat (Fig. 24.5 ).

      FIG. 24.4   Stomach-Heat

      FIG. 24.5   Lung-Heat

     Red points
   Before defining red points, we should define the red "grains". Ancient
Chinese books on tongue diagnosis say that the physiological Minister Fire
ascending to communicate with the Heart forms red grains on the surface of the
tongue (bearing in mind that the tongue is the oﬀshoot of the Heart). These red
grains are normal and indicate that the physiological Minister Fire is in a healthy
state, that is, it is neither excessive nor deficient. When the Minister Fire becomes
pathological from various life influences, it flares upwards causing the red grains
to become redder and to protrude from the surface of the tongue so that they
become more visible: when this happens they are called red "points". Therefore
red points are always pathological and they indicate a pathological state of the
Minister Fire flaring upwards. Red points always indicate Heat to a degree
greater than when the tongue is just Red. The intensity of their colour and their
distribution clearly correlate with the intensity of the Heat: the more intense the
colour and the more dense the distribution, the stronger is the Heat. (See Plate
24.5 on p. P22 .)
   Red "spots" look the same as red points except that they are larger and they
are usually seen only on the root of the tongue. Like red points, red spots also
indicate Heat but with the additional component of some Blood stasis.
   Red points are frequently seen on the tip, sides, centre or root of the tongue.
Red points on the tip are relatively common and they indicate Heart-Fire,
usually deriving from emotional stress. Red points on the sides in the Liver area
indicate Liver-Heat (Liver-Fire), whereas red points in the centre indicate
Stomach-Heat (Fig. 24.6 ). However, Stomach-Heat may also be reflected in red
points on the sides but only in the middle section of the tongue and along a
broader strip.

                                                               Stomach.Heat
      FIG. 24.6   Red points indicating Liver-Heat or Stomach-Heat
   With Lung-Heat, red points may appear either in the chest area or in the
whole front third of the tongue, as opposed to the very tip as in the case of
Heart-Heat (Fig. 24.7 ).

      FIG. 24.7   Red points indicating Lung-Heat
   Red points on the root indicate Heat, usually Damp-Heat, in the Bladder or
Intestines.

     Red points in external diseases
   The significance of red points in external diseases is diﬀerent from that in
internal diseases. First of all, red points in acute external diseases definitely
indicate an invasion of Wind-Heat as opposed to Wind-Cold.
   In external diseases the density of the red points reflects not only the
intensity of the pathogenic factor but also its progression towards the Interior;
thus if, in the course of an acute external disease, the red points become denser
this indicates not only that the pathogenic factor has become stronger but that it
is beginning to penetrate into the Interior.
   The distribution of the red points also reflects the stages of penetration of an
external pathogenic factor. In the very beginning stages of an invasion of
external Wind, the red points may be more concentrated on the front third or on
the sides. In this context, these two areas correspond to the Exterior of the body
while the centre of the tongue corresponds to the Interior (Fig. 24.8 ).

                                                                      Exte rior
                                  Exterior

      FIG. 24.8   Areas corresponding to Interior and Exterior in acute, external diseases
   Thus if after a few days, the red points from these two areas extend towards
the centre of the tongue, it indicates that a pathogenic factor is penetrating into
the Interior.
   Box 24.3 summarizes the pa erns underlying red points on the tongue.

     Purple
   A Purple tongue always indicates Blood stasis, which itself may derive from
Cold or from Heat. (See Plates 24.6 , 24.7 and 25.3 on pp. P22, P23 and P24 .)
Internal Cold contracts and obstructs the circulation of Blood, leading to Blood
stasis; Heat leads to Blood stasis by condensing the Body Fluids and Blood.
When Blood stasis derives from Cold, the tongue is Bluish-Purple while when it
derives from Heat, it is Reddish-Purple. Therefore the Bluish-Purple tongue
indicating Cold derives from a Pale tongue while the Reddish-Purple tongue
derives from a Red tongue (Fig. 24.9 ).

      FIG. 24.9    Development of Bluish-Purple or Reddish-Purple tongue
   A tongue becomes Purple only after a prolonged time, usually years:
therefore it always indicates a chronic condition and for this reason it is far more
common in the elderly. The Purple colour of the tongue indicates potentially
serious conditions and in the presence of such tongue-body colour we should
always invigorate Blood and eliminate stasis (as well as expelling internal Cold
in the case of Blood stasis deriving from Cold and clearing Heat in the case of
Blood stasis deriving from Heat), even in the absence of any symptom of Blood
stasis. Serious conditions relating to Blood stasis in Chinese medicine include
cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke and hypertension.
   The tongue can be only partially Purple and the most common areas are the
sides (Liver or chest area) of the tongue, the centre and the front third; the most
frequent occurrence is on the sides in the Liver area. Strangely, the tongue is
never Purple on the tip only and Blood stasis in the Heart usually manifests in
the chest/breast area instead (see below).
   A Purple colour on the sides in the Liver area (Fig. 24.10 ) indicates Blood
stasis in the Liver, which may occur in any of the areas influenced by the Liver
channel, for example Liver-Blood stasis in the hypochondrium, epigastrium,
lower abdomen and Uterus. (See Plate 24.8 on p. P23 .) It is interesting to note
that, although the Uterus is in the Lower Burner, whose state is reflected in the
back third of the tongue, Blood stasis in the Uterus is manifested with a Purple
colour not on the root of the tongue but on the sides in the Liver area.

      FIG. 24.10    Liver area
   A Purple colour on the sides in the chest area (Fig. 24.11 ) indicates Blood
stasis in the chest (which may include Heart or Lungs) or, in women only, the
breasts. In lung diseases, a Purple colour in the chest area is seen in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease such as chronic asthma, bronchitis or
emphysema. In heart diseases, a Purple colour in the chest area is seen in
coronary heart disease. In addition, in women a Purple colour in the chest/breast
area may indicate a breast pathology such as breast lumps, whether benign or
malignant. Observation of the breast area in women suﬀering from carcinoma of
the breast is an important prognostic factor because if this area is clearly Purple
the prognosis is poor, whereas if it is not the prognosis is good. A Purple colour
in the breast area is also sometimes seen in women without any breast
pathology; this may indicate the predisposition to breast lumps and one should
therefore invigorate Blood and eliminate stasis in the breasts even in the absence
of symptoms and signs. (See Plate 24.9 on p. P23 .)

      FIG. 24.11   Breast/chest areas
   A Purple colour in the centre of the tongue indicates Blood stasis in the
Stomach, whereas a Purple colour in the front third indicates Blood stasis in the
Lungs.
   Box 24.4 summarizes pa erns underlying Purple tongue areas.

           BOX 24.4            PURPLE AREAS ON THE
      TONGUE
          • Liver areas: Liver-Blood stasis or Blood stasis in the Uterus
          • Breast/chest areas: Blood stasis in the Heart or breast
          • Centre: Blood stasis in the Stomach

    SUBLINGUAL VEINS
   The sublingual veins should always form part of a routine examination of the
tongue body. Under normal conditions, the two veins under the tongue are
barely visible and they have a very faint, pale-red colour. When they become
clearly visible, they are by definition pathological. (See Plate 24.10 on p. P23 .)
One should observe the size and the colour of the sublingual veins.
   If the veins are distended but not dark, this indicates Qi deficiency, if they are
too thin in relation to the sides of the tongue and the patient's body itself, this
indicates Yin deficiency.
   The most important sign with regard to sublingual veins is their Purple
colour. If they are distended and dark Purple, this indicates Blood stasis, usually
in the Upper Burner (Lungs or Heart) but it may also refer to the Liver.
Distended and dark sublingual veins are more common in the elderly and they
give an early indication of Blood stasis before the rest of the tongue body
becomes Purple. Observation of the sublingual veins therefore has an important
preventative value. Dark and dry sublingual veins indicate severe Yin deficiency
with Empty-Heat. Dark, swollen and wet veins indicate Lung, Spleen and
Kidney deficiency with accumulation of fluids.
   Such observation is important also in chronic Painful Obstruction Syndrome.
If the sublingual veins are reddish and shiny, they indicate Damp-Heat; if they
are yellowish, Dampness, while if they are white and slippery, Cold-Dampness,
and if they are swollen, white and sticky, Dampness and Blood stasis.

         • dark-purple: hardening of the brain arteries
         • distended, dark and crooked: hardening of arteries,
      hypertension (if the veins protrude a lot and look like earthworms,
      the disease is severe)
         • small nodules like rice or wheat grains: hardening of arteries
      and heart disease.
   In modern China, some doctors consider the appearance of sublingual veins
as a useful prodromal sign of certain diseases. 1 The main signs are as follows:

     INTRODUCTION
   Observation of the tongue-body shape reveals primarily conditions of
Deficiency or Excess and it adds more information to that gleaned from
observation of the tongue-body colour. For example, a Pale tongue may indicate
Yang deficiency, but if, in addition to being Pale, it is also very Swollen this
indicates that the Yang deficiency is severe and that it has led to the
accumulation of Dampness or Phlegm. In this example, the tongue-body shape
reflects the Full condition generated by Dampness or Phlegm.
   To give another example, if a tongue lacks coating, this indicates Yin
deficiency, but if in addition it is also very thin it indicates that the Yin deficiency
is quite severe. In this example, the tongue-body shape reflects the severity of a
deficiency condition. To give yet another example, if the tip of the tongue is Red
this indicates Heart-Heat or Heart-Fire usually deriving from emotional
problems, but if the tip is also swollen it indicates that a condition of Heart-Heat
or Heart-Fire is more severe.

     THIN
   "Thin" refers to the thickness, not the width, of the tongue. The "body" of the
tongue is formed by fluids and Blood and a Thin tongue therefore always
indicates a deficiency either of Blood or of Yin fluids. In the former case, it will
also be Pale while in the la er case it will be Red.
   A Thin tongue is actually not common, probably because Dampness and
Phlegm, which make the tongue Swollen, are such common and predominant
pathogenic factors. As they tend to make the tongue Swollen, even if the patient
has a concurrent severe Blood deficiency, this would not manifest on the tongue-
body shape. In my practice, for example, out of 2378 patients, less than 2% have
a Thin tongue while nearly 37% have a Swollen tongue.

     SWOLLEN
   The size of the tongue body has to be related to the size of the head of the
person: what might be "Swollen" for someone may be normal for another. (See
Plate 25.1 on p. P23 .) As the thickness of the tongue body depends on the supply
of fluids and Blood, a Swollen tongue body indicates an accumulation of fluids,
which may be Dampness, Phlegm or oedema. Thus a swelling of the tongue
always indicates a Full condition and particularly one characterized by
Dampness or Phlegm. Although Dampness and Phlegm usually arise from a Qi
or a Yang deficiency, the swelling of the tongue body reflects the Full condition
created by these two pathogenic factors.

     PARTIALLY SWOLLEN
   While a total swelling of the tongue always indicates Dampness or Phlegm, a
partial swelling may indicate other pathologies such as Qi deficiency, Qi
stagnation or Heat. The areas where a partial swelling is most commonly seen
are the sides in the Liver or chest area, the tip and the front third.
   A swelling on the sides in the Liver area (Fig. 25.1 ) is very common and it
usually indicates Liver-Heat; it is nearly always associated with a Red colour in
the same area.

      FIG. 25.1   Swelling in the Liver area
   A swelling on the sides in the chest/breast area (Fig. 25.2 ) generally indicates
either retention of Phlegm in the chest or breast or Lung-Qi deficiency.
      FIG. 25.2   Swelling in the chest/breast area
   A swelling of the tip of the tongue (Fig. 25.3 ), usually associated with a Red
colour, is very common and it indicates Heart-Heat or Heart-Fire deriving from
severe emotional problems.

      FIG. 25.3   Swelling of the tip of the tongue
   A swelling of the front third of the tongue (Fig. 25.4 ) indicates retention of
Phlegm in the Lungs. (See Plate 25.2 on p. P23 .)

      FIG. 25.4   Swelling of the front third of the tongue

     STIFF
   A Stiﬀ tongue lacks the normal suppleness and flexibility. It looks hard and
stiﬀ. It indicates internal Wind, Blood stasis or severe Yin deficiency. (See Plate
25.3 on p. P24 .)

     FLACCID
   A flaccid tongue is flabby and, in severe cases, it has a crumpled look. It
always indicates lack of Body Fluids or Blood.

     LONG
   A Long tongue is rather narrow and, when extended, protrudes further than
normal. Not commonly seen, it always indicates Heat.

     SHORT
   A Short tongue appears to be contracted and the patient is unable to extend it
out of the mouth cavity. The significance of the Short tongue depends on the
body colour because it can indicate two opposite conditions: if it is Pale it
indicates severe internal Cold and Yang deficiency; while if it is Red and without
coating it indicates severe Yin deficiency. In the first instance, the patient cannot
extend the tongue enough because internal Cold contracts the muscles, while in
the la er instance this happens because there are not enough fluids in the
tongue.

     CRACKED
   Generally, cracks on the surface of the tongue indicate Yin deficiency or the
tendency to it but, though this is the most common cause, there are others such
as Dampness or deficiency of the Original Qi. Horizontal cracks (Fig. 25.5 )
indicate Yin deficiency, usually of the Stomach or Kidneys, or both, and they are
more commonly seen in the elderly.

      FIG. 25.5   Horizontal cracks
   Irregular cracks (Fig. 25.6 ) usually indicate Stomach-Yin deficiency or the
tendency to it. (See Plate 25.4 on p. P24 .)

      FIG. 25.6   Irregular cracks
   A central short crack in the midline of the tongue (Fig. 25.7 ) is very common
and it indicates Stomach-Yin deficiency, or the tendency to it. (See Plate 25.5 on
p. P24 .)

      FIG. 25.7   Stomach crack
   A central long crack in the midline of the tongue (Fig. 25.8 ) is also common
and its clinical significance depends on its depth and on the colour of the tongue
body, especially the tip. (See Plates 25.6 and 25.7 on p. P24 .)
      FIG. 25.8   Heart crack
   If the Heart crack is shallow and the body colour normal, this simply
indicates a constitutional tendency to Heart pa erns and it does not have a
specific clinical significance. However, if a person has such a crack, any
emotional stress from which he or she might suﬀer will have deeper
repercussions than for someone without a Heart crack. According to Dr J. H. F.
Shen, a shallow Heart crack on a normal body colour may also indicate heart
disease in the parents or even grandparents.
   If the Heart crack is deep, it indicates that the person may suﬀer from a Heart
pa ern due to emotional stress, all the more so if the tip is also Red. One could
describe diﬀerent situations of emotional stress in order of increasing severity as
manifested on the tongue as follows:

          • shallow Heart crack, normal body colour
          • no Heart crack, Red tip
          • deep Heart crack, normal body colour
          • shallow Heart crack, Red tip
          • deep Heart crack, Red tip
          • deep Heart crack, Red tip with red points
          • deep Heart crack, Red tongue with redder tip and red points
          • deep Heart crack, Red tongue with redder and swollen tip
      and red points.
   Short, transverse cracks on the sides (Fig. 25.9 ) are a clear sign of Spleen-Yin
deficiency. This is not common and is not a common condition often described
among the Spleen pa erns; such cracks are the easiest way of identifying such a
pa ern (see Plate 25.5 on p. P24 .)

      FIG. 25.9   Transverse Spleen cracks
   Short, transverse cracks behind the tip in the Lung area (Fig. 25.10 ) usually
indicate a past Lung pathology such as pneumonia, whooping cough or
repeatedlung infections during childhood. As such cracks reflect past
pathologies, they do not have a major clinical significance.
      FIG. 25.10   Lung cracks
   An extremely deep midline crack with other small cracks branching out from
it (Fig. 25.11 ) is usually seen in a Red tongue without coating. It indicates a
severe Kidney-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat in the Kidneys and Heart.

      FIG. 25.11   Deep midline cracks with small cracks

    DEVIATED
   The Deviated tongue deviates to one side when extended (Fig. 25.12 ).

      FIG. 25.12   Deviated tongue
   The most common clinical significance of a Deviated tongue is internal Wind
and this type of tongue is most commonly seen in the elderly. In a young person
it may be related to a Heart deficiency.

    MOVING
   The Moving tongue moves slowly from side to side with large-amplitude
movements when it is extended and the patient cannot control its movement. It
always indicates internal Wind and is usually seen in the elderly.

    QUIVERING
   The Quivering tongue trembles rapidly and with small-amplitude movements
as it is extended. The most common clinical significance of a Quivering tongue in
chronic conditions is Spleen-Qi or Spleen-Yang deficiency.

    TOOTHMARKED
   The tongue with teethmarks (Fig. 25.13 ) indicates chronic Spleen-Qi
deficiency, but since a tongue with a normal body shape can have teethmarks, do
not assume that the presence of teethmarks necess-arily means it is Swollen. (See
Plate 25.8 on p. P24 .)

    TONGUE COATING IN EXTERNAL DISEASES

    PHYSIOLOGY OF TONGUE COATING
   The Stomach rots and ripens food, and during the process of digestion a
small amount of what the ancient Chinese books called "turbidity" or "turbid
fluids" escapes upwards to reach the tongue: this forms a coating. Therefore the
presence of a coating indicates the normal functioning of Stomach-Qi. A normal
coating should be white and thin enough to see the body colour through it.
Although the tongue coating reflects primarily the physiological activity of the
Stomach, the Spleen and the Kidneys also play a role in its formation; for this
reason, if a tongue lacks a coating this may indicate Stomach-Yin or Kidney-Yin
deficiency, or both.
   It should be noted that the tongue coating is naturally thicker at the root of
the tongue and thinnest towards the tip, and that the coating does not extend to
the very edges of the tongue.

  CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF TONGUE
COATING
   The tongue coating reflects primarily the state of the Yang organs and
especially of the Stomach. It also reflects conditions of Deficiency or Excess and
of Heat or Cold (Box 26.1 ).

          BOX 26.1        CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF
      TONGUE COATING
         • Yang organs
         • Deficiency-Excess
         • Heat-Cold
   Observation of the tongue coating needs to be based on a careful analysis of
the history of the patient because the tongue coating changes very rapidly in
acute conditions and can reflect short-term variations. For example, a yellow
tongue coating in the centre indicates Stomach-Heat and this could equally be a
chronic condition of Stomach-Heat or simply an acute stomach upset. We
therefore need to enquire carefully to exclude the possibility that the yellow
coating merely reflects an acute but passing condition. Apart from the history,
the brightness of the coating can give us an indication of its duration: the duller
the coating, the more chronic is the condition.
   As the coating reflects primarily the condition of the Yang organs, its
thickness and particularly its distribution give a clear indication of a pathology
aﬀecting one of the Yang organs. For example, the sides of the tongue reflect the
condition of the Liver and Gall-Bladder and we can diﬀerentiate between these
two by referring to the body colour or coating, that is, if the body colour is
aﬀected it indicates a Liver pathology, whereas if the coating is aﬀected it
indicates a Gall-Bladder pathology. Similarly for the root of the tongue: if the
root of the tongue is Red without coating this indicates Kidney-Yin deficiency
with Empty-Heat, whereas if it has a thick coating it indicates a pathology of one
of the Yang organs of the Lower Burner (Bladder or Intestines).
   The tongue coating also gives us a good indication of Deficiency and Excess
conditions because a thick coating with root always reflects a Full condition
while a coating without root or the complete absence of coating always reflects a
Deficiency condition. This will be described in more detail below.
   The tongue coating gives also a very clear indication of the Hot or Cold
nature of a condition but, as indicated above, it may merely reflect a passing,
acute condition.
   Box 26.1 summarizes the significance of a tongue coating.

    PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF COATING
   The presence or absence of coating tells us primarily about the state of the
Stomach-Qi. If the tongue has a coating with root, it indicates that the Stomach-
Qi is still intact even if the excessive thickness or colour of the coating is
pathological. Excluding the case of a normal, thin white coating, the tongue with
coating usually indicates a Full condition precisely because the Stomach-Qi is
intact. A tongue without coating indicates that the Stomach-Qi is severely
weakened and therefore a Deficiency condition. Therefore, it is be er to have a
thick, pathological coating with root than not to have a coating.
   How does the coating disappear from the tongue surface? In chronic
conditions, the tongue coating disappears gradually over a long time (usually
years); in acute conditions, and especially acute, febrile diseases in children, the
coating may disappear very quickly in a ma er of days.
   In chronic conditions characterized by the absence of coating, with treatment
the coating should return gradually and quite slowly; this is a positive sign. If
the coating appears suddenly on a tongue that previously lacked it, this is a bad
sign; for example, in a patient with cancer the sudden return of coating to a
particular area of the tongue may indicate a metastasis of the corresponding
organ.
   Conversely, if a tongue has a very thick, pathological coating, its sudden total
or partial disappearance in the course of a disease is a poor prognostic sign
because it indicates the sudden depletion of Stomach-Qi. However, the clinical
significance is diﬀerent if a thick tongue coating becomes normal as a result of
treatment; as indicated above, the tongue coating can change much more quickly
than the tongue-body colour.

     COATING WITH OR WITHOUT ROOT
   We can compare the tongue coating to grass: it should "grow" out of the
tongue body just as grass grows out of the soil and it should have "roots" just as
grass stems have roots in the earth. A coating with root reflects the normal
functioning of Stomach-Qi even if the coating may be pathological (e.g. too thick
and dark yellow). A coating without root resembles mown grass sca ered on
barren ground: it looks as if it has been "added" on top of the tongue rather than
growing out of it. (See Plates 26.1a and b on p. P25 .) In severe conditions, the
rootless coating may look like salt or snow sprinkled on top of the tongue. A
rootless coating indicates the beginning of the weakening of Stomach-Qi in the
course of a chronic disease. Therefore, it is be er to have a thick, pathological
coating with root than to have a thin coating without root.
   It should be emphasized that the coating with root is not necessarily thin,
although that is the most common situation. The coating without root can also be
thick and often sticky: this represents the worst scenario because it indicates that,
on the one hand, Stomach-Qi is weakened and, on the other, that there is a
significant pathogenic factor (against which the body is unable to fight due to the
Stomach-Qi deficiency) (Fig. 26.1 ). For this reason it is obviously be er to have a
thin rather than a thick coating without root. (See Plate 26.1c on p. P25 .)

        FIG. 26.1   Clinical significance of coating with or without root according to thickness
   Box 26.2 summarizes the four diﬀerent situations seen in coating with and
without root.

             BOX 26.2              COATING WITH OR WITHOUT
        ROOT
            • Thin coating with root: healthy Stomach-Qi
            • Thick coating with root: strong pathogenic factor, Stomach-
        Qi still intact
            • Thin coating without root: beginning of weakening of
        Stomach-Qi
            • Thick coating without root: strong pathogenic factor,
        Stomach-Qi weakened

     COATING THICKNESS
   The normal coating is thin and it should be possible to see the tongue body
through it. If the tongue body cannot be seen, the tongue coating is too thick. The
thickness of the tongue coating reflects the strength of the pathogenic factor
clearly and accurately: the thicker the coating the stronger the pathogenic factor.
If a thin coating becomes thick, this indicates that the pathogenic factors are
ge ing stronger or that they are penetrating deeper into the Interior. The la er
situation applies to conditions of acute, external diseases, which will be
explained in greater detail below. Therefore, if we are treating a patient with a
thick tongue coating, we should expect it to become gradually thinner. In some
cases, a thick tongue coating can revert back to normal even after a very short
time.
   As mentioned above, a thick coating may be with or without root but the
clinical significance of its thickness is the same - that is, it reflects the strength of
a pathogenic factor.

     COATING DISTRIBUTION
   Generally speaking, the same areas that reflect changes in the tongue-body
colour also reflect changes in the tongue coating, but there are some diﬀerences.
For example, the tongue coating never extends to the very tip or the very edges
of the tongue.
   The most common locations where a thick coating is observed are in the
centre and on the root of the tongue. A thick coating in the centre reflects the
presence of a pathogenic factor in the Stomach, which may be Cold, Heat,
Dampness or Phlegm depending on the colour and consistency of the coating,
whereas a thick coating on the root reflects the presence of a pathogenic factor in
the Bladder or Intestines.
   A pathogenic factor in the Gall-Bladder (Fig. 26.2 ) may be manifested in a
variety of ways; the most common one is a bilateral or unilateral coating that
comes forward in one or two strips on the edges. (See Plate 26.2 on p. P25 .)

      FIG. 26.2   Coating in the Gall-Bladder area

     COATING MOISTURE
   The normal coating should be relatively moist, indicating a good supply and
movement of Body Fluids. If the coating is too dry, it indicates either Heat or Yin
deficiency. If the coating is too wet, it indicates severe Yang deficiency.

     COATING TEXTURE
   The normal coating texture should be like the hairs of a very fine brush, in
Western medicine corresponding to the filiform papillae. The individual "hairs"
(filiform papillae) should be clearly seen and they should not be too dry or too
wet. Pathological textures of the coating make it sticky, slippery or mouldy.

     Sticky Coating
   The sticky (also called greasy) coating has an oily but coarse appearance and
the individual papillae can still be seen. (See Plate 26.3 on p. P25 .) To visualize a
sticky coating, one can use the analogy of a toothbrush of very fine, natural hair
spread with bu er or lard: the toothbrush will appear very greasy but the
individual hairs can still be seen. Thus, although the sticky coating is greasy and
oily, it may also be, in addition, dry. This may seem a contradiction but it is not.
To use the same analogy, we can think of a toothbrush with very fine hairs
which has been spread with bu er and left for several days; after that time, it
will still have a greasy appearance but it will be dry. Thus, we should not
identify "stickiness" of the tongue coating with wetness.
   The sticky coating indicates either Dampness or Phlegm and especially the
la er. The sticky coating is extremely common: in my practice out of a database
of 2378 patients nearly 30% have such a coating.
     Slippery Coating
   The slippery coating has a greasy look. It is characterized by the fact that the
individual papillae cannot be easily distinguished as they seem to be covered by
an oily fluid. To compare the slippery with the sticky coating, the former is oilier
and the individual papillae cannot be distinguished, whereas the la er is coarser
and the individual papillae can be distinguished. The slippery coating, like the
sticky coating, also indicates Dampness or Phlegm but predominantly
Dampness.

     Mouldy Coating
   The mouldy coating looks thick, patchy and crumbly. Chinese books describe
it as "tofu"; to use a Western analogy, it could be described as "co age cheese".
The mouldy coating also looks greasy and is by definition without root.
   The mouldy coating indicates also Dampness or Phlegm but against a
background of Stomach-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat. Empty-Heat plays a
role in the formation of the Phlegm indicated by the mouldy coating in
evaporating the fluids. The mouldy coating is seen only in the elderly.
   Box 26.3 summarizes the pa erns underlying diﬀerent coating textures.

          BOX 26.3         COATING TEXTURE
          • Sticky coating: Dampness or Phlegm (especially la er)
          • Slippery coating: Dampness or Phlegm (especially the
      former)
          • Mouldy coating: Dampness or Phlegm with Stomach-Yin
      deficiency

     TONGUE COATING IN EXTERNAL
DISEASES
   In external diseases from invasion of Wind, the interpretation of the tongue
coating is quite diﬀerent from that of internal diseases.
   In external diseases the thickness of the coating reflects, not only the intensity
of the pathogenic factor, but also its progression towards the Interior: thus, if in
the course of an acute external disease, the coating becomes thicker it indicates
that not only has the pathogenic factor become stronger but that it is beginning
to penetrate into the Interior.
   The coating in external diseases reflects Hot and Cold influences in the same
way as in internal diseases, but there are diﬀerences. The most important
diﬀerence is that the coating tends to be white in the very beginning stages of an
invasion of Wind even if it is Wind-Heat. If during an acute external disease the
coating turns from white to yellow, this means there is not only a change from
Cold to Heat (although a white coating may appear also in Wind-Heat), but also
a penetration of the pathogenic factor into the Interior.
    The distribution of the coating also reflects the stages of penetration of an
external pathogenic fac-tor. In the very beginning stages of an invasion of
external Wind, the coating may be more concentrated on the front third or on the
sides. In this context, these two areas correspond to the Exterior of the body
while the centre of the tongue corresponds to the Interior. (See Fig. 24.8 on p. 212
)
    Thus, if after a few days the coating from these two areas extends towards the
centre of the tongue, it indicates that a pathogenic factor is penetrating into the
Interior.

    QI-DEFICIENCY TONGUES
   The tongue-body colour reflects primarily the condition of Blood rather than
Qi and therefore a mild deficiency of Qi may not manifest on the tongue at all. In
long-standing cases of Qi deficiency the tongue may become slightly Pale.
   Severe Spleen-Qi deficiency may manifest with a swelling on the sides of the
tongue in the central section (Fig. 27.1 ). (See also Plate 27.1 on p. P25 .) This
swelling diﬀers from a Liver swelling in that it is much wider and it is more in
the central section of the tongue (Middle Burner).

      FIG. 27.1   Swelling on the sides from Spleen-Qi deficiency
   Stomach-Qi deficiency manifests with a rootless coating or with lack of
coating in the centre (with the tongue-body colour still normal).

    YANG-DEFICIENCY TONGUES
   In Yang deficiency the tongue is definitely Pale and it tends also to be slightly
wet. In severe Yang deficiency, the tongue may also become Swollen but the
swelling itself is due to the presence of Dampness or Phlegm rather than the
Yang deficiency itself.

          A Swollen tongue does not indicate Yang deficiency but rather
      Dampness or Phlegm.
   When the tongue is Pale, one cannot generally identify which is the main
organ involved. For example, the tongue's Paleness may be due to Spleen-Yang
deficiency, Kidney-Yang deficiency, or both, and we cannot deduce from the
tongue alone which is the case. The only guideline one can follow is that the
more Pale and Swollen the tongue is, the more likely it is that the cause is
Kidney-Yang deficiency.

     BLOOD-DEFICIENCY TONGUES
   In Blood deficiency the tongue is also Pale but tending to be slightly dry. In
severe cases of Blood deficiency, the tongue should be Thin as well as Pale but,
for the reasons explained above, this is seldom the case.
   Liver-Blood deficiency is frequently indicated by a Pale colour on the sides in
the Liver area. Although the tip corresponds to the Heart, the tip is never Pale on
its own in Heart-Blood deficiency; in this condition, however, the tongue may
become Pale in the chest area (see Fig. 23.8 p. 205 ).

     YIN-DEFICIENCY TONGUES
   The tongue coating is formed during the process of the Stomach's digestion
of food and, as we have seen above, the normal tongue should have a thin, white
coating, which indicates a good state of Stomach-Qi. The normal coating is
formed by the "turbid fluids" produced by the Stomach's process of digestion
and is therefore an expression of the normal state of Stomach fluids and
therefore Qi and Yin.
   If Stomach-Qi is weakened, the very first sign of this on the tongue will be a
rootless coating in the centre; if Stomach-Qi gets weaker the coating will be
rootless all over the tongue and if Stomach-Qi deficiency progresses to Stomach-
Yin deficiency the tongue will lack a coating entirely. As the Stomach is the
origin of fluids, a tongue without coating always indicates a deficiency of
Stomach-Yin. Of course, a tongue without coating is also seen in deficiency of
Yin of other organs but, whichever other organ is involved, it always indicates
Stomach-Yin deficiency. For example, the tongue may lack a coating in the front
indicating Lung-Yin deficiency but, because the coating is a reflection of
Stomach-Qi and Stomach-Yin, we can say that in this case there is a deficiency of
Yin of both the Lungs and Stomach. In terms of treatment this means that,
whenever we see a tongue without coating, Stomach-Yin should always be
nourished whatever other organ is involved.
   It is most important to stress that Yin deficiency on the tongue is manifested
by the lack of coating and not by the redness of the tongue body. Thus, if a
tongue has a normal body colour and lacks coating we can say that it indicates
Yin deficiency, whereas if it is Red and lacks a coating it indicates Yin deficiency
with Empty-Heat. Therefore, the lack of coating by itself indicates Yin deficiency,
whereas the lack of coating associated with the redness of the tongue body
indicates Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat. In other words, although Empty-Heat
arises from Yin deficiency, eventually, especially in the beginning stages, Yin
deficiency may and does occur frequently without Empty-Heat, in which case
the tongue lacks a coating but is not Red.

         Remember : Yin deficiency is manifested by the lack of
      coating, not by the redness of the tongue, i.e.:
         • lack of coating: Yin deficiency
         • lack of coating and redness: Yin deficiency and Empty-Heat.
   We can look upon Stomach-Yin deficiency as the beginning of a Yin
deficiency that will eventually aﬀect other organs. However, this does not mean
that a Yin deficiency is always indicated by Stomach-Yin deficiency. For
example, it is quite possible for someone to suﬀer from Lung-Yin deficiency
without Stomach-Yin deficiency manifesting on the tongue coating. However, if
the Yin deficiency manifests with a lack of coating, we can say that there is some
underlying Stomach-Yin deficiency.
   We can identify several stages of Yin deficiency according to the tongue
coating and the body colour. As far as the Stomach is concerned, Stomach-Qi
deficiency usually precedes Stomach-Yin deficiency and the very first and
lightest sign of Stomach-Qi deficiency would be a rootless coating in the centre.
At the other end of the scale, the most severe type of Yin deficiency (by this time
with Empty-Heat) would be a tongue that is Red, completely without coating
and possibly with cracks indicating both Stomach-Yin and Kidney-Yin
deficiency. We can therefore say that the tongue coating or the absence of it
reflects a progression from Qi deficiency to Yin deficiency usually starting with
the Stomach and gradually aﬀecting other organs.
   The most common stages of this process that we can identify are as follows:

         • Normal tongue with thin-white coating with root : indicates
      good Stomach-Qi.
         • Rootless coating in the centre, normal body colour :
      indicates the beginning of Stomach-Qi deficiency (Fig. 27.2 ).
      FIG. 27.2   Tongue with rootless coating in the centre
   • Rootless coating all over, normal body colour : indicates
Stomach-Qi deficiency (Fig. 27.3 and Plates 26.1.a b on p. P25 ).

      FIG. 27.3   Tongue with rootless coating all over
   • Rootless coating all over but missing in the centre, normal
body colour : indicates the beginning of Stomach-Yin deficiency
(Fig. 27.4 ). A variation of this tongue would be that the centre is
Red, which indicates Stomach-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat
(not aﬀecting other organs) (Fig. 27.5 ).

     FIG. 27.5 Tongue with rootless coating all over, missing in the centre and
   Red in the centre
   • Coating missing all over, normal body colour : indicates
advanced Stomach-Yin deficiency. A variation of this tongue
would be that the centre is Red, which indicates advanced
Stomach-Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat (not aﬀecting other
organs).
   • Coating missing all over, Red body colour : indicates
advanced Yin deficiency with Empty-Heat of the Stomach and
other organs, notably the Kidneys. A variation of this tongue
would be that, in addition to the above signs, the tongue also has a
deep, midline Stomach crack and other sca ered cracks, which
      simply indicate a more severe condition of Yin deficiency of the
      Stomach and Kidneys (Fig. 27.6 ).
                                          Red • no coating

            FIG. 27.6 Tongue with no coating, Red body colour, deep, midline Stomach
         crack and other scattered Stomach cracks

   Any of the first five tongues indicated above could also have a central
Stomach crack or sca ered Stomach cracks (Figs 27.2 -27.5 ), which would
simply indicate a pre-existing tendency to Stomach-Yin deficiency.

         BOX 27.1           DEFICIENCY PATTERNS
         Qi deficiency
         • General Qi deficiency: slightly Pale
         • Spleen-Qi deficiency: teethmarks or swollen on sides in
      central section
         • Stomach-Qi deficiency: rootless coating
         • Yang deficiency: Pale and slightly wet
         Blood deficiency
         • General Blood deficiency: Pale and slightly dry
         • Liver-Blood deficiency: Pale on the sides
         Yin deficiency
         • General Yin deficiency: lack of coating
         • Stomach-Yin deficiency: lack of coating in the centre
         • Lung-Yin deficiency: lack of coating in the front third
         • Kidney-Yin deficiency: lack of coating all over, Red body

  THE TONGUE IN PHLEGM AND
DAMPNESS
   Both Phlegm and Dampness may manifest with a Swollen tongue and a
sticky coating. However, in the case of Phlegm the swelling of the tongue is
predominant, whereas in the case of Dampness the coating is predominant.
Although both Phlegm and Dampness may derive from Qi deficiency, Qi
deficiency on its own does not cause the tongue to be Swollen; therefore a
Swollen tongue indicates not Qi deficiency but rather the presence of a
pathogenic factor, that is, Phlegm or Dampness.
   The tongue coating will diﬀer slightly depending on whether there is
Dampness or Phlegm present. Dampness causes the coating to appear more
slippery and smooth, whereas a coating indicating Phlegm tends to be slightly
rough and sticky.

     THE TONGUE IN HEAT
   Heat always manifests with a Red body colour and when examining a Red
tongue the first question I ask myself is whether the tongue has a coating or not:
a Red tongue with a coating with root (whatever its colour) indicates Full-Heat
whereas a Red tongue without coating (or with a rootless coating) indicates
Empty-Heat.

          • Full-Heat : Red tongue with coating
          • Empty-Heat : Red tongue without coating
   When observing a Red tongue indicating Heat, we should identify the level
of the Heat in accordance with the identification of pa erns according to the
Four Levels. Although the theory of the Four Levels was developed to explain
the symptoms and signs of acute febrile diseases, it can be applied to conditions
of chronic Heat. Indeed, much of the knowledge regarding Red tongues and red
points derives from the theory of the Four Levels.
   At the Defensive-Qi level, the tongue may be Red or slightly Red on the front
or sides, or both, in the areas corresponding to the Exterior in the context of
invasions of external Wind. (See Fig. 23.4 on p. 205 .)
   At the Qi level, the tongue is Red with a yellow, dark yellow, brown or even
black coating. However, within the Qi level one can distinguish the two
conditions of Heat or Fire. Heat is more superficial than Fire and can be cleared
with pungent-cold herbs. Fire is deeper than Heat and needs to be drained with
bi er-cold herbs. Within the theory of the Six Stages, the Bright-Yang channel
pa ern corresponds to Heat (of the Stomach) and the Bright-Yang organ pa ern
corresponds to Fire. Within the theory of the Four Levels the pa ern of Stomach-
Heat corresponds to Heat, whereas that of Dry Heat in the Stomach and
Intestines corresponds to Fire. The tongue corresponding to Heat is Red with a
yellow coating, whereas that corresponding to Fire is darker Red and with a dry,
dark-yellow, brown or even black coating.
   At the Nutritive-Qi and Blood levels, the tongue is Red and dry without a
coating because at these levels the Fire has injured Yin.
   Box 27.2 summarizes the tongue signs according to the Four Levels.

          BOX 27.2        THE FOUR LEVELS AND THE
      TONGUE
          • Slightly Red on the sides/front: Defensive-Qi level
          • Red with dark-yellow coating: Qi level
          • Red without coating: Nutritive-Qi level
          • Dark Red without coating, dry: Blood level

     THE TONGUE IN COLD
   Cold aﬀecting a Yin organ will manifest primarily on the tongue-body colour,
which becomes Pale. For example, Spleen-Yang deficiency commonly manifests
with a Pale tongue. Cold aﬀecting a Yang organ will manifest primarily on the
tongue coating. For example, Cold in the Stomach manifests with a white coating
in the centre.
   When assessing the tongue in Cold pa erns, we must distinguish Full- from
Empty-Cold. Full-Cold manifests primarily on the coating, which becomes thick
and white, while Empty-Cold manifests primarily on the colour and moisture of
the tongue body, which becomes Pale and slightly wet.

     THE TONGUE IN QI AND BLOOD
STAGNATION
   The tongue-body colour reflects the condition of Blood more than that of Qi.
Therefore, in conditions of Qi stagnation the tongue-body colour may be
unchanged, whereas in Blood stasis the tongue-body colour will become Purple.
Chinese books frequently state that Liver-Qi stagnation manifests with a Purple
tongue but I disagree with this as, in my opinion, a Purple colour on the sides
always indicates Blood stasis.
   In severe and long-standing conditions of Liver-Qi stagnation, the sides in the
Liver area may become Red. However, in this case too, we can say that the
tongue-body colour may reflect the condition of Blood primarily because the
redness of the sides of the tongue indicates that long-standing Qi stagnation has
given rise to Heat. Thus, the redness on the sides reflects the Heat rather than the
Qi stagnation.
   Blood stasis may manifest also with a Purple and dark colour of the
sublingual veins. As mentioned above, this normally reflects the early stages of
Blood stasis, particularly when it occurs in the Middle and Upper Burners.

     THE TONGUE IN INTERNAL WIND
   In internal Wind, the tongue may be Stiﬀ, Moving or Deviated. Stiﬀ is
probably the most common way in which internal Wind manifests; the Moving
tongue is not frequently seen, while the Deviated tongue indicating internal
Wind is usually seen only in patients suﬀering from Wind-stroke.
     THE TONGUE IN EXTERNAL INVASIONS
OF WIND
   As far as the body colour is concerned, in external invasions of Wind-Cold
the tongue-body colour does not change. In invasions of Wind-Heat the tongue-
body colour may become Red in the front or sides, or both, and, especially in
children, it may also have red points in these areas. As far as the coating is
concerned, this reflects invasions of external Wind only when the pathogenic
factor is particularly strong, in which case the coating becomes thick. In the very
beginning stages of invasion of Wind, the coating is white even with Wind-Heat;
in other words, in the context of external invasions of Wind, a white colour of the
coating indicates the early stage of invasion whereas a yellow colour indicates a
later stage.
