the bulk of laser research was done in chatgpt or gemini, I think it was a deep research with gemini.


The VSS pin on an op-amp is the negative power supply voltage or ground reference for the circuit, providing a common reference point for all other voltages in the system. It is essential for establishing a stable voltage reference and allowing current to flow through the op-amp's components.

The VDD pin on an op-amp is the positive power supply pin that provides the necessary voltage for the op-amp to operate. It is essential for powering the internal circuitry of the op-amp and enabling it to amplify signals.

# Materials
## Laser Diodes

^ filter by wavelength, and case, you want a can shape, not sure metal can or what. I think the 3 lead is necessary

## Mosfet
used as the voltage gate so the LED doesn't explode

## Op Amp
Used to monitor LED for how much voltage or current or electricity it needs.
