## Case study -week 8

**喘與哮有何區別****?**

- 在金元以前的醫學文獻中喘與哮二症無嚴格區別，常混為一談。 但二者在病因、病機及臨床表現上均有不同，故應予區分。 哮有宿根，表現為發作性的痰鳴氣喘，以呼吸急促，喉間哮鳴為特徵；而喘則多并發於多種急慢性病證之中，雖呼吸急促，而喉間並無哮鳴聲。 《醫學正傳．哮喘》謂："大抵哮以聲響名，喘以氣息言。 夫喘促喉中如水雞聲者，謂之哮；氣促而連屬不能以息者，謂之喘。 "可見哮必兼喘，而喘未必兼哮。 【常見證候】 風寒閉肺氣喘：臨床表現有喘急胸悶，伴有咳嗽，咯痰清稀色白，初起多兼見惡寒發熱，無汗，頭身疼痛，口不渴，舌苔薄白，脈象浮緊。 風熱犯肺氣喘：表現為喘急煩悶，伴有咳嗽，咯痰黃稠；或見發熟，汗出惡風，口渴，胸痛。 舌苔薄白或薄黃，脈象浮數。

What is the difference between Breathlessness (Chun-喘) and wheezing (Xia-哮)?

In medical literature before the Jin and Yuan Dynasties, there was no strict distinction between Breathlessness and wheezing, and they were often confused. However, the two are different in etiology, pathogenesis and clinical manifestations, so they should be distinguished. Wheezing has a perennial root, manifesting as episodic wheezing with phlegm and wheezing, characterized by shortness of breath and wheezing in the throat; breathlessness is often complicated by a variety of acute and chronic diseases. Although breathing is rapid, there is no wheezing in the throat. "The True Story of Medicine." "Asthma" says: "Mostly wheezing is named by the sound, and breathlessness (Chun) is named by the breath. Those who have shortness of breath and the sound of chickens (Wheezing) in the throat are called wheezing; those who are short of breath and unable to breathe are called breathlessness." It can be seen that wheezing must be accompanied by breathlessness, and breathlessness may not be accompanied by wheezing.

[Common syndromes] Wind-cold obstruction the lung cause asthma: clinical manifestations include shortness of breath, chest tightness, cough, thin and white phlegm, usually accompanied by aversion to cold and fever, no sweat, head and body pain, lack of thirst, and thin white tongue coating. , pulse is loose and tight. Breathlessness caused by wind-heat invading the lungs: characterized by shortness of breath and boredom, accompanied by coughing, and yellow and thick phlegm; or ripeness, sweating, bad wind, thirst, and chest pain. The tongue coating is thin white or yellow, and the pulse is floating, rapid.

Case study- Wheezing

CASE1. Susan, 70-year-old female; Susan was diagnosed with emphysema ten years ago. During your intake you notice that she has shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing with much watery sputum. Further she states that she has a tight feeling in the chest and that her legs feel weak with ankles that are swollen. Her tongue is greasy white coating, and her pulse is rolling and weak at rear position.

Case 2. Ray, 31-year-old male; Ray states that he has a terrible cold. He has chills, fever and headache. Now he complains of cough, wheezing, and congestion with profuse thick yellow phlegm and his chest feels tight and oppressive. His tongue is red with a yellow greasy coating, and his pulse is rolling and slightly superficial.

CASE 3: Tom, 9-year-old boy; Ted's mother tells you that she brought him to the emergency room yesterday when he came down with a fever, shivering though no wind is present, and some sneezing. He has a slight cough and his eyes are inflamed. He also developed a rash over his face. This morning she found that his rash had disappeared, but his temperature had risen to 102.5°F. Ted now also has a cough with labored breathing, irritability, wheezing and nasal flaring and he is very thirsty. His tongue is red with a yellow coating and his pulse is rapid, full and slightly superficial.

Case 4.A 42-year-old woman had been suffering from asthma for 10 years. It started after the birth of her second child. She experienced a feeling of oppression of the chest and sometimes coughed up some yellow phlegm. She also suffered from lower backache and often felt dizzy. Occasionally she experienced tinnitus and her urine was pale and frequent. She felt very tired. Her tongue was slightly pale but with a yellow coating and her pulse was deep and Weak, especially on both Kidney positions.

Case 5. A 33-year-old woman had been suffering from breathlessness/asthma for the previous two years. She found it difficult to breathe out and her attacks were elicited by emotional stress. She also easily felt thirsty and experienced a bitter taste in her mouth occasionally. She had frequent headaches on the temples of a throbbing nature, and she felt generally wound-up and frustrated. She also felt easily hot and occasionally had palpitations. Her pulse was Wiry, and her tongue was Red with redder sides and tip, with a shallow midline Heart-crack. The sides also had red points.

Case  6.  

Tom, 64-year-old male. He had a trip to Arizona last fall for two weeks, He began to have some dry cough since then. The cough was worse at night with some sore throat, even he heard some wheezing voice. He also c/p about short of breathing, dyspnea. He felt some deep-seat phlegm which is difficult to expectorate, then the color of sputum was yellow.  The tongue is red/ dryness, without coating, the pulse is thin, rapid and strong.

2. Clinical application of TCM in asthma

Asthma was recognized in ancient China, and a number of classical formulae have been established for use in TCM [[14]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib14)

[Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib14). It is estimated that up to 30% of adults and 60% of children in the US are using complementary and alternative medicine for asthma management [[15]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib15) [Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib15). As one of the primary therapies of complementary and alternative medicine, TCM has a long history of use in treating diseases [[16]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib16) [Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib16). TCM has synergistic effects with its multiple components and targets, and it can be flexibly formulated according to the patient's physical condition to achieve personalized drug use with little toxicity and side effects. The application and effectiveness of using TCM for asthma has prevailed and been proven by many clinical trials [[17]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib17) [Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib17), [[18]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib18) [Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib18). Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials found that ASHMI (an extract of _Ganoderma lucidum, Radix Sophorae flavescentis,_ and _Radix Glycyrrhiza uralensis_) significantly reduced symptom scores, increased lung function and reduced the use of β2-agonists in moderate-persistent asthma. Although the onset of ASHMI action was somewhat slower than that of prednisone, longer-term therapy may be better [[19]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib19) [Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib19). A phase I study further indicated that ASHMI appeared to be safe and well tolerated by subjects with asthma [[20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib20) [Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib20). Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that STA-1 (composed of _Radix Rehmanniae Preparata, Cortex Moutan Radicis, Radix Ophiopogonis, Tuber Pinellia, Fructus Corni, Poria, Radix Panacis Quinquefolii, Rhizoma Alismatis, Radix Dioscoreae,_ and _Radix Glycyrrhizae_) could effectively suppress clinical symptoms, improve pulmonary function, and inhibit the synthesis of total and specific IgE without liver dysfunction in mild-to-moderate asthma patients aged 5–20 years old for 6 months [[21]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib21) [Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib21). A parallel, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the effect of Ding Chuan Tang (DCT, an herbal decoction composed of _Ginkgo biloba, Ephedra sinica, Tussilago farfara, Morus alba, Pinellia ternata, Perilla frutescens, Prunus armeniaca, Scutellaria baricalensis,_ and _Glycyrrhiza uralensis_) on children with mild to moderate persistent asthma aged 8–15. That trial suggests that DCT could reduce the severity of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and improve symptoms and medication scores for 12 weeks [[22]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib22) [Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib22). A registered multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy and safety of TCM in the treatment of acute asthma and found that Pingchuan Yiqi granules _(Ephedra sinica_ Stapf_,_ red ginseng_, Rhizoma Dioscoreae Nipponicae, Semen armeniacae amarae, Magnolia officinalis,_ beef-steak plant leaf_, Radix bupleuri,_ dried tangerine, and liquorice) significantly improved lung function and clinical symptoms (shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, and cough) in acute mild-to-moderate asthma patients, reduced the dose of short-acting β-adrenoceptor-agonists, and decreased systemic inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-5, IL-8, IL-1β, and prostaglandin D-2 (PGD2) without affecting the antiviral immune responses [[23]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib23) [Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib23). As an adjunctive therapy to oral montelukast, many TCM prescriptions have revealed greater efficacy in relation to lung function and quality of life in chronic asthma patients [[24]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib24) [Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib24), [[25]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib25) [Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib25). Similar trials also found that conventional Western medicine in conjunction with TCM prescriptions can reduce acute asthmatic attacks [[26]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib26) [Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib26) or TCM syndrome scores [[16]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib16) [Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib16). Even nine months after the end of treatment, differences in TCM syndrome scores persisted, indicating a favourable long-term effect of TCM [[27]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib27)

[Links to an external site.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221001682#bib27).

TCMs are important resources as drugs against various diseases, including asthma. As a natural product, the effective component of TCM has a diversified structure, lower toxicity, wide sources, and great anti-inflammatory potential. In this review, we discuss the leading progress in understanding the active ingredients from Chinese medicine plants used in asthma treatment. Our aim is to provide new ideas for therapeutic strategies.
