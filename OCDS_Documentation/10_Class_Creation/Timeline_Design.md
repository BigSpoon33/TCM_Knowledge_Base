## 📋 Overview

A well-designed timeline balances content delivery, practice, and assessment while maintaining reasonable pacing.

---

## 🎯 Timeline Principles

### 1. Logical Progression

Build concepts sequentially:
```
Week 1: Fundamentals
Week 2: Build on Week 1
Week 3: Apply Weeks 1-2
Week 4: Integrate all concepts
```

---

### 2. Balanced Workload

**Recommended per week:**
- Study material: 45-60 minutes
- Flashcards: 20-30 minutes
- Quiz: 15-20 minutes
- Homework: 60-90 minutes
- **Total:** 2.5-3.5 hours

---

### 3. Strategic Spacing

- Space similar topics across weeks
- Allow time for concept integration
- Build in review weeks
- Plan for midterm/final assessments

---

## 📅 Example Timeline

```yaml
weeks:
  - week: 1
    title: "Introduction"
    workload: light  # First week
    
  - week: 2-4
    workload: moderate
    
  - week: 5
    title: "Midterm Review"
    workload: light  # Review week
    
  - week: 6-11
    workload: moderate
    
  - week: 12
    title: "Final Integration"
    workload: heavy  # Final project
```
