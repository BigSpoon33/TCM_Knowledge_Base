Edema  

---

Edema refers to swelling due to fluid accumulation in the interstitial tissues. This  
subcutaneous retention of fluid leads to puffiness of the head, face, eyelids, limbs,  
and abdomen and even whole body. In TCM, shuǐ zhǒng (水肿) is a disorder of  
Water metabolism, caused by dysfunction of the Lung, Spleen, or Kidney failing to  
regulate fluids.  

---

Edema Etiology Biomedicine:
?
● Common causes include heart failure, renal disease, hepatic cirrhosis, hypoproteinemia,
venous or lymphatic obstruction, or endocrine dysfunction.

Seen in all age groups
depending on the
underlying cause

including syndromes such as dysuria, hematuria, milky urine, and dribbling. In  
TCM, this is grouped under Lín Zhèng (淋证) and is typically associated with  
accumulated Damp-Heat in the Bladder, Kidney Qi deficiency, or Liver Qi  
stagnation impairing urination.

elderly or postpartum
women

● Chronic cases: Require long-term support and diagnosis of
underlying dysfunction
Cystitis
Dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, Cloudy,
foul-smelling urine; ~30% cases have hematuria. WBCs
and bacteria in unspun urine. Suprapubic or urethral
tenderness on palpation
<!--SR:!2025-11-11,3,250-->

---

Dysuria Notes:
?
● Consider STIs if vaginal discharge or genital lesions
are present.
● Fever >101°F, vomiting may indicate renal
involvement.
Urethritis
Appr. 30% of women with UTI symptoms show no bacterial
growth. Distinction between STIs (Chlamydia, Gonorrhoea,
HSV) vs. low-count E. coli. If Gradual onset, absence of
hematuria → likely chlamydia. If Abrupt onset, hematuria,
suprapubic pain, short duration → likely E. coli or staph
Notes:
● Sexual history is critical for identifying chlamydial or
gonococcal urethritis.
Acute Pyelonephritis
Rapid onset, high fever (103°F), chills, nausea, vomiting,
back pain. CVA tenderness, abdominal tenderness,
leukocytosis. Pyuria with WBC casts, hematuria posible.
Gram stain shows bacteria; symptoms may persist
despite antibiotics
Notes:
● Persistent hematuria after resolution requires
evaluation for stones or tumour.
<!--SR:!2025-11-11,3,250-->

Dysuria Signs and Symptoms
Dysuria Biomedical Clinical Presentation:

Leukocyte esterase + Nitrites → UTI
WBC casts → pyelonephritis
Proteinuria → renal involvement
Crystals or stones → calculi (stone)
Low/no bacteria + pyuria → urethritis or STI
