## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
"Shen Tong" means "body pain" and "Zhu Yu" means "drive out stasis." Classic formula for chronic pain conditions where blood stasis combines with wind-dampness to block the channels and collaterals. Addresses both the stagnation and the external pathogenic factors that contribute to chronic pain patterns.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and circulation-improving effects. Blood-moving herbs contain compounds that improve microcirculation and reduce inflammation. Wind-dampness expelling herbs provide anti-rheumatic and pain-relieving effects. Studies demonstrate benefits in arthritis, chronic pain, and circulation disorders.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for chronic pain conditions with clear blood stasis signs. Particularly effective for people with long-standing pain that worsens in damp weather. Often used for arthritis, fibromyalgia, and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Best results when combined with physical therapy and lifestyle modifications.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, Wu Ling Zhi should be wrapped in cloth
**Timing**: Between meals, can increase frequency during pain flares
**Duration**: 6-12 weeks for chronic conditions, often used cyclically
