44 Chapter 1 / Formulas that Release the Exterior

Indications

Early-stage measles, scarlet fever, or similar diseases that pres-
ent with unevenly distributed rashes, cough, wheezing, nasal
obstruction and runny nose, slight chills and a sustained high
fever, irritability, a stifling sensation in the chest, restlessness
or even confusion, swollen and painful throat, thirst with
dryness of the mouth, a thin yellow and dry tongue coating,
and a floating, rapid pulse.

This is heat collecting in the Stomach and Lungs due to
yang toxins (variously conceived of as fetal toxins, endemic
warm pathogen toxins, or the measles virus) that have al-
ready damaged the fluids, along with simultaneous obstruc-
tion of the exterior by wind-heat. Heat, together with con-
straint in the exterior, causes slight chills and high fever and
prevents the venting of yang toxins and heat to the outside.
This becomes visible as a rash that does not surface evenly.
Heat collecting in the Lungs obstructs the dissemination and
downward-directing of qi, leading to cough, wheezing, na-
sal obstruction and discharge, and a painful, swollen throat.
Heat collecting in the Stomach readily enters the blood and
disturbs the spirit, causing irritability, restlessness, confusion,
and a stifling sensation in the chest. This heat also damages
the fluids, as reflected in thirst along with dry mouth and
tongue. The pulse is floating because the protective gi in the
exterior is obstructed, and rapid because this obstruction is
due to heat that has accumulated in the interior.

Analysis of Formula

To facilitate the complete expression of rashes in early-stage
measles and similar disorders, it is important to release the
exterior while simultaneously facilitating the venting of tox-
ins to the outside. Tamaricis Cacumen (cheng lit), the for-
mula’s chief herb, is acrid in taste, balanced in temperature,
and ascending in action. It enters the yang brightness channel
and is used specifically for discharging and dispersing mea-
sle-like rashes. Its action is supported by two different deputy
herbs. Arctii Fructus (niti bang zi) is acrid, cool, and moist.
It opens up areas of constraint in the exterior and the Lung
collaterals, soothes the throat, resolves toxicity, vents rashes,
and stops itching. Lophatheri Herba (dan zhi ye) clears heat
from the Heart via the urine. It thereby eliminates irritabil-
ity but without damaging the fluids, and prevents heat tox-
ins from sinking into the Pericardium. The various assistant
herbs support the actions of these three herbs. Puerariae Ra-
dix (ge gen), Cicadae Periostracum (chan tui), Schizonepetae
Spica (jing jie sui), and Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bd he)
release the exterior, disperse fire from constraint, and facili-
tate the venting of toxins. Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mi),
Scrophulariae Radix (xudn shen), and Ophiopogonis Radix
(mai men dong) drain heat from the interior, generate fluids,
and thereby facilitate the venting of toxin from the nut
