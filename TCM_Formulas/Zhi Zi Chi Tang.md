Indications

Constipation or chronic red-and-white dysenteric disorders
(i.e., those with both pus and blood in the stool) associated
with abdominal pain, cold extremities, a white tongue coat-
ing, and a submerged, wiry pulse.

This is Spleen cold from yang deficiency with accumula-
tion impeding the Intestines. If the Spleen yang is insufficient
to fulfill its functions of transportation and transformation,
cold accumulates in the Intestines, impeding their down-
ward-directing of qi and the movement of stools. This leads
to abdominal pain and constipation. Alternatively, chronic
accumulation that is not transformed exhausts the Spleen qi
and yang. This results in dysentery with both pus and blood
as the Spleen’s retaining function is impaired. Insufficiency of
Spleen yang implies failure of yang qi to reach the extremities,
which manifests in hands and feet that are difficult to keep
warm. The white tongue coating indicates cold accumulation.
A submerged pulse reflects an interior disorder, while a wiry
pulse is associated with stagnation and pain.

Analysis of Formula

Treating insufficiency of Spleen yang accompanied by accu-
mulation of cold in the interior presents the physician with
a dilemma. Merely tonifying a deficiency does not eliminate
severe stagnation. Attacking the accumulation by draining
downward, on the other hand, risks further damaging the
body’s yang qi. Thus, it is necessary to combine the strategy
of warming and tonifying the Spleen yang with that of purg-
ing the accumulation. This formula accordingly has two chief
herbs, Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi) and Rhei
Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng). Aconiti Radix lateralis pre-
parata (zhi fu zi) is acrid and strongly warming. It invigorates
the Spleen yang in order to disperse the congealed cold. Rhei
Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) flushes the Stomach and In-
testines to eliminate accumulation. Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan
jiang) functions as deputy by focusing the action of the for-
mula on the Spleen yang. It is acrid and warming and enters
into the Spleen and Stomach channels. Together with Aconiti
Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi), it supports the Spleen
yang so as to eliminate the cold pathogen. As early as the
Divine Husbandman’s Classic of the Materia Medica, it was
indicated for the treatment of dysenteric disorders. Ginseng

Radix (ren shen) and Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo) are the as-
sistants. Together with Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi
fu zi) and Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jid
