Formulas that Warm and Transform Water and Dampness 751

Comparison
> Vs, TRUE WARRIOR DEcocTION (zhen wii tang)

Although both formulas warm the Spleen and Kidneys and
support the yang in circulating the fluids, each has a differ-
ent focus. True Warrior Decoction (zhen wu tang) focuses
on warming the Kidneys. It warms the yang, preserves the
yin, promotes urination, and relaxes spasms. It is thus a very
important formula for treating fluid retention due to yang
deficiency characterized by abdominal pain and shivering.
Bolster the Spleen Drink (shi pi yin), on the other hand, fo-
cuses on warming the Spleen. Its ability to support the yang
and dispel cold is slightly stronger than True Warrior Decoc-
tion (zhen wii tang). It promotes the movement of qi and
transforms stagnation, and is therefore an important formula
for treating yang deficiency edema characterized by chest and
abdominal fullness and distention.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders includ-
ing chronic nephritis, rheumatic valvular heart disease, con-
gestive heart failure, and cirrhosis or other chronic hepatic
disorders.
