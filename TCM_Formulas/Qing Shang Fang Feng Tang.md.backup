### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant effects. Huang Lian and Huang Qin contain berberine and flavonoids with anti-bacterial properties. Lian Qiao provides anti-viral compounds. Studies demonstrate benefits in acne, conjunctivitis, and upper respiratory infections. The combination helps reduce inflammation and prevent secondary infections.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for inflammatory conditions affecting head, face, and sense organs. Particularly effective for acne in teenagers and young adults with heat constitution. Often provides rapid improvement in acute infections of eyes, ears, and sinuses. Best results when combined with appropriate topical care and dietary modifications.

### Dosage & Administration

**Preparation**: Standard decoction, can be used for topical washes (cooled)
