rior. It is thus best for cough that remains after the overt signs
of an external pathogen have receded. Inula Powder (jin fei
cdo san), on the other hand, addresses cough with phlegm at
the onset of an attack from an exterior wind-cold pathogen.

Modifications

* When the contemporary practitioner Jiao Shu-De uses this
formula to treat wind-cold cough, he often adds Perillae
Fructus (zi si zi), Armeniacae Semen (xing ren), Asteris
Radix (zi wan), Eriobotryae Folium (pi pd ye), and Raphani
Semen (Idi fu zi).

If headache accompanies the invasion of wind-cold, add
Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chudn xieng) and Angelicae dahuri-
cae Radix (bdi zhi).

If nasal congestion is prominent, add Xanthii Fructus (cang
er zi), Angelicae dahuricae Radix (bdi zhi), and Magnoliae
Flos (xin yf).

exterior while increasing its capacity to dispel yin-fluids that have
accumulated in the Lung.
