woman in the immediate postnatal period is especially prone
due to blood loss when giving birth. To treat this pattern, An-
gelicae pubescentis Radix (dti hud) and Schizonepetae Herba
(jing jie) are added to the basic formula.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
encephalitis B, meningitis, tetanus, pediatric epilepsy, cluster
headache, and migraine.

Modifications

* For acute febrile diseases with heat generating internal stir-
ring of wind, add Mori Folium (sang ye), Chrysanthemi
Flos (ji hua), Gentianae Radix (Ieng dan cdo), Uncariae
Ramulus cum Uncis (gou teng), and Gastrodiae Rhizoma
(tian md), or combine with Antelope Horn and Uncaria
Decoction (ling jido gou teng tang).

¢ For paralysis as a sequelae of encephalitis, combine with
Major Arrest Wind Pearls (da ding feng zhii).

¢ For chronic childhood convulsions due to prolonged di-
arrhea and chronic Spleen deficiency, take with Aconite
Accessory Root Pill to Regulate the Middle (fu zi li zhong
wan).

* For muscle twitches and spasms due to tetanus, combine
with True Jade Powder (yi zhen san).

True Jade Powder
yi zhen san

In medieval China, ‘true jade’ refers to the immortals, the celes-
tial beings who reside in heaven with the Jade Emperor. The effi-
cacy attributed to this formula, which brings those on the edge
of death back to life, is so outstanding that it could have been
composed by the immortals, hence the name.

Method of Preparation The source text advises to grind equal
amounts of the ingredients into a powder and take in 6g doses
with hot wine. Today the ingredients are ground into a powder,
sifted and mixed evenly, and taken in 3g doses with hot wine.
May also be prepared as a decoction, or the powder may be
applied externally to the affected area.

Actions Dispels wind, transforms phlegm, relieves muscular
tetany, and alleviates pain

Indications

Stiffness and spasms of the jaw, closed mouth, lip spasms,
deviation of the eyes, rigidity of the entire body to the point
of opisthotonus, and a wiry, tight pulse.

This is a type of muscular tetany (78 jing), a disorder
marked by a stiff and tense neck and jaw, spasms of the ex-
tremities, and possibly opisthotonus. Here the muscular tet-
any is due to wind and toxin invading the body through a
wound or ulceration, a disorder known as ‘wind due to in-
cised wounds’ (4% & po shang feng).

Chen Shi-Gong, author of True Lineage of External Medi-
cine, explained the pathogenesis of this disorder: “When the
skin is broken, pathogenic wind and toxin may make a sur-
prise attack and enter the channels and collaterals, gradually
penetrating to the interior” For this reason, wind that results
from incised wounds is classified as a condition due to exter-
nal wind. Wind moves and changes rapidly. Once it reaches
the mouth, it advances through the channels and causes stiff-
ness and spasms of the jaw, closed mouth, lip spasms, devia-
tion of the eyes, and rigidity of the entire body to the point
of opisthotonus. The wiry, tight pulse reflects the obstruction
from wind.

Analysis of Formula

The appropriate strategy for treating wind that has entered
the body from outside is to expel it, while also treating the
spasms that are the main manifestations of the pattern. For
this purpose, the formula uses herbs that disperse wind and
unblock the channels and collaterals with those that ex-
tinguish internal wind. One of the chief ingredients, acrid,
sweet, and warm Typhonii Rhizoma (bdi fu zi), dries damp-
ness, transforms phlegm, dispels wind, and stops spasms,
especially those of muscular tetany. It also enters the Liver
and Stomach channels, and is thus very effective in dispel-
ling wind from the head and face. The other chief ingredient,
acrid, warm Arisaematis Rhizoma preparatum (zhi tian ndn
xing), eliminates wind-phlegm from the channels and collat-
erals, arrests muscle twitches, and stops spasms.

The deputies, Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qidng
hud), Angelicae dahuricae Radix (bdi zhi), and Saposhnikovi-
ae Radix (fang feng), disperse wind and dispel the pathogenic
influences. In concert with the chief ingredients, they dispel
wind from the channels and collaterals and vent the patho-
genic influences through the exterior. The assistant, sweet and
slightly warm Gastrodiae Rhizoma (tian md), enters the Liver
channel to extinguish Liver wind and relieve spasms. This is
important, as externally-contracted wind can easily stir up
internal wind. The envoy, hot wine, unblocks the channels
and collaterals.

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula usually contains the untreated forms of Ty-


636 Chapter 14 / Formulas that Expel Wind

phonii Rhizoma (bdi fu zi) and Arisaematis Rhizoma pre-
paratum (zhi tian ndn xing), both of which are very toxic.
Dosage should therefore be carefully monitored, and the for-
mula should not be taken long-term or during pregnancy.
The acrid, drying ingredients in this formula readily injure
the fluids and exhaust the qi, and should not be used for ad-
vanced-stage muscular tetany (a pattern of fluid injury and
qi collapse). Severe hemorrhaging due to trauma may lead to
blood deficiency, which prevents the blood from nourishing
the sinews, and then to spasms. In such cases, the formula
should be modified to focus on nourishing the blood and
relaxing the sinews, rather than on dispelling wind.

Commentary

Wind entering the channels will manifest along the course
of the affected channel. Wind in the yang brightness chan-
nel—which traverses the mouth and lips, enters the gums,
and winds around the corners of the mouth and the lips—
causes stiffness and spasms in the jaw and lips. Wind in the
leg terminal yin channel—which connects with the tissues
surrounding the eyes—causes deviation of the eyes. Wind in
the leg greater yang channel, which meets the Governing ves-
sel at GV-14 (da zhui) and divides to run along both sides of
the spine, as well as the Governing vessel, which traverses the
midline of the back, causes full-body rigidity, or opisthoto-
nus.

This formula is based on one by the same name from For-
mulas of Universal Benefit from My Practice, which consists
of Arisaematis Rhizoma preparatum (zhi tidn ndn xing) and
Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng). This formula strengthens
the actions of the latter by adding ingredients that disperse
wind to the exterior, while simultaneously extinguishing in-
ternal wind.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders such as
neurotoxic clostridial disease, including tetanus and botu-
lism, as well as posttraumatic pain.

In the source text, a mixture of 1.5g of ground Cinnabaris (zhi sha)
and 60ml of yellow wine are added to the strained decoction. Cinna-
baris (zhi sha) is no longer used due to its heavy metal content. Ex-
pect good results if administration of the formula induces sweating
on the palms, soles, and sternum; if sweating does not occur, continue
administering for up to three days. Eliminates wind-phlegm, relieves
spasms and twitches, and alleviates pain. For stiffness and spasms of
the jaw, muscle twitches, and rigidity of the entire body to the point
of opisthotonus. In contrast to the principal formula, which focuses
on dispelling wind, this formula focuses on relieving spasms.

Because this formula contains toxic Cinnabaris (zhi sha), it is
contraindicated during pregnancy and should not be taken in large
doses or long-term. Nor should it be decocted, as heating this sub-
stance increases the risk of mercury poisoning. This formula was
devised by Shi Chuan-En, a contemporary physician from Shanxi
province.

before applying topically. At present, 2-3 times the above dosages
are generally used.

Consumption of foods that are thought to stimulate the stir-
ring of wind (44 fa wit), such as alcohol, coffee, spicy foods,
and seafood, as well as smoking, may interfere with the actions
of the herbs and should be avoided while taking this formula.

Actions Disperses wind, eliminates dampness, clears heat, and
cools the blood

Indications

Weepy, itchy, red skin lesions over a large part of the body, a
yellow or white tongue coating, and a forceful, floating, and
rapid pulse.

This is wind rash (A feng zhen) or damp rash (RF
shi zhen). It is caused by wind-heat or wind-dampness that
invades the body and contends with preexisting damp-heat.
It then becomes trapped between the flesh, skin, interstices,
and pores, and settles in the blood vessels. Unable to drain
internally or vent externally, it transforms into wind toxin.
The presence of wind, the primary pathogenic influence, is
reflected in the itchiness and the floating pulse. Bleeding that
occurs after excoriation is called ‘seepage of blood pearls’ and
is an indication of heat in the blood. This type of seepage is
caused by damp-heat trapped between the flesh and the in-
terstices and pores. The combination of heat in the blood and
damp-heat gives rise to toxin. The tongue coating varies ac-
cording to the level of penetration of the heat: when the heat
is superficial, the tongue coating will remain white; a slightly
deeper level of penetration produces a yellow coating. The
forceful, rapid pulse indicates internal heat and toxin. Disor-
ders of this nature, where the pathogenic influence is trapped
between layers of the body, are often difficult to treat.

Analysis of Formula

A complex condition such as wind or damp rash requires a
complex treatment strategy. To dispel the pathogenic qi to the
exterior, the formula disperses wind, eliminates dampness,
and clears heat. Because the disease process is located in the
blood vessels, it includes herbs that nourish and invigorate
the blood and that moisten dryness; this is in accordance
with the adage, “To treat wind, first treat the blood; when
the blood moves, the wind will naturally be extinguished.“
Itching, a sign of wind, is relieved by dispersing the wind.
The chief herbs, Schizonepetae Herba (jing jie), Saposhniko-
viae Radix (fang feng), Arctii Fructus (nit bang zi), and Ci-
cadae Periostracum (chdn tui), unblock the interstices and
pores and disperse external wind. The first group of deputies
treats the seepage of fluids. Atractylodis Rhizoma (cang zhu)
dries dampness; Sophorae flavescentis Radix (ku shen) clears
damp-heat; and Akebiae Caulis (mi tong) drains damp-heat
through the urine. Sophorae flavescentis Radix (ku shen) also
kills parasites and resolves toxicity, and is an effective remedy

for itchiness from damp-heat. The second group of deputies,
Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi
mu), clears qi-aspect fire, which helps drain the heat from
the interior and prevents the condition from advancing to a
deeper level.

The assistant ingredients address the blood aspects of
this disorder. Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di hudng) cools the
blood; Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui) nourishes and in-
vigorates the blood; and Sesami Semen nigrum (hei zhi md)
nourishes the blood and moistens. All of these herbs assist
the blood as a means of extinguishing the wind. The envoy,
Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo), clears heat, resolves toxicity,
and harmonizes the actions of the other herbs.

Cautions and Contraindications

Because this formula is primarily dispersing in nature, it
should not be used in cases with marked qi or blood defi-
ciency.

Commentary

This is one of three formulas by the same name (the oth-
er two are noted in ASSOCIATED FORMULAS below). Its
source has been attributed to the Golden Mirror of the Medi-
cal Tradition. It is one of the most important base formulas
for skin disorders in contemporary Chinese medicine. Its
original indications read:

[This formula] is effective for pernicious wind-dampness in-
vading the blood, causing sores and burrows (## # chudng jie)
that itch mercilessly, as well as wind-heat dormant papules (&
¥ yin zhen) in adults and children that are spread all over the
body in patchy, small macules, which come and go.

These indications make it clear that wind-dampness and
wind-heat at the blood level are the basic pathodynamics for
which this formula should be used, but that parasites, too,
can be a cause, Note that #+# ji@ chudng in contemporary
Chinese refers to scabies, and Sophorae flavescentis Radix (ki
shen) is an important herb for killing parasites in the skin.
Better results can often be achieved if treatment also involves
the topical application of the herbs.

Blood Aspect of the Formula

Herbs that treat the blood are essential to this formula, for
several reasons. First, the location of the disorder itself is
within the blood vessels and at the blood level. Second, the
adage, “To treat wind, first treat the blood; when the blood
moves, the wind will naturally be extinguished,’ implies that
blood stasis—rather than blood deficiency—is an important
secondary cause. This is due to wind and heat damaging the
blood yin, while dampness obstructs its movement. The use
of herbs that expel wind and dry dampness may further ag-
gravate these problems. For this reason, the blood-aspect
