## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
Classic formula for shaoyang disorder combined with spirit disturbance. The pattern involves heat and cold, interior and exterior conflicts leading to emotional instability. Chai Hu harmonizes while Long Gu and Mu Li anchor the spirit. Essential for conditions where physical and emotional symptoms are intertwined.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows anxiolytic, mood-stabilizing, and neuroprotective effects. Chai Hu contains saikosaponins with anti-anxiety properties. Long Gu and Mu Li provide calcium and minerals that support nervous system function. Studies demonstrate efficacy in anxiety disorders and mood stabilization.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for anxiety with alternating symptoms and mood swings. Particularly effective for people with hyperthyroid-like symptoms without actual thyroid disease. Often used in bipolar disorder support and menopausal anxiety. Best results when constitutional pattern matches shaoyang disturbance.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Cook minerals (Long Gu, Mu Li) first for 30 minutes, use Qian Dan sparingly
**Timing**: Between meals, evening dose for sleep issues
**Duration**: 2-8 weeks for acute symptoms, longer for chronic mood disorders
