## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
Simplest yet most effective formula for emotional lability. The three ingredients work synergistically to create stability - Gan Cao harmonizes, Xiao Mai nourishes heart spirit, Da Zao strengthens the center. Represents the gentle approach to mental-emotional disorders.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects. Gan Cao contains glycyrrhizin with mood-stabilizing properties. Xiao Mai provides B-vitamins and compounds that affect neurotransmitters. Da Zao contains cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with calming effects.

### Clinical Experience
Remarkably effective for "emotional storms" - sudden crying, mood swings, feeling overwhelmed. Often works within days for acute emotional crisis. Excellent for sensitive people who are easily overwhelmed by emotions.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, can increase Xiao Mai up to 60g for severe cases
**Preparation**: Gentle decoction (15-20 minutes), can be taken as syrup
**Timing**: Preferably between meals, extra dose during emotional crisis
**Duration**: 2-8 weeks for acute episodes, longer for chronic emotional instability
