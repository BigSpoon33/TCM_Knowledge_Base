106 Chapter 3 / Formulas that Harmonize

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula promotes the spreading out of yang qi, which
can cause headache, dizziness, and bleeding of the gums if
taken long term. These side effects can be reduced or elimi-
nated if the formula is prepared according to the directions
in the source text. For the same reason, unless considerably
modified, it is contraindicated in patients with excess above
and deficiency below, Liver fire, or bleeding of the gums. Use
with caution in cases of ascendant Liver yang, hypertension,
or vomiting of blood due to yin deficiency. Patients with rela-
tively weak normal gi may experience fever and chills while
taking this formula because the pathogenic influence is vent-
ed from the lesser yang warp via the greater yang.

Commentary

According to Discussion of Cold Damage, the common meth-
ods of treating externally-contracted diseases are inducing
sweating (to release the exterior) and purging or vomiting
(to expel interior accumulations). However, neither of these
approaches is appropriate for treating a lesser yang disorder.
The pathogenic influence is lodged too deeply in the interior
to be released by sweating, which would only injure the fluids
and the normal qi. Yet the pathogen has not penetrated deep
enough to justify purging, which would injure the yin and
could lead to palpitations with anxiety. Because the symptom
of chest fullness is due to qi constraint rather than pathogenic
accumulation, inducing vomiting is also inappropriate. This
would merely injure the yang of the chest and could lead to
palpitations. The preferred method, which unblocks the qi
dynamic to clear heat constraint, vents pathogens from the
lesser yang, and harmonizes fluid metabolism; it is known
as harmonization, or literally ‘harmonizing resolution’ (4 ##
he jie).

Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) and Harmonizing Resolution

A passage in Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica
explains the action of the chief herb in this formula, Bupleuri
Radix (chdi hi), and its role in the process of harmonizing
resolution:

Bupleuri Radix (chdi hu) has a bitter flavor and therefore
specifically focuses on pathogenic heat ... It grows in the early
spring, its qi is fragrant, and its character light and clear. With
both a light qi and flavor and an ascending, discharging nature
constitutionally received in the spring, it is thus completely
different, however, in both character and function from other
bitter, cooling, draining, and downward-directing herbs. ...
When pathogenic qi gradually enters into the interior and is no
longer located merely at the muscle layer and surface [of the
body] from which all other exterior-dispersing herbs can no
longer vent it, only Bupleuri Radix (chdi hu) with its clear and
light qi and aromatic fragrance is able to dredge and drain it,
guiding and lifting the pathogenic qi outward to be resolved via
the exterior. This is why Bupleuri Radix (chdi hi) is [included

among the herbs t
