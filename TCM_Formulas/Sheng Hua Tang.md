610 Chapter 13 / Formulas that Regulate the Blood

fire.” Another view is that it is primarily a corrective assis-
tant, controlling the warmth and dryness of Aconiti Radix
lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi) and Atractylodis macrocephalae
Rhizoma (bdi zhu). This view was stated by You Yi in Per-
sonal Standards for the Essentials from the Golden Cabinet:
“Considering that acrid, warm substances can, in turn, lead
to harm with bleeding disorders, one uses the bitterness and
cold of Scutellariae Radix (hudng qin) to prevent them from
overdoing it.” Yet another perspective, discussed by Huang
Huang in One-Hundred Classical Formulas, is that Scutellar-
iae Radix (hudng gin) excels at stopping bleeding and is used
here for that purpose alone. The ANALYSIS OF FORMULA
section above includes both interpretations, as they are not
mutually exclusive.

Comparisons
> Vs. RESTORE THE SPLEEN DECOCTION (gui pi tang)

Both formulas strengthen the Spleen and nourish the blood,
and both are used to treat bleeding due to the Spleen’s failure
to govern the blood. However, Restore the Spleen Decoction
(gui pf tang) focuses more on the Spleen qi, with herbs such
as Ginseng Radix (ren shen) and Astragali Radix (hudng qi),
and also emphasizes treatment of the root. By contrast, Yellow
Earth Decoction (hudng tu tang) focuses more on the Spleen
yang, with Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi), along
with a treatment principle that address both the root and the
branch.

> Vs, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER Powper (hudi hud sdn)

Both formulas treat blood in the stool. However, Sophora
Japonica Flower Powder (hudi hud sdn) focuses on treating
problems due to wind-heat or damp-heat, while Yellow Earth
Decoction (hudng ti tang) focuses on bleeding from a listless
Spleen yang that fails to govern the blood. Traditionally, the
bleeding from heat and stasis was thought to occur closer to
the anus, in part because of its urgency and the fact that it
preceded defecation, and was therefore called ‘near bleeding’
(2 da jin xue), while bleeding that was due to deficiency was
thought to occur farther up the digestive tract, since it fol-
lowed defecation, and was therefore called ‘distant bleeding’
(i do. yudin xue),

>» Vs. ARBORVITAE TWIG DECOCTION (bdi ye tang)

Both formulas treat bleeding due to yang deficiency of the
middle burner. However, while Arborvitae Twig Decoction
(bai ye tang) treats problems that also have an element of up-
ward-rebelling Stomach qi (hence vomiting or spitting up of
blood), Yellow Earth Decoction (hudng tu tang) treats those
with downward-sinking Spleen qi along with more significant
blood deficiency. Also, at present, Arborvitae Twig Decoction
(bdi ye tang) is usually taken as a component of a larger for-
mula to treat an appropriate condition, while Yellow Earth

Decoction (hudng tu tang), with its intertwining functions of
warming, clearing, tonifying, and plugging, is thought to be
more comprehensive and is commonly used as a treatment
for bleeding f
