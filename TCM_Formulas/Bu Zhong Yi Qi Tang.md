## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
Master formula for "middle qi sinking" - the concept that spleen qi becomes too weak to hold organs in place. Represents the perfect balance of tonifying without stagnation due to lifting herbs.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows immune-modulating effects, potential benefits for chronic fatigue, gastroptosis, and post-viral conditions. Huang Qi contains polysaccharides that support immune function.

### Clinical Experience
Particularly effective for patients with chronic fatigue who feel worse after eating (unlike blood deficiency fatigue). Best taken warm, preferably before meals. Results often seen within 2-3 weeks.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Decoction preferred for acute conditions, granules for maintenance
**Timing**: Before meals, when stomach is empty
**Duration**: 4-12 weeks for chronic conditions

## 📚 Study Notes & Memory Aids

### Key Learning Points
1. "Center-supplementing" refers to spleen/stomach (middle jiao)
2. Lifting herbs (Sheng Ma, Chai Hu) are essential for prolapse
3. Combination of tonifying + lifting makes this unique

### Memory Device
"LIFT the center: L-ift (Sheng Ma, Chai Hu), I-mmunity (Huang Qi), F-uel digestion (Ren Shen, Bai Zhu), T-onify blood (Dang Gui)"

### Common Exam Points
- Key indication: prolapse of organs
- Distinguished from Si Jun Zi Tang by addition of lifting herbs
- Pulse will be weak in middle position (stomach/spleen)

## 🔬 Research & Evidence
- Clinical trials show efficacy in chronic fatigue syndrome
- Studies demonstrate benefits for gastroptosis
- Research supports immune-modulating effects of Huang Qi component
