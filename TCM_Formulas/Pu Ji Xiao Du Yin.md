© Actions Moistens the Intestines and unblocks the bowels

Indications

Constipation, lusterless skin and nails, dry mouth with an
unquenchable thirst, a dry tongue, and a thin pulse.

This is constipation due to desiccated Intestines (#444
chang kit), a common condition among the elderly and de-
bilitated. It is also frequently seen after childbirth when the
loss of blood injures the yin and depletes the fluids. The other
signs and symptoms are characteristic of yin deficiency with
depleted fluids.

Analysis of Formula

This formula combines herbs that nourish the blood, enrich
the yin, and moisten the Intestines. Cannabis Semen (hud
md ren) and Persicae Semen (tdo ren) contain an abundance
of oils that moisten the Intestines and unblock the bowels.
The combination of these herbs is especially effective in cases
of constipation with yin deficiency. Angelicae sinensis Radix
(dang gui) nourishes the blood and moistens the desiccated
Intestines, Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di hudng) nourishes
the yin, the root of this condition. The qi-moving action of
Aurantii Fructus (zhi ke) reinforces the laxative effect of the
formula and prevents the cloying nature of the other herbs
from injuring the Spleen and Stomach.

Commentary

This formula may be used in treating many types of con-
stipation associated with debility. Key symptoms suggesting
its use are dry stools that are not difficult to pass and a thin
tongue with little or no coating. Because its actions are mild,
it does not always work quickly but may require extended use
for maximum effect. It should not be prescribed in cases that
require purging.

Comparisons

> Vs. Five-SEeD PILL (wit ren wdn) AND MOISTEN THE
INTESTINES PILL FROM DISCUSSION OF THE SPLEEN
AND STOMACH (riin cheng wan)

All of these formulas treat habitual constipation. Of the three,
Moisten the Intestines Pill from Discussion of the Spleen and
Stomach (rin chdng wan) is the strongest. It focuses spe-
cifically on nourishing the blood and eliminating wind-heat
clumping in the Intestines (BL43 feng jie). Five-Seed Pill (wu
ren wdn) moistens the Intestines and moves the qi with a rela-
tively large dosage of Citri reticulatae Pericarpium (chen pi).
It is thus inappropriate where the yin and blood have been
severely damaged and the qi is already excessive. Moisten the
Intestines Pill from Master Shen’s Book (ritn chang wan) is
the most strongly moistening and least moving formula of
the three. It is thus indicated for cases of blood and yin defi-
ciency but does not work as well in moving the qi.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders with long-
standing constipation.

constipation (usually severe) from injury to the Spleen and Stomach
due to wind-heat entering the Intestines or from improper diet or
overwork. This type of constipation includes aspects of blood de-
ficiency, blood stasis, and wind (due to blood deficiency). The gen-
eration of wind further desiccates the Intestines, thereby aggravating
the constipation. This formula is stronger than the principal formula,
and is indicated for more severe conditions.

Decaction. Nourishes the blood, softens the Liver, moistens dryness,
and unblocks the passage of stool. For constipation accompanied
by lower abdominal distention, lack of appetite, fatigue, and muscle
twitching. This formula was composed by the renowned modern
physician from Shanghai, Cheng Men-Xue. Its special characteristic
is the use of honey-fried Asteris Radix (z/ wdn), a strategy borrowed
from the Song-dynasty physician Shi Zai. The intention is to direct
the Lung qi downward so that it may facilitate the movement of gi
in the Intestines. This is assisted by herbs like Bupleuri Radix (chdi
hu), Aurantii Fructus (zhi ke), and Citri reticulatae Semen (ju he),
all of which focus the action of the formula on the lower abdomen
in different ways. In this manner, the moistening of blood facilitates
movement of the bowels.

Note: Mume Flos (mei hud) is bitter, slightly sweet, slight-
ly sour, and cold. It enters the Liver, Stomach, and Lung chan-
nels and dredges the Liver and resolves constraint, opens the
Stomach and generates fluids, and transforms phlegm. The
normal dosage in decoctions is 2-6g.

i Actions Moistens the Intestines, drains heat, promotes the
§ movement of qi, and unblocks the bowels

Indications

Constipation with hard stool that is difficult to expel, normal
to frequent urination, a dry, yellow tongue coating, and a sub-
merged, rapid or floating, choppy pulse.

This is a ‘Spleen bind’ (4## pi yue) pattern, as defined in
Discussion of Cold Damage. Its cause is heat-dryness block-
ing the physiological movement of fluids in the Spleen. The
Spleen is unable to distribute fluids to the extremities and
upward into the Lungs and, by association, the Intestines.
This causes the stools to become hard, Instead, the fluids seep
downward into the Bladder. Thus, urination is normal or even
increased. The dry, yellow tongue coating reflects the deple-
tion of fluids and slight heat in the interior. The submerged,
rapid pulse indicates heat in the interior. A floating, chop-
py pulse may also appear, indicating dryness as an external
pathogen causing stagnation of fluid movement in the body.

Analysis of Formula

To address the problems of heat-dryness causing stagnation
of qi, the formula focuses on moistening dryness in the Intes-
tines, draining the heat, and moving the qi. This is achieved
with a variation of Minor Order the Qi Decoction (xido cheng
qi tang) in which the dosage of those herbs that strongly dis-
perse and purge has been reduced, while herbs that nourish
and moisten have been added as chief and deputies.

The chief herb, Cannabis Semen (hud md ren), is rich in
oils that moisten the Intestines and unblock the bowels. One
of the deputies, Armeniacae Semen (xing ren), directs the qi
downward and moistens the Intestines. It, too, contains oils
that facilitate bowel movement. The other deputy, Paeoniae
Radix (shdo yao), is bitter, sour, and slightly cold. It enters
the Spleen, nourishes the yin, and harmonizes the interior.


82 Chapter 2 / Formulas that Drain Downward

Aurantii Fructus immaturus (zhi shi), an assistant, breaks up
accumulation (especially in the Intestines). Magnoliae offici-
nalis Cortex (heu pd), another assistant, removes fullness and
distention. The third assistant, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da
hudng), is a purgative. Honey, used as a medium in forming
the pills, plays an active role by moistening the Intestines, but
mainly acts as the envoy whose sweetness harmonizes the ac-
tions of the other herbs.

Cautions and Contraindications

Because most of the herbs in this formula possess draining,
dispersing, or purgative properties, it should not be used
without modification for treating the very weak or for con-
stipation due solely to blood deficiency. Contraindicated dur-
ing pregnancy.

Commentary

The definition of the ‘Spleen bind’ pattern in paragraph 247
of Discussion of Cold Damage is extremely brief: “When the
dorsal pedis pulse is floating and choppy along with frequent
urination and hard bowel movements, the Spleen is bound.
Hemp Seed Pill (md zi ren wdn) masters it.” Given the limited
nature of this passage, successive generations of commenta-
tors have added their own interpretations.

The earliest commentator on this book was Cheng Wu-
Ji. In Discussion Illuminating the Principles of Cold Damage,
he defined the word binding (#4 yue) as “being bound by a
contract or pact” (44 #9 jie yue) or “being controlled or domi-
nated” (29.3% yue shiz). He went on to say that here:

The Stomach is strong and the Spleen is weak. | As the Spleen]
governs the [movement of] fluids, they are not distributed to
the four extremities but transported to the Bladder. As a conse-
quence, urination is frequent and the stool is hard. Therefore,
one says that the Spleen [in such a case] is bound.

While this clearly states that the pathology is one of the prob-
lems with fluid transportation due to Stomach excess, his un-
fortunate insertion of the notion of a weak Spleen caused
much confusion among later writers. Some physicians—fore-
most among them Zhu Dan-Xi—took this to mean that dry-
heat had damaged the Spleen, or even that blood or yin had
become deficient. As a result, some physicians have prescribed
this formula for the treatment of chronic constipation in the
weak and elderly. However, the emphasis of the formula is
clearly on removing excess. Even the moistening herbs in the
formula are primarily intended to move stagnation and not
to enrich yin or generate fluids. In Writings on the Esteemed
Discussion, the Ming-dynasty physician Yu Chang therefore
severely criticized this mistake:

Should not a weak Spleen be tonified? Why then does Hemp
Seed Pill (md zi ren wdn) contain herbs contrary [to this inten-
tion] like Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng), Aurantii Fructus
immaturus (zhi shi), and Magnoliae officinalis Cortex (hou

po)? ... [Zhang] Zhong-Jing said ‘strong Stomach’ The original
text never mentioned a‘weak Spleen. The fact is that when [the
original] talks about a strong Stomach, what it really means by
strong is that the Spleen is strong. To bind [means] to econo-
mize. If the Spleen qi is excessively strong, it will economize

by expelling the food taken in by the Stomach over three to

five days in only one or two pellets. Altogether, [this pattern] is
one where earth is excessively dry causing the fluids within the
Stomach and Intestines to become daily more dessicated, hence
the stools become difficult [to expel]. If the Spleen qi were
weak, this would cause diarrhea. What could be the reason for
making such stools difficult to expel?

The manner in which this formula modifies Minor Order
the Qi Decoction (xido cheng qi tang), and the preference
for prescribing it in pill form, make it a relatively mild laxa-
tive. Nevertheless, it is inappropriate for all types of chronic
constipation. As the early 20th-century physician Yun Tie-
Qiao stated in Notated Discussion of Cold Damage Edited for
Meaning: “Compared to the Order the Qi Decoctions (cheng
gi tang), Hemp Seed Pill (md zi ren wan) is relatively mild.
However, one [still] must use it [only to treat] yang patterns.
If one mistakenly employs it for yin patterns, its mildness
turns into violence.”

Drawing on these discussions as well as his own clinical
experience, Chen Zhao-Zu, the modern physician and writer
of formula textbooks, suggests three main uses of this for-
mula in contemporary practice:

1. Constipation in the elderly, debilitated, or postpartum or
other contexts involving loss of blood or essence, charac-
terized by signs of excess in the yang brightness, but where
strong purgation is contraindicated

2. Patients suffering from hemorrhoids who require laxative
treatment that does not aggravate the condition

3. Patients who do not exercise but who are neither exces-
sively deficient nor have pronounced signs of damp-heat
in the Intestines. Another important indication in contem-
porary practice is postoperative constipation due to heat
and dryness.

The early 20th-century physician Cao Ying-Fu used this for-
mula for constipation that is accompanied by sweating or
a moist skin. In these cases, such sweating constitutes the
equivalent of relatively excessive urination rather than the
heat-type sweating associated with yang brightness organ-
warp patterns. However, the inclusion of moistening herbs
such as Cannabis Semen (hud md ren), Armeniacae Semen
(xing ren), and Paeoniae Radix (shdo yao) in this formula
indicates that, irrespective of the presence of sweat, the skin
itself may also be dry.

Comparison

> Vs. MINOR ORDER THE Q1 DECOCTION
(xido cheng qi tang)


Formulas that Moisten the Intestines and Unblock the Bowels 83

Compared to patterns of heat excess in the yang brightness
organs with clumping of the stools, which is treated by Mi-
nor Order the Qi Decoction (xido cheng qi tang), the Spleen
bind pattern treated by Hemp Seed Pill (md zi ren wan) is
milder and often more chronic. Nevertheless, it is a pattern
of excess.

Yang brightness organ patterns are due to severe heat
causing clumping of the stools and stagnation of qi. Dryness
is secondary to this obstruction. Thus, it can be resolved by
simply flushing the Stomach and Intestines and breaking the
qi stagnation. In a Spleen bind pattern, dryness is the primary
pathogen. This inhibits the movement of stool in the bowels
and leads to qi stagnation, but does not cause acute clumping.
Thus, it is resolved by a strategy of moistening the Intestines
combined with mild purgation.

> Vs, Five-SEED PIL (wii ren wen)

On the other hand, the ‘dessicated Intestines’ patterns treated
by Five-Seed Pill (wi ren wdn) and its modifications, includ-
ing Moisten the Intestines Pill from Master Shen’s Book (riin
chang wan), and also by Benefit the River [Flow] Decoction
(ji chudn jidn), are patterns where dryness of the stools is
caused by deficiency of blood, essence, or body fluids.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a wide variety of biomedically-defined disorders, pri-
marily those affecting the digestive system such as incomplete
intestinal obstruction, postoperative ileus, atrophic gastritis,
reflux gastritis, hemorrhoids, bleeding post-hemorrhoidec-
tomy, habitual constipation, constipation in the elderly, or
postpartum constipation. It has also been used to treat car-
diopulmonary disease, asthma, cystitis, coronary heart dis-
ease, and diabetes.
