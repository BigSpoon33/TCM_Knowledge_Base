## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
"Xiang Sha Liu Jun Zi" adds aromatic qi-regulating herbs to Liu Jun Zi Tang for cases where spleen qi deficiency is complicated by qi stagnation. The aromatic herbs (Mu Xiang and Sha Ren) prevent the tonifying herbs from causing stagnation while enhancing their digestive benefits. Perfect for weak digestion with bloating and distension.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows gastroprokinetic, anti-inflammatory, and digestive enzyme-enhancing effects. The qi-tonifying herbs support gastric function while aromatic herbs promote gastric motility. Studies demonstrate benefits in functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, and chronic gastritis. The combination helps restore normal digestive physiology.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for chronic digestive weakness with bloating and poor appetite. Particularly effective for people who feel worse after eating heavy or tonifying foods. Often provides improvement within 1-2 weeks for digestive symptoms. Best results when combined with dietary modifications to support spleen function.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, Sha Ren added near end of cooking
**Timing**: Before meals to enhance digestive function
**Duration**: 4-12 weeks for chronic conditions, often long-term for constitutional support
