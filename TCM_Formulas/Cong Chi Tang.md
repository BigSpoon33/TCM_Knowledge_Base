# and regulates the nutritive and protective qi

Indications

Fever and chills unrelieved by sweating, headache, aversion to
wind, stiff neck, nasal congestion, dry heaves, no particular
thirst, a thin, white, and moist tongue coating, and a floating
pulse that is either lax or frail. May also be used for a similar
presentation in patients not suffering from an external inva-
sion.

This is externally-contracted wind-cold or wind attack
(? BL zhong feng), a condition characterized by disharmony
between the nutritive and protective qi. Under normal cir-
cumstances, the two regulate and support each other. The
protective qi (associated with yang) guards the exterior and
prevents leakage of nutritive gi to the outside. The nutritive
qi (associated with yin) nourishes and stabilizes the interior,
regulating the function of protective qi as well as constituting
a reservoir for it. In case of wind attack, this mutual regula-
tion and support is lost. When the protective qi rises to the
surface to fend off the invading pathogenic qi, fever and chills
are produced. Agitated by the externally-contracted wind, it
is unable to adequately perform its other functions, such as
guarding the nutritive qi. The nutritive qi thereupon becomes
unstable and is unable to contain the fluids. The resulting
sweating does not have the full force of the protective qi be-
hind it, and thus does not lead to any improvement in the
condition.

The opening of the interstices and pores (during sweat-
ing) makes one more sensitive to the environment, which
leads to an aversion or sensitivity to wind. When wind-cold
invades the muscles and the exterior, it impedes the flow of qi
in the channels (especially the greater yang channels), which
leads to headache and stiff neck. The Lungs control the qi and
are associated with the skin, body hair, and nose. Wind-cold,
which fetters or ‘bottles up’ the exterior, also impairs the qi
mechanism of the Lungs, which causes nasal congestion. The
impaired gi mechanism of the Lungs and the loss of mutual
regulation between the nutritive and protective qi disrupts
the Stomach qi, which leads to dry heaves.

As is typical of fever due to exterior cold, there is no
particular thirst. The thin, white tongue coating and floating
pulse are also characteristic of exterior wind-cold. Sweating
‘opens up’ the superficial levels of the body, which is reflected
in a relaxation of the
