### Traditional Understanding
"Sheng Mai" means "generate the pulse" - referring to restoring pulse strength in conditions of qi and yin collapse. Classic formula for summer heat patterns and chronic weakness with excessive fluid loss. The three-herb combination perfectly balances qi tonification, yin nourishment, and fluid preservation.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows adaptogenic, cardiotonic, and stress-protective effects. Ren Shen provides ginsenosides that enhance cellular energy and stress resistance. Mai Men Dong contains polysaccharides that support fluid balance and tissue hydration. Wu Wei Zi provides lignans with hepatoprotective and stress-adapting properties.

### Clinical Experience
Remarkably effective for exhaustion with sweating and thirst. Often provides immediate relief for heat exhaustion and chronic fatigue. Particularly useful for people who sweat excessively or lose fluids easily. Best results when taken regularly during hot weather or periods of high stress.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Light decoction to preserve delicate herbs
**Timing**: Can be taken frequently during acute exhaustion, regular doses for chronic conditions
**Duration**: As needed for acute conditions, 4-8 weeks for chronic patterns
