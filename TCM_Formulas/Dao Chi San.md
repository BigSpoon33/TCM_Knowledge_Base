Formulas that Drive Out Excess Water 9]

Suspended, thin mucus accumulates below the ribs, a region
closely associated with the function of the Gallbladder and
Liver, whose rising qi is in the ascendancy at daybreak. From
this perspective, too, the early moning indicates the most fa-
vorable time for treatment.

There may also be cold and painful extremities, unrelenting and
severe headache, lethargy with a desire to sleep, a loss of desire for
food and drink, coughing up of thick, sticky sputum, and a rattling
sound in the throat at night or excessive salivation. While both this

pain in these areas, abdominal distention, and edema. The word
‘mucus in the formula’s name refers to heavy fluids in general, or to
phlegm and thin mucus in particular.
