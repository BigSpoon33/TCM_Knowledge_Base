642 Chapter 14 / Formulas that Expel Wind

(dai zhe shi), Fossilia Ossis Mastodi (leng gui), and Ostreae
Concha (mii li). Depending on the pathodynamic, these are
combined with ingredients from one or more of the following
groups:

¢ Substances that clear fire and drain heat such as Gardeniae
Fructus (zhi zi), Gypsum fibrosum (shf gdo), Scutellariae
Radix (hudng gin), Glauberitum (hdn shui shi), or Talcum
(hud sht). This is important where blazing fire stirs up in-
ternal wind.

¢ Substances that enrich yin and nourish blood such as
Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di hudng), Paeoniae Radix alba
(bdi shdo), Scrophulariae Radix (xudn shen), Testudinis
Plastrum (gui ben), or Asini Corii Colla (e jido). This is nec-
essary in cases where external or internal fire has depleted
the essence, leading to yin deficiency with yang excess, or
where internal wind is associated with blood deficiency.

¢ Substances that calm the spirit such as Poriae Sclerotium
pararadicis (fu shen), Polygoni multiflori Caulis (ye jido
teng), Fossilia Ossis Mastodi (Ideng gti), or Ostreae Concha
(mii li). Whether viewed in terms of the close relationship
between the ethereal soul and the spirit, or from a five-
phase perspective where wood excess invariably damages
fire, disorders of the spirit such as irritability, agitation, or
even loss of consciousness are common consequences of
wind disorders and must be addressed. For this purpose,
but also in order to control the upward-rushing of Liver
yang, substances that extinguish wind are frequently either
themselves heavy in nature, for example, Haliotidis Concha
(shi jue ming), Haematitum (dai zhe shi), or Ostreae Con-
cha (mu li); or they are combined with substances that can
anchor the aberrant yang, such as Testudinis Plastrum (gui
ban) and Trionycis Carapax (bie jid).
