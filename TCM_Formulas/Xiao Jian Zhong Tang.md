Formulas that invigorate the Blood and Dispel Blood Stasis 569

Indications

Sequelae of wind-stroke including hemiplegia, paralysis, and
atrophy of the lower limbs, facial paralysis, slurred speech,
drooling, dry stools, urinary frequency or incontinence, a
white tongue coating, and a moderate pulse. The source text
also prescribes the formula for atrophy disorders with the
same underlying mechanism.

This is qi deficiency leading to blood stasis obstructing
the channels. This impairs the movement of qi and the pro-
vision of nourishment by the blood. The sinews, blood ves-
sels, muscles, and flesh are thereby deprived of nourishment,
which manifests as hemiplegia, paralysis, and atrophy of the
lower limbs, and facial paralysis. The deficiency of qi and
stasis of blood likewise deprive the tongue of its nourishment
and strength, which manifests as slurred speech and drooling.
Deficiency of yang qi inhibits the descent of the Stomach qi
and obstructs the gi of the yang organs. This results in the
passage of dry stools because of the extended transit time
through the yang organs and thus the increased absorption of
fluids from the stool. And because it is the transforming func-
tion of qi that stabilizes and retains the fluids, the deficiency
of gi also accounts for the urinary frequency or incontinence.
The white tongue coating and moderate pulse are indicative
of qi deficiency. Atrophy disorder characterized by weakness
or flaccidity of the muscles can be due to the same pathody-
namic.

Analysis of Formula

When qi deficiency is the cause of blood stasis, deficiency
is the root and excess is the branch of the disorder. In such
cases, simply tonifying the qi will not fully eliminate the stasis
of blood. Accordingly, this formula strongly tonifies the qi,
while relying on a smaller dosage of ingredients that invigo-
rate the blood to dispel the stasis in the vessels and collaterals.
This approach eliminates blood stasis without injuring the
normal qi. The chief ingredient is Astragali Radix (hudng qi),
which strongly tonifies the primal qi. The dosage of this herb
is five times as much as that of all the other herbs added to-
gether. This indicates that tonifying the qi is the clear priority
in treating this pattern.

All of the other herbs focus on the blood. Angelicae si-
nensis radicis Cauda (dang gui wei), Chuanxiong Rhizoma
(chudn xieng), and Paeoniae Radix rubra (chi shdo) invigo-
rate the blood and harmonize the nutritive qi. Because they
tonify as well as move, they serve as deputies in the formula.
The assistants, Persicae Semen (tdo ren), Carthami Flos (heng
hua), and Pheretima (di leng), invigorate the blood, dispel
blood stasis, and unblock the channels. Pheretima (di Idng)
is especially useful for unblocking and invigorating the chan-
nels and collaterals. In concert with Astragali Radix (hudng
qi), it moves the qi throughout the body.

Cautions and Contraindications

Because this formula breaks up and eliminates blood stasis, it
is contraindicated immediately after a stroke when the cause
is cerebral hemorrhage. Until the etiology is established and
cerebral hemorrhage has been ruled out, one should refrain
from using this formula.

The contemporary physician Zhang Xi-Chun argues that
the formula should only be used if the pulse is empty and
forceless. It is therefore contraindicated in wind-stroke pa-
tients who have a big and forceful, or firm, wiry, and forceful
pulse, or in cases of yin deficiency and hot blood, or during
pregnancy.

Before using this formula one must be sure that the pa-
tient has regained clear consciousness, the body temperature
is normal, there is no hemorrhage, and the pulse is moderate.
Herbal therapy may be required long-term, as its effects are
generally slow and incremental.

Commentary

This formula is another example of Wang Qing-Ren’s ap-
proach to the treatment of disease based on his revision of
classical anatomy and physiology, discussed above in the
COMMENTARY to Drive Out Stasis from the Mansion of
Blood Decoction (xue fu zhi yit tang). As explained there,
Wang focused on the interaction of qi and blood as the key to
treating any disorder. Tonify the Yang to Restore Five-Tenths
Decoction (bu ydng hudn wii ting) applies this approach to
the treatment of hemiplegia, paralysis, atrophy disorders, and
similar symptoms.

Wang Qing-Ren’s Conception of Hemiplegia
Previous generations of physicians had attributed hemiple-
gia to wind-stroke. This was thought to be caused either by
wind entering into the vessels, collaterals, and ultimately or-
gans from without—the so-called ‘true wind-stroke’ (#L ¥
BA zhen zhong feng)—or by internal wind due to heat, yin
deficiency, Liver yang excess, or similar pathologies, often ac-
companied by phlegm—the so-called ‘wind-type stroke (4
? WA, [ei zhong feng). Wang rejected these ideas as incompat-
ible with his anatomical studies and declared that the treat-
ment strategies derived from them were not very effective
in clinical practice. In his opinion, hemiplegia and paralysis
were due to qi deficiency, which deprived the muscles of the
nourishment from blood: “When the primal qi is deficient,
it no longer reaches into the blood vessels. Without qi, the
blood vessels stop [moving blood, which leads to] stasis.” In
Wang's writings, the primal qi and yang are different terms
used to describe the same substance: “Primal qi is fire, fire is
primal qi. This fire is the source of life in the human body.”
Wang’s anatomical findings convinced him that this qi
was produced in the ‘mansion of gi’ (most likely the greater
omentum) from which it was distributed throughout the body
via the ‘protective qi main pipe’ (#148 # wei zeng gudn). Run-


570 Chapter 13 / Formulas that Regulate the Blood

ning parallel to the ‘nutritive qi main pipe (RMA reng zing
gudn), qi moved the blood while blood was the substance on
which qi acted by means of its warmth and dynamic. That
these structures branched symmetrically into smaller vessels
that supplied both sides of the body convinced Wang that
hemiplegia was due to qi deficiency:

The primal qi is stored in the qi pipes, which distribute it
throughout the body with the left and right sides [each] receiv-
ing half. [The capacity] of a person to walk, sit, move, or turn
depends entirely on this primal qi. If the primal qi is sufficient,
[these actions] have power. If it is insufficient, they lack power.
If it is cut off, one dies. [If we imagine that a person possesses]
ten parts of primal qi and two parts are exhausted so that eight
remain, then each side [of the body] gets four parts. [This is
still sufficient] for no disease to occur. If five parts are ex-
hausted and five parts remain, then each side of the body only
gets two-and-a-half parts. At this stage, even though hemiplegia
may not necessarily occur, there will be symptoms of qi exhaus-
tion. However, because it does not hurt or itch, a person may
be unaware of it. As soon as the primal qi becomes exhausted,
the vessels and collaterals naturally empty. Given these empty
spaces, it is unavoidable that the qi will move to merge on one
side. If the two-and-a-half parts [of qi] on the right side move
toward the left, the right side will have no qi. Conversely, if the
two-and-a-half parts [of qi] on the left side move toward the
right, the left side will have no qi. If there is no qi, one cannot
move, Being unable to move is called hemiplegia.

Wang Qing-Ren gave a similar explanation for paralysis
(where the lower part of the body is deprived of qi) and the
other symptoms for which this formula is indicated.

Connections to the Tradition

The appropriate therapeutic strategy here is to tonify the qi
and invigorate the blood. The very large dosage of Astragali
Radix (hudng qi) used for this purpose demonstrates that
Wang, despite positioning himself as a radical innovator, in
this case used an approach that is deeply rooted in tradition.
As Zhang Xi-Chun noted in his comment on this formula in
Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the
Western, “This formula uses 120g of Astragali Radix (hudng
qt) to harshly tonify the qi aspect. This is [based] on Li Dong-
Yuan's doctrine regarding the importance of qi.”

The use of Astragali Radix (hudng qf) for hemiplegia and
similar disorders goes back at least to the 17th-century text,
Indispensable Tools for Pattern Treatment. In this work, Wang
Ken-Tang observed:

Although there are many causes for sudden falling and hemi-
plegia patterns, there is none that is not due to the failure of the
true qi to circulate [as it should]. Therefore, Astragali Radix
(hudng qi) is the chief herb that must be employed [in treating
such patterns]. Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng) must be used
as deputy. Astragali Radix (hudng qi) supports the true qi, while
Saposhnikoviae Radix (fdng feng} transports the support of
true qi by Astragali Radix (hudng qf) around the entire body. It
also has the power to treat wind.

Wang Qing-Ren borrowed this strategy without acknowledg-
ing its source. In his instructions regarding the use of Tonify
the Yang to Restore Five[-Tenths] Decoction (bi ydng hudn
wil tang), Wang recommends that in the early stages of hemi-
plegia, it may be useful to add Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang
feng) for up to five days. He also recommends to gradually
increase the dosage of Astragali Radix (hudng qf) over a num-
ber of days. Most often, therefore, contemporary physicians
begin with a dosage of 30-60g or even lower, and increase this
until they achieve the desired effect. Wang also admonishes
that once the symptoms have disappeared, one must continue
taking the formula once or twice a week in order to ensure
that the symptoms do not recur.

If the use of Astragali Radix (hudng qf) is borrowed from
Wang Ken-Tang, the relative dosage of gi and blood herbs in
Wang Qing-Ren’s formulas reflects the influence of Li Shi-
Zhen. In Comprehensive Outline of the Materia Medica, Li
had claimed that herbs like Carthami Flos (heng hud) and
Persicae Semen (tdo ren) “invigorate the blood [when used]
in small doses, but break up blood [stasis when used] in
large doses.” Thus, formulas such as Drive Out Stasis from
the Mansion of Blood Decoction (xue fui zhui yu tang) contain
large amounts of blood-regulating herbs, while Tonify the
Yang to Restore Five [-Tenths] Decoction (bu ydng hudn wit
tang) makes do with much smaller amounts. Wang Qing-Ren
applied the same principle to his use of gi tonics, which ac-
cords with popular sayings such as “Astragali Radix (hudng
qi) invigorates [the blood] in small doses and tonifies [the qi]
in large doses,’ and “Astragali Radix (hudng qt) directs [the
qi] upward in small doses, and directs [the blood] downward
in large doses.”

Modern Usage

In clinical practice, using a large dose of warming, qi-tonify-
ing substances poses a theoretical risk of raising the blood
pressure, although this formula is generally not thought to
have this effect. Still, some contemporary physicians argue
that Gypsum fibrosum (shf geo) and Haematitum (dai zhe
shi) should be added to this formula to counteract its effect
in raising blood pressure. Moreover, modern physicians have
expanded its use to a range of conditions not indicated in the
source text, including edema due to qi deficiency and blood
stasis. For edema, the contemporary writer Chen Chao-Zu
recommends combining this formula with True Warrior
Decoction (zhen wii tang), discussed in Chapter 16. Other
modern uses of the formula are noted in the BIOMEDICAL
INDICATIONS below.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a wide variety of biomedically-defined disorders.

Actions Invigorates the blood, dispels blood stasis, spreads the
Liver qi, and unblocks the channels


$72 Chapter 13 / Formulas that Regulate the Blood

Indications

Excruciating pain associated with traumatic injury, especially
in the chest, hypochondria, or flanks.

This is traumatic physical injury that results in blood
leaving the vessels. The overflow of blood from the vessels
remains localized and forms an internal obstruction, which
causes pain. This formula is primarily used in treating such
pain in the chest, hypochondria, or flanks, which are tra-
versed by the Liver and Gallbladder channels. In addition, be-
cause the Liver stores the blood, it should be treated irrespec-
tive of which channel is injured and causes blood stasis. The
impairment of circulation in the hypochondria and flanks
due to the stasis of blood in turn causes the qi to stagnate.
This combination of severe blood stasis and qi stagnation
results in excruciating pain.

Analysis of Formula

Among the chief ingredients are Angelicae sinensis Radix
(dang gui), Persicae Semen (tdo ren), Carthami Flos (heng
hua), and Manitis Squama (chudn shdn jid). All are very ef-
fective for invigorating the blood, dispelling blood stasis, re-
ducing swelling, alleviating pain, and unblocking the chan-
nels. Manitis Squama (chudn shan jid) is particularly effective
in breaking up stasis of blood and unblocking the channels.
The last of the chief ingredients, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da
hudng), is treated with wine to enhance its three-fold action
in treating this condition: (1) to cleanse the coagulation of
static and decayed blood downward, pushing out the stale
blood to make way for the new; (2) to strengthen the ac-
tions of the chief ingredients in invigorating the blood and
dispelling blood stasis; and (3) to relax the middle burner
and direct the qi downward in order to assist in unblocking
the ascending and descending movements in the thorax that
remove the constrained gi and stasis of blood. Treating this
herb with wine and decocting it together with the other in-
gredients reduces its purgative action.

The deputy, Trichosanthis Radix (tian hud fen), is de-
scribed in various classical materia medica as able to treat
traumatic physical injury because of its ability to promote the
growth of new tissue and reduce swelling. In its dual capacity
as an assistant ingredient, it enters the blood level and helps
reduce the stasis of blood and disperse the accumulations that
cause swelling. It also clears heat and moistens dryness, both
of which may result from the chronic constraint of qi and
blood. Another assistant, Bupleuri Radix (chdi hu), spreads
the Liver qi, promotes the movement of qi, and guides the
other herbs into the Liver channel in order to treat pain and
distention in the chest, hypochondria, or flanks. With Rhei
Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng), this combination provides
one ascending and one descending herb in order to restore
the functional activities of qi. The envoy, Glycyrrhizae Radix

(gan cdo), relaxes spasms and alleviates pain, and regulates
and harmonizes the functions of the other ingredients.

Cautions and Contraindications

Contraindicated during pregnancy. If administering this for-
mula leads to diarrhea without a complete cure, one should
switch to a different formula.

Commentary

This formula was composed by Li Dong-Yuan to treat severe
pain in the flanks caused by injury from falling from a height.
Since then, it has become established as one of the most im-
portant formulas for the treatment of traumatic injury. Its
use is indicated under the following conditions: the problem
must be due to trauma; the pain must be in the chest, hypo-
chondria, or flanks; and the pathology must be one of blood
stasis, that is, the pain should be fixed and should increase
with pressure. The pulse is usually choppy, wiry, and/or sub-
merged.

Controversies

There are various interpretations of the functions and inter-
actions of the ingredients in this formula. For example, some
commentators feel that only Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da
hudng) and Persicae Semen (tdeo ren), which together invigo-
rate the blood and eliminate stasis, should be designated as
the chief ingredients. In this view, the relatively large dosage
of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) signals its primary role
in moving the blood, while Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang
gui), Carthami Flos (heng hud), and Manitis Squama (chudn
shan jid) merely assist the two chief ingredients in perform-
ing these functions. Others believe that Bupleuri Radix (chdi
hit) and Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui), or Rhei Radix et
Rhizoma (da hudng) and Bupleuri Radix (chdi hu), should be
regarded as the chief ingredients. Yet another opinion holds
that the sole purpose of Bupleuri Radix (chdi hu) is to guide
the other herbs into the Liver channel, rather than to spread
the Liver qi itself. The analysis above follows that of Fei Bo-
Xiong in Discussion of Medical Formulas:

The primary strategy for treating traumatic injury is to break
up [blood] stasis. The second [most important] strategy is to
move the qi, followed by generating new [blood and tissue].
This formula is especially fine because it adds one or two herbs
that move the qi.

Usage

Contemporary physicians have expanded the use of this for-
mula to treat severe pain not directly caused by trauma, but
in the area traversed by the Liver and Gallbladder channels,
such as headache or postherpetic neuralgia. In combination
with Seven-Thousandths of a Tael Powder (qi Ii sein), it is also
used to facilitate the healing of fractures.
