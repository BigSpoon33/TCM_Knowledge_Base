Formulas that Tonify the Qi and Blood 347

= Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi shdo).................. 30g (12-15g)
Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui).............. 30g (12-15g)
_ Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chuan xieng)............... 30g (6-9g)

Method of Preparation The source text advises to grind the
herbs into a coarse powder and prepare as a draft by boiling

9g of the powder in 200m! of water together with 5 slices of
Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jidng) and 1 piece of Jujubae
Fructus (de zdo). At present, it is usually prepared as a decoc-
tion with the dosage specified in parentheses. Codonopsis Radix
§ (ddng shen) is usually substituted for Ginseng Radix (ren shen) at
@ 2-3 times its dosage.

| Actions Tonifies and augments the qi and blood

Indications

Pallid or sallow complexion, palpitations with anxiety that
may be continuous, reduced appetite, shortness of breath,
laconic speech, extremities that are easily fatigued, lighthead-
edness and/or vertigo, a pale tongue with a white coating,
and a pulse which is either thin and frail or large, deficient,
and without strength.

This is concurrent deficiency of the gi and blood, most
often due to imbalances caused by chronic disease or exces-
sive loss of blood. The Lungs control the body’s gi; when the
qi is deficient, the Lung qi will also be deficient. This mani-
fests as shortness of breath and laconic speech. A poor ap-
petite is almost a pathognomonic sign of Spleen qi deficiency.
In this case, the Spleen qi is too weak to transform and trans-
port nutrients to the extremities. When this is combined with
blood deficiency, the extremities are easily fatigued. Concur-
rent deficiency of the qi and blood also prevents nourishment
(the clear yang and the blood) from reaching the head and
Heart. This leads to palpitations (which may be continuous),
lightheadedness and/or vertigo, and a pallid or sallow com-
plexion. The complexion will be more pallid if the condition
is primarily one of qi deficiency, and more sallow if blood
deficiency predominates. The pale tongue with a white coat-
ing combines signs of blood and qi deficiency. If blood defi-
ciency predominates, the pulse will be thin and frail, and if qi
deficiency predominates, the pulse will be large, deficient, and
without strength.

Analysis of Formula

To treat patterns caused by both qi and blood deficiency, this
formula pays equal attention to both. All the chief herbs are
warming in nature. Ginseng Radix (ren shen) augments the
qi, and Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di hudng) nour-
ishes the blood. Two of the deputies, Atractylodis macro-
cephalae Rhizoma (bdi zhti) and Poria (fu ling), strengthen
the Spleen and dry or leach-out dampness, thereby assist-
ing Ginseng Radix (ren shen) in strengthening the qi of the
Spleen and Lungs. The other deputies, Paeoniae Radix alba
(bdi shdo) and Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui), nourish
the blood and thereby reinforce the action of Rehmanniae
Radix preparata (shi di hudng).

One of the assistants, Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chuan
xiong), invigorates the blood and promotes the movement
of qi. The other, Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata (zhi gan cdo),
augments the qi and harmonizes the middle burner. The en-
voys are Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jidng) and Jujubae
Fructus (da zdo), which regulate the absorptive function of
the Stomach and Spleen. This is especially important because
it allows the other herbs in the formula to be absorbed. The
envoys also regulate the relationship between the protective
and nutritive qi, which allows a patient suffering from defi-
ciency to recover without developing other problems.

Commentary

This formula is a combination of Four-Gentlemen Decoction
(si jain zi tang) and Four-Substance Decoction (si wit tang).
The reader is referred to those formulas for a more complete
discussion of the interaction among the ingredients. Because
one of these formulas tonifies the qi and the other one the
blood, most commentators interpret the combined formulas
as simply additive. The one exception is the modern physician
Zhang Shan-Lei, who views the formula as acting primarily
on the middle burner, as discussed in this passage from An-
notated and Corrected Synopsis of Shen’s Women’s Disorders:

Based on the physiological function of the ingredients, one can
say that Four-Gentlemen Decoction (si jiin zi tang) [consists of]
qi herbs, which are able to support the Spleen yang. Four-Sub-
stance Decoction (si wi tang) [consists of] blood herbs, which
are able to nourish the Spleen yin. The former relates to qi, the
latter to blood. Hence, one can explain [this formula] as focus-
ing on the Spleen and Stomach, and one need not just general-
ize about Four-Gentlemen Decoction (si jtin zi tang) tonifying
qi and Four-Substance Decoction (si wi: tang) tonifying blood.

If one examines the original indications of the formula, there
is some justification for Zhang’s focus on the middle burner.
These are listed in the source texts as abdominal pain, com-
plete disinterest in food, frailty of the yin and yang organs,
diarrhea, hardness and pain in the lower abdomen, and pe-
riodic chills and fevers. Furthermore, although originally a
women’s formula, it has long been used to treat any pattern
in both men and women where both the qi and blood are de-
ficient. The presentation may include chills and fever, weight
loss, abscesses that neither suppurate nor improve, and con-
tinuous spotting from uterine bleeding.

® Actions Warms and tonifies the qi and blood

Indications

A wan complexion, fatigue, reduced appetite, dizziness, list-
lessness, dyspnea, palpitations, spontaneous sweating, night
sweats, cold extremities, spermatorrhea, a pale tongue, and
a thin and frail pulse. The formula is also used to treat sores
that do not heal, irregular periods, or continuous spotting
from uterine bleeding.

This is combined qi and blood deficiency, often seen in
consumptive disorders. When the qi is deficient, the entire
body loses its warmth and nourishment, leading to symptoms
like fatigue, listlessness, dyspnea, spontaneous sweating, cold
extremities, and a frail pulse. When the blood is deficient,
the organs, channels, and collaterals are no longer moistened
and nourished, leading to symptoms like a wan complexion,
dizziness, palpitations, night sweats, a pale tongue, and a thin
pulse. If the qi and blood fail to nourish the Penetrating and
Conception vessels, the sea of blood becomes empty, lead-
ing to irregular periods and uterine bleeding in women, and
to spermatorrhoea in men. If the muscle sinews, bones, and
joints are not nourished, this leads to sores that do not heal.

Analysis of Formula

This formula is a combination of Four-Gentlemen Decoction
(si jin zi tang), the primary formula for tonifying the qi, and
Four-Substance Decoction (si wi tang), the primary formula
for tonifying the blood, to which Astragali Radix (hudng qi)


Formulas that Tonify the Qi and Blood 349

and Cinnamomi Cortex (rou gui) have been added. Sweet
and warming Astragali Radix (hudng qi) is described in Seek-
ing Accuracy in the Materia Medica as “the first among all of
the qi-tonifying herbs.” Entirely yang in nature, it powerfully
stimulates the qi dynamic, raises the yang, and disperses the
blood and essences throughout the entire body. Acrid and
strongly warming Cinnamomi Cortex (rdu gui) tonifies the
fire at the gate of vitality to assist the yang. Its warmth enters
the blood to open the vessels and facilitate the movement
of blood, and it stimulates the qi dynamic and transforma-
tion throughout the entire body, as described by Zhang Bin-
Cheng in the early 20th-century work Convenient Reader of
Established Formulas: “The tonifying properties of all herbs
that receive the power of its warming nourishment are greatly
increased. Therefore, their efficacy is also greatly increased.
Not only yang deficiency, but also yin deficiency can be
warmed, because without the yang, the yin cannot be gener-
ated.” Overall, therefore, this formula can be said to stimulate,
tonify, and gather the power of qi and yang in order to stimu-
late the production and transformation of blood.

Cautions and Contraindications

This is a strong tonifying formula. It must not be used for
treating disorders of excess reflected in such symptoms as a
thick tongue coating or a strong and forceful pulse.

Commentary

This is a very commonly used formula for qi and blood de-
ficiency with a predominance of deficient qi tending toward
cold. Regarding its action, the Qing-dynasty physician Wang
Zi-Jie in Selected Annotations to Ancient Formulas from the
Garden of Crimson Snow provides an analysis of the formula
that extends beyond simple qi and blood tonification and
that provides an alternative interpretation of its name:

Adding Astragali Radix (hudng qf) and Cinnamomi Cortex
(rou gui) to Four-Gentlemen Decoction (si jin zi tang) and
Four-Substance Decoction (si wii tang) produces a complex
strategy of hardening and softening. The Spleen is a soft organ,
which is controlled by the hardening herbs in Four-Gentlemen
Decoction (si jiin zi tang). Concerned that excessive hardening
may harm its softness, one adds Astragali Radix (hudng qi) to
support the softening qi. The Liver is a hard organ, which is
controlled by the softening herbs in Four-Substance Decaction
(si wit tang). Concerned that excessive softening may harm its
hardness, one adds Cinnamomi Cortex (rou gu}) in order to
shield its hardness. Attentive to every detail, this [new formula]
can truly be referred to as all-inclusive. For only the tonification
of Liver and Spleen can be called ‘great; as explained in Chapter
29 of Basic Questions 29: The Spleen normally contacts the
Stomach and is the essence or earth. Modeling itself on heaven
and earth, the earth produces the myriad things. Thus, it is

the root of the postnatal life. Although the Liver is a male yin
organ that occupies an inferior position, one has neverthe-

less to worry about its ability of using its excess to exploit any
deficiency. Hence, one must include a strategy whereby harden-

ing and softening [herbs] mutually control each other in any
[formula] that augments and tonifies. Harmonizing the Liver
and constructing the Spleen, [this formula restores] the unceas-
ing transformative [processes] of the middle palace, establish-
ing it like heaven and earth as a place for the production of the
myriad things. Therefore, it is called ‘all-inclusive tonification.

In contemporary practice, this formula is often used pallia-
tively in the treatment of severe chronic and incurable disor-
ders like cancer. It is also used to assist in the recovery from
surgery, severe blood loss, or major illness. Some physicians
advise to take it for up to two weeks before surgery to mini-
mize the risk of complications and provide a basis for healing
and recovery. Similarly, it is used to minimize the side effects
of radiation therapy or chemotherapy, when it is also often
prescribed up to a week before biomedical treatment begins.

Due to its composition, many physicians view this for-
mula to be a variation of Eight-Treasure Decoction (ba zhen
tang), discussed above. However, the text in which this for-
mula was first listed was published in 1180, which is 146 years
before the text in which Eight-Treasure Decoction (ba zhen
tang) is discussed for the first time. Furthermore, a formula
called Internally Tonifying Decoction with Astragalus (nei
bu: hudng qf tang), whose composition is very similar to that
of All-Inclusive Great Tonifying Decoction (shi qudn da bi
tang), can be found in Formulas Bequeathed by the Unortho-
dox Genius Liu Juan-Zi, published in 499. Given the influ-
ence of this formulary, Internally Tonifying Decoction with
Astragalus (nei bit hudng qi tang), listed under ASSOCIATED
FORMULAS below, must thus be considered the true ancestor
of the present formula.

Comparisons
> Vs. ErGHT-TREASURE Decoction (ba zhen tang)

Both fomulas tonify the qi and blood and are derived from
the combination of Four-Gentlemen Decoction (si jin zi
tang) and Four-Substance Decoction (si wi tang). Although
quite similar in composition, the present formula focuses
more strongly on warming the yang and moving the qi and
blood. It is thus preferred for patterns that include symptoms
like cold extremities or weakness in the lower body. Eight-
Treasure Decoction (ba zhen tang), on the other hand, can be
used for patterns characterized by periodic chills and fevers.

ders including various forms of anemia, nervous exhaustion,
chronic urticaria, nonhealing ulcers, to improve postopera-
tive recovery, and as adjunctive treatment to chemotherapy
and radiation therapy.

is the formula from which All-Inclusive Great Tonifying Decoction
(shi quen da bu tang) was derived. The pattern treated by this for-
mula shows few signs of Spleen deficiency, but some yin deficiency.
Hence, it uses Ophiopogonis Radix (mai men dong) instead of Atrac-
tylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bdi zhi). It also uses Polygalae Ra-
dix (yudn zhi) to move the qi and settle the Heart and thereby treat
the pain. In clinical practice, this formula is used more commonly in
external medicine, whereas All-Inclusive Great Tonifying Decoction
(shi qudn da bu tang) is used more commonly in internal medicine
and gynecology.
