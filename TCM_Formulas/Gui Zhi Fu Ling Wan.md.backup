## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
Classic formula that balances warming yang qi (Gui Zhi, Fu Ling) with cooling blood-moving herbs (Mu Dan Pi, Chi Shao, Tao Ren). Particularly effective for conditions where cold constitution leads to blood stasis. The gentle nature makes it suitable for long-term use in chronic gynecological conditions.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows hormone-regulating, anti-inflammatory, and circulation-improving effects. Gui Zhi improves microcirculation while Fu Ling reduces inflammation. Blood-moving herbs help dissolve fibrotic tissue and improve pelvic circulation. Studies demonstrate efficacy in uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and chronic pelvic conditions.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for women with chronic gynecological conditions who have cold constitution. Particularly effective for uterine fibroids and ovarian cysts in women who feel cold and have poor circulation. Often used long-term with good safety profile. Best results when combined with lifestyle modifications.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Traditionally taken as pills, or decoct above doses twice daily
**Preparation**: Can be made into pills or taken as decoction/granules
**Timing**: Between meals, can adjust timing around menstrual cycle
**Duration**: 3-6 months minimum for chronic conditions, often longer
