### Traditional Understanding
"Da Cheng Qi" means "Major Order the Qi" - referring to its powerful ability to restore proper qi movement in severe intestinal blockage. Classic emergency formula for yang ming fu syndrome where heat and matter combine to create serious obstruction. The combination breaks stagnation while purging accumulated heat and waste.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows strong laxative, anti-inflammatory, and choleretic effects. Da Huang contains anthraquinones that stimulate intestinal motility. Mang Xiao provides osmotic laxative action. Studies demonstrate efficacy in severe constipation, intestinal obstruction, and gallbladder inflammation.

### Clinical Experience
EMERGENCY formula that should only be used in severe conditions with clear yang ming fu pattern. Extremely effective for severe constipation with systemic symptoms. Must be used with caution and proper diagnosis. Often reserved for hospital settings or acute emergency situations.

### Dosage & Administration
**Emergency Dose**: Decoct above doses, take once and monitor response
**Preparation**: Cook Da Huang last (5 minutes), dissolve Mang Xiao in warm decoction
**Timing**: Usually given once, can repeat in 6-12 hours if no response
**Duration**: Single dose or very short-term use only
