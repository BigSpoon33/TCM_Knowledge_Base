Formulas that Harmonize Lesser Yang-Warp Disorders 115

Over the centuries, the scope of this formula has been
greatly expanded because of a realization that it can be ef-
fectively used in treating any disorder due to fright or to
phlegm in the Liver-Gallbladder system. At present, it is used
for a wide variety of internally-generated disorders that do
not result from an acute, externally-contracted disease. In
contemporary China, it is widely used in the treatment of
epilepsy. The famous contemporary physician Zhao Xi-Wu
recommends it for treating attacks of irregular heartbeat that
occur at rest, reserving Prepared Licorice Decoction (zhi gan
cdo tang) for the treatment of attacks brought on by activity.
In both China and Japan, it is widely used to treat psychoso-
matic disorders in patients with a strong constitution, often
instead of, or in combination with, biomedical tranquilizers.
According to Wang Qi in Explanation of the Discussion of
Cold Damage, “both within China and abroad, [this formula]
is widely used to treat epilepsy, hypertension, hyperthyroid-
ism, dizziness, alopecia, insomnia, and Meniere’s disease.”

When the severe aspects of this condition have been re-
solved, it is best to continue treatment with formulas such
as Licorice, Wheat, and Jujube Decoction (gan mai da zeo

tang).

Comparisons
> Vs. OTHER BUPLEURUM-BASED FORMULAS

This formula is similar to other harmonizing formulas that
utilize Bupleuri Radix (chdi hui) as the chief ingredient, where
distention of the chest and flanks and a bitter taste consti-
tute key points in the diagnosis. Like these formulas, it can
be used to treat disorders characterized by lesser yang-type
symptoms such as headache, tinnitus, or constraint, and for
conditions characterized by loss of normal cognitive func-
tions involving speech, memory, concentration, or sensation.
However, compared to formulas such as Minor and Major
Bupleurum Decoction (xido da chdi hu tang), Bupleurum
and Cinnamon Twig Decoction (chdi hu gui zhi tang), or
Bupleurum, Cinnamon Twig, and Ginger Decoction (chdi hu
gui jidng tang), these symptoms will typically be much more
pronounced where this formula is indicated.

> Vs. CINNAMON Twic DECOCTION PLUS DRAGON BONE
AND OYSTER SHELL (gui zhi jid long gu mu li tang)

Both formulas treat disorders characterized by such key
symptoms as insomnia, fright palpitations, and heightened
sensitivity to external stimuli. However, Cinnamon Twig De-
coction plus Dragon Bone and Oyster Shell (gui zhi jia leng
gu mi lt tang), discussed in Chapter 9, is indicated for pat-
terns characterized by deficiency cold and loss of essence
characterized by such symptoms as excessive sweating, palpi-
tations, and tension in the lower abdomen. This formula, by

contrast, treats patterns characterized by excess heat and fluid
retention with such symptoms such as restlessness, irritabil-
ity, and impaired consciousness.
