## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
"Tong Qiao Huo Xue" means "open orifices and invigorate blood" - specifically addressing blood stasis that blocks the head orifices and channels. She Xiang (musk) is the key herb that opens orifices and guides the blood-moving herbs to the head region. Classic formula for head trauma and chronic neurological problems from blood stasis.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows neuroprotective, circulation-improving, and anti-inflammatory effects. Blood-moving herbs improve cerebral circulation and reduce inflammation. She Xiang contains compounds that enhance cerebral blood flow and neuroplasticity. Studies demonstrate benefits in traumatic brain injury, stroke recovery, and cognitive impairment.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for chronic neurological problems from head trauma or vascular insufficiency. Particularly effective for post-concussion syndrome and chronic headaches with clear trauma history. Often provides gradual improvement over 2-3 months. Best results when combined with rehabilitation therapy and cognitive exercises.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: She Xiang taken separately as powder or added to strained decoction
**Timing**: Between meals, can increase frequency for acute conditions
**Duration**: 3-6 months for chronic conditions, longer for traumatic brain injury
