Classic approach for people with weak constitution who are susceptible to external pathogens. Balances exterior release with interior support.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows immune-modulating, adaptogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Ren Shen contains ginsenosides that enhance immune function and stress resistance. Wind-dispersing herbs provide antimicrobial and circulation-improving effects. Studies demonstrate benefits in recurrent infections, chronic fatigue, and immune dysfunction.

Particularly effective for chronic fatigue patients who are sensitive to weather changes and environmental factors. Often used preventively during cold season or periods of high stress. Best results with lifestyle modifications to support overall health.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, can be taken as powder
**Timing**: Between meals, can increase frequency during acute illness
**Duration**: 2-6 weeks for acute conditions, 3-6 months for constitutional support
