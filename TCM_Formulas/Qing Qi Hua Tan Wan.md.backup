## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
Classic formula for "phlegm-fire harassing the heart" patterns where heat-phlegm clouds the spirit and causes mental-emotional symptoms. Essential concept: phlegm and heat combine to obstruct clear thinking and emotional stability. The formula clears heat, transforms phlegm, and calms the spirit simultaneously.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows anxiolytic, neuroprotective, and cognitive-enhancing effects. Huang Lian and Huang Qin provide anti-inflammatory compounds that may benefit brain function. Chen Pi and Ban Xia help regulate neurotransmitters. Studies demonstrate benefits in anxiety disorders, cognitive dysfunction, and respiratory conditions with psychological components.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for people with both respiratory/digestive phlegm symptoms and mental-emotional disturbance. Particularly effective for anxiety with physical symptoms like chest tightness and nausea. Often used in psychiatric conditions as adjunct therapy. Best results when combined with stress reduction techniques.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Traditionally taken as pills, or decoct above doses twice daily
**Preparation**: Pills preferred for convenience, decoction for acute symptoms
**Timing**: Between meals, evening dose may help with sleep
**Duration**: 2-8 weeks for mental symptoms, adjust based on response
