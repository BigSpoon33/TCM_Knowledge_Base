The source text advises to grind the herbs into a coarse powder and
take as a draft three times a day. At present, however, it is prepared as
a decoction with a proportionate reduction in dosage. Scatters wind,

pathogen wind disease (2&2 wen feng zhi bing) characterized
by sweating, a sensation of heaviness in the body, wheezing, a sullen
demeanor, no desire to sleep, and a floating pulse at both the proxi-
mal and distal positions. This formula is stronger than the principal
formula and is indicated for a pattern of excess where the pathogen
has invaded both the qi and blood. For Sun Si-Miao, the author of
this formula, a warm pathogen disease was caused by a cold patho-
gen that invaded the body in winter and then lurked in the interior
until the spring, when the raising yang qi would become sufficiently
strong to engage it in battle and cause an acute illness. It was widely
assumed that patients whose yin essence was depleted were particu-
larly prone to this type of disease. For treatment, Sun composed a
formula that dispersed cold from the exterior as well as the blood,
cleared heat from excess, and augmented the fluids.

Because the formula contains many acrid, warm herbs, later phy-
sicians felt that it was inappropriate for treating true warm pathogen
disorders. In Developing the Meaning of Prescriptions Worth a Thou-
sand, the late-Ming dynasty scholar-physician Zhang Lu thus made
the following recommendations:

For [treating cases] with severe fever that has damaged the flu-
ids or with thirst in spite of a mild fever, it does no harm to re-
move Ephedrae Herba (md hudng) and Semen Pruni Armenia-
cae (xing ren) and replace them with Allii fistulosi Bulbus (cdng
bdi) and Sojae Semen praeparatum (dan dou chi) in order to
unblock constraint of the yang, and Trichosanthis Radix (tian
hud fen) in order to enrich the fluids. [In cases] with wheez-
ing and rising qi, Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chudan xieng) and
Angelicae pubescentis Radix (dui hud) should also not be used
lightly. Deficient [patients] cannot overcome cold [damage,
and using] Gypsum fibrosum (shi gdo) makes it [even more]
unlikely that this can be carried out. It should be replaced with
Lophatheri Herba (dan zhii ye) to clear the Heart and Poria

(fui ling) to secure the middle [burner] in order to provide for
tonification. In this manner, one supplies something that was
not yet attained [by Sun Si-Miao] in Important Formulas Worth
a Thousand Gold Pieces.

It was this suggestion that was later picked up by Yu Gen-Chu
and further developed into Modified Solomon's Seal Decoc-
tion (jid jidn wei rui tang).
