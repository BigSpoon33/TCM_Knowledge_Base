## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
"Wu Mei Wan" represents the classic approach to "cold above, heat below" patterns complicated by parasites. Wu Mei (black plum) calms roundworms while the complex herb combination addresses the underlying cold-heat complex. The formula treats both the parasites and the constitutional imbalance that allows them to flourish.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and digestive-regulating effects. Wu Mei contains organic acids with antiparasitic properties. The warming herbs improve digestive function while clearing herbs prevent excessive heat accumulation. Studies demonstrate benefits in functional GI disorders and chronic digestive conditions.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for complex digestive disorders with mixed cold-heat symptoms. Particularly effective for IBS and chronic gastritis with alternating symptoms. Often requires 6-12 weeks for full benefit. Best results when combined with dietary modifications and stress reduction. Modern use focuses more on functional disorders than actual parasites.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Usually taken as pills, 6-9g twice daily
**Preparation**: Traditionally made into honey pills, modern granules available
**Timing**: Between meals, can adjust timing based on symptoms
**Duration**: 6-12 weeks for chronic digestive disorders, shorter for acute parasitic infections
