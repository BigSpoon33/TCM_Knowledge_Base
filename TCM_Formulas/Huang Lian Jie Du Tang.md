## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
"Four Yellows" formula representing the ultimate heat-clearing and detoxifying combination. Each herb targets specific organs: Huang Lian (heart), Huang Qin (lung), Huang Bai (kidney), Zhi Zi (liver). Together they clear heat from all three jiao.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows powerful antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective effects. Contains berberine (Huang Lian), baicalein (Huang Qin), and other alkaloids with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Studies show efficacy against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

### Clinical Experience
Extremely effective for acute infections with high fever and toxicity. Often dramatic results in 24-48 hours. Must monitor for overcooling and damage to yang qi. Best used short-term for acute conditions.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, can increase frequency during acute phase
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, don't overcook to preserve active compounds
**Timing**: Every 4-6 hours during acute infection
**Duration**: 3-7 days for acute conditions, stop when heat clears
