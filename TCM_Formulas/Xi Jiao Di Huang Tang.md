Formulas that Simultaneously Clear Heat from the Qi and Blood Levels 179

The source text says to take equal amounts of the ingredients; the
dosages listed above reflect those in most contemporary texts. Clears
heat, drains the Lungs, eliminates phlegm, and regulates the qi. For
accumulation of heat in the Lungs that manifests as wheezing, dis-
tention, and fullness in the chest and diaphragm with copious sticky
phlegm and inhibited stools.

Heat in the diaphragm and chest ascends to scorch the fluids and
gives rise to phlegm-heat in the Lungs. Heat that descends into the
region below the diaphragm can damage the yin and fluids there
and result in heat accumulation in the Stomach and Intestines in the
form of inhibited stools. This formula treats excess phlegm-heat ac-
cumulation in the chest and diaphragm. Because there is an inherent
danger of damaging the normal qi when treating an excess pathogen,
Ginseng Radix (ren shen) is added to mitigate the damage caused by
the pathogen itself and that brought about by the acrid and bitter
herbs used to drain the Lungs. It also includes the moistening herbs
Armeniacae Semen (xing ren) and Mori Cortex (sang bdi pi) to pre-
vent damage to the Lung yin and fluids by the heat pathogen and the
formula’s bitter, drying herbs.

This somewhat balanced approach allows what would otherwise
be a severe formula to be given to patients whose state of qi and flu-
ids might not tolerate a less conservative method. Nonetheless, for
children, the elderly, and those with weak qi, one should reduce or
eliminate Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) and Natrii Sulfas (mang
xido). If constipation is a factor for these patients, substituting a large
dose of Trichosanthis Fructus (gud Idu) for the harsh draining herbs
may also be useful.The pattern treated by Ginseng Decoction to
Drain the Lungs (ren shen xie fei tang) is one that often results from a
wind-cold or wind-heat pathogen that sinks into the Lungs and dia-
phragm and transforms to phlegm-heat accumulation. In Western
medicine, this often corresponds to bronchitis, pneumonia, tonsil-
litis, or pulmonary tuberculosis,

FORMULAS THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY
CLEAR HEAT FROM THE QI
AND BLOOD LEVELS

When heat toxin enters the body in the course of an epidemic
disorder, it can flood the entire body and produce patterns in
which heat flares in both the qi and blood levels at the same
time. Clinical manifestations include qi-level symptoms such
as high fever, irritability, and thirst, accompanied by bleeding
from the upper orifices and bleeding into the skin caused by
chaotic movement of the blood, as well as by impaired con-
sciousness and delirious speech due to heat toxin sinking into
the interior. The treatment strategy for such complex disor-
ders is to combine formulas that deal with the individual as-
pects of the pathology into new and larger formulas that can
effectively address these serious and sometimes life-threat-
ening conditions. This requires formulas that combine sub-

stances that clear qi-level heat, such as Gypsum fibrosum (shi
gao) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mii), those that clear
the nutritive and cool the blood, such as Bubali Cornu (shui
niti jido) and Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di hudng), and those
that clear heat and resolve toxicity, such as Coptidis Rhizoma
(hudng lidn) and Scutellariae Radix (hudng qin).

* be adjusted in accordance with whether one chooses a small,

& medium, or large dose of the chief herbs. Physicians should use
the pulse as indicator for determining the appropriate dosage: a
| submerged, thin, and rapid pulse (reflecting a more severe con-
dition) requires a large dose; a floating, large, and rapid pulse
(reflecting a less severe condition) requires a small dose; and a

| pulse in between these two extremes requires a medium dose.

‘ Method of Preparation Cook Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao) and
Bubali Cornu (shui nit jido) first for 15-20 minutes.

‘ Actions Clears heat, resolves toxicity, cools the blood, and
& drains fire

Indications

Intense fever, strong thirst, dry heaves, severe and stabbing
headache, extreme irritability, and in severe cases, delirious
speech, rashes, and nosebleed. The tongue is dark red, the
lips are dark and scorched, and the pulse is either rapid, sub-
merged, and thin or rapid, floating, and large.


180 Chapter 4 / Formulas that Clear Heat

This is an epidemic toxin warm pathogen disorder that
manifests with severe fire in the qi and blood levels. Intense
fever and strong thirst are signs of vigorous heat in the qi lev-
el. Severe, stabbing headache is due to fire toxin rising to the
head. When fire enters the blood level, it disturbs the Heart
and Liver, which causes extreme irritability; in severe cases,
it causes incoherent or delirious speech. Fire at this level also
incites the reckless movement of blood, which manifests in
rashes, vomiting of blood, or nosebleed. A dark-red tongue
with dark, scorched lips are signs of intense fire toxin in the qi
and blood levels.

A submerged, thin, and rapid pulse occurs when intense
fire toxin constrains the pulse. A submerged and rapid pulse
that is not thin indicates that the fire toxin is less strong and
the constraint less severe. A floating, large, and rapid pulse is
a sign that there is no constraint at all and that the fire toxin
is only light and superficial. If the fire toxin is not relieved, the
pulse will become thin.

Analysis of Formula

This is a combination of three formulas discussed in earlier
sections of this chapter, plus some additions. They are White
Tiger Decoction (bdi hui tang), Rhinoceros Horn and Rehm-
annia Decoction (xi jido di huang tang), and Coptis Decoc-
tion to Resolve Toxicity (hudng lidn jie du tang). Among
these, the functions of White Tiger Decoction (bdi hu tang)
and its chief herb Gypsum fibrosum (shi gdo) are most im-
portant. Yu Lin, the formula’s author, explains: “This is a very
cold formula [intended] for resolving toxicity. Therefore, it
uses a large dose of Gypsum fibrosum (shi gdo). By first calm-
ing the most extreme [manifestations of the disorder], that is,
clearing the fire from all twelve channels, everything else will
quiet down by itself”

In terms of individual ingredients, one group, composed
of Gypsum fibrosum (shi gdo), Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi
miu), Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo), and Lophatheri Herba
(dan zhu ye), clears heat from the qi level. Another group,
Bubali Cornu (shui niti jido), Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di
hudng), Moutan Cortex (mt dan pi), Paeoniae Radix ru-
bra (chi shdo), and Scrophulariae Radix (xudn shen), clears
heat from the blood level. A third group, Coptidis Rhizoma
(hudng lidn), Scutellariae Radix (hudng qin), and Gardeniae
Fructus (zhi zi), opens the Triple Burner by draining heat
and toxic fire. Forsythiae Fructus (lidn giao), when combined
with Scrophulariae Radix (xudn shen), resolves toxicity and
disperses fire roaming throughout the body. Platycodi Radix
(jie geng) and Lophatheri Herba (dan zhii ye) have an ascend-
ing action that conducts the actions of the other ingredients
upward.

Cautions and Contraindications

Contraindicated in cases with yang deficiency or weakness of
the Spleen and Stomach.

Commentary

Yu Lin’s analysis and treatment of ‘heat epidemics’ (447% re
yi) is highly original and based on a meticulous differentia-
tion of their signs and symptoms, particularly of maculae and
papules. He defined heat epidemic disorders primarily on the
basis of rashes: “Black heat epidemic [disorders] are not cold
damage disorders. Cold damage disorders do not manifest
with maculae and papules.” He also listed four symptoms that
are shared by both disorders and that might lead to a misdi-
agnosis: headache, sweating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Unlike
headaches due to lesser yang or yang brightness disorders,
heat epidemic headaches are severe, stabbing, and feel as if
the head is split. The head feels heavy and cannot be lifted.
Unlike yang brightness channel disorders where sweating oc-
curs over the entire body, sweating in heat epidemic disorders
is limited to the head and upper body. The vomiting of heat
epidemic disorders is not accompanied by flank pain or dis-
comfort, as it would be in lesser yang disorders. Diarrhea is
not accompanied by abdominal fullness, as in lesser yin dis-
orders, but is characterized, instead, by constant evacuations
that have a foul smell.

A special case is that of the ‘stifled epidemic’ (FU 7% men
yi) disorder. This is a sudden, strong invasion of a turbid heat
toxin that completely obstructs the qi dynamic in the interior
such that exterior manifestations resemble those of abandon-
ment of yang: a very pale complexion, icy-cold extremities,
and cold sweats with big drops of fluid. The presence of heat
in the interior is betrayed, however, by impaired conscious-
ness, gripping abdominal pain, an unrelieved desire to vomit
or defecate, splitting headache, and shaking of the head, all of
which are due to heat toxins bottling-up the yang qi in the in-
terior and the battle between the true and the pathogenic qi.

Dosage of Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao)

Yu Lin stated that Gypsum fibrosum (shi gdo) alone is in-
sufficient to treat such disorders. At the same time, it is the
only substance capable of clearing heat from everywhere
within the body. If qi-level heat is cleared, it is much easier
to treat heat at other levels. Due to the strong nature of the
heat pathogen, Yu advocated the use of a very large dosage
of Gypsum fibrosum (shtf gao). This has caused much con-
troversy among later physicians. The Qing-dynasty physician
Zhuang Zhi-Ting, cited in Warp and Woof of Warm-Heat
Pathogen Diseases, argued that a dosage of 15-90g was suffi-
cient. The modern physician Jiao Shu-De, however, contends
that doses of as much as 150-180g are frequently necessary.
Wang Shi-Xiong, Yu Lin’s great admirer, argued that there was
no single, one-size-fits-all dosage, but that it was the nature of
the particular disorder that determined the extent of medical
intervention. Severe heat requires a severe response, and thus
there was nothing wrong with Yu Lin’s advocacy of using a
very large dosage of heat-clearing herbs.

«| qi- or blood-level symptoms.

Actions Clears qi-level heat and cools the blood

Indications

For warm pathogen heat disorders with heat entering the qi
and blood levels. Heat sinking into the blood level causes fe-
ver that worsens at night, a dark-red macular rash, and a rap-
id pulse. However, the qi-level signs and symptoms, like thirst
and a yellow tongue coating, do not subside, which indicates
that the yang brightness qi level heat remains strong. This
implies a very strong pathogen and a strong constitution.

Analysis of Formula

This formula can be regarded as a variation of White Tiger
Decoction (bdi ht tang). The chief herb is Gypsum fibrosum
(shi gao), which clears the intense heat in the qi level that is
the root cause of this presentation. Bubali Cornu (shui nit
jido) and Scrophulariae Radix (xudn shen) are the deputies.
They resolve toxicity and clear heat in the blood, and nour-
ish the yin fluids, thereby helping to vent the pathogen back
to the qi level. Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mii) serves as
an assistant to drain qi-level heat. Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan
cteo) and Nonglutinous rice (jing mi) supplement the middle
burner qi and harmonize the actions of the other ingredi-
ents.

Cautions and Contraindications

Contraindicated in cases with yang deficiency or weakness of
the Spleen and Stomach.

Commentary

This formula is primarily used to treat macular rashes that
result from heat in the qi and blood levels. Many physicians
advise to add herbs that invigorate the blood and transform
stasis, such as Moutan Cortex (mu dan pi), Paeoniae Radix
rubra (chi shdo), and Radix Rehmanniae Glutinosae (sheng
di hudng), to increase its effectiveness. This is because blood-
level heat readily leads to blood stasis, which engenders more
heat and, in a vicious cycle, causes more bleeding. In addi-
tion, the cold nature of this formula itself can easily cause the
blood to congeal and stagnate.

A total of nineteen different formulas named Transform
Maculae Decoction (hud ban tang) are listed in the Encyclo-
pedia of Chinese Medical Formulas, Although they all address
the same symptom, their individual constituents are quite
different. A comparison of their composition and specific in-
dications nevertheless allows us to make some useful gener-
alizations regarding the treatment of maculopapular rashes
with Chinese medicine. In terms of the disease dynamic ad-
dressed by these formulas, one can distinguish three main
scenarios: (1) wind-heat constraining the flow of yang qi in
the exterior such that the Lungs lose their ability to dissemi-
nate and direct downward, which in turn causes heat toxin to
accumulate in the exterior from which it fails to be vented to


182 Chapter 4 / Formulas that Clear Heat

the outside; (2) the more serious case of heat toxin sinking
into the qi and blood levels in the course of a warm pathogen
disorder, discussed above; and (3) late-stage rashes associ-
ated with a deficient pulse, which indicates qi and yin defi-
ciency and the inability of the body to completely eliminate
the pathogenic qi.

In terms of formula composition, one can also distinguish
three main groups: (1) formulas that focus on venting patho-
genic heat constraint from the skin and muscle layer with
herbs like Arctii Fructus (niti bang zi), Forsythiae Fructus
(lidn qido), Bupleuri Radix (chdi hu), Cimicifugae Rhizoma
(sheng md), Schizonepetae Herba (jing jie), Saposhnikoviae
Radix (fang feng), and Scutellariae Radix (hudng gin); (2) for-
mulas that focus on clearing heat and resolving toxicity from
the qi and blood levels with herbs like Gypsum fibrosum (shi
gao), Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mii), Scrophulariae Ra-
dix (xudn shen), Bubali Cornu (shui nit jido), Moutan Cor-
tex (mt dain pt), and Radix Rehmanniae Glutinosae (sheng
di hudng); (3) formulas that treat late-stage rashes by com-
bining herbs that augment the qi and nourish the yin, such
as Ginseng Radix (ren shen), Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo),
and Scrophulariae Radix (xudn shen), with those that clear
heat, such as Gypsum fibrosum (shi geo) and Anemarrhenae
Rhizoma (zhi mii). Besides their relevance for treating warm
pathogen disorders, these principles have important implica-
tions for the treatment of skin diseases in everyday clinical
practice.

Comparisons

> Vs. CLEAR EPIDEMICS AND OVERCOME TOXICITYDRINK
(ging wen bai dui yin) AND MAGICAL RHINOCEROS
SPECIAL PILL (shen xi dan)

All these formulas clear heat and resolve toxicity from both
the qi and blood levels. They all are used in the treatment
of macular and papular rashes. Clear Epidemics and Over-
come Toxicity Drink (qing wen bai du yin) focuses first on
clearing heat from the yang brightness with a large dose of
Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao) as the chief substance. This is
indicated where heat toxins flood the entire body or become
constrained in the interior with symptoms of yang deser-
tion on the outside. Magical Rhinoceros Special Pill (shen xi
dan) uses the combination of Bubali Cornu (shut nit jido)
and Acori tatarinowii Rhizoma (shi chang pi) as chief herbs
in order to clear heat from the Heart and open the orifices.
Only secondarily does it focus on macular rashes. Transform
Maculae Decoction (hua ban tang) combines Gypsum fibro-
sum (shi geo), Scrophulariae Radix (xudn shen), and Bubali
Cornu (shui nit jido) to focus equally on clearing heat from
the qi and blood levels. Its main focus is on treating maculae
that result from heat in the yang brightness and blood levels,
rather than on relieving toxic heat constraint.

FORMULAS THAT CLEAR
HEAT FROM THE ORGANS

When heat excess develops in an organ, it will manifest in
signs and symptoms that are characteristic of the pathology
of that organ and its associated channel. While this type of
disorder often occurs in the broader context of an externally-
contracted disease, it is said to be at the organ level because
its manifestations are clearly those of a particular organ. Just
as often, however, these disorders can arise from internal
causes. In treating such disorders, the choice of formula is
based upon the organ affected, and the extent of its involve-
ment.

* Heat or fire in the Lungs is primarily treated by herbs that
clear the Lungs and drain out heat, such as Mori Cortex
(sang bdi pt) and Scutellariae Radix (hudng qin). Lung heat
can be very closely related to qi-level heat, and when this
occurs, qi-level herbs that clear heat and resolve toxicity,
such as Lonicerae Flos (jin yin hud) and Forsythiae Fructus
(lidn giao), may be utilized. If there is lurking fire, herbs
