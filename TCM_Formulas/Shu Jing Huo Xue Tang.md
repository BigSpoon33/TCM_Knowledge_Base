### Traditional Understanding
"Shu Jing Huo Xue" means "dredge channels and invigorate blood" - addressing blockages in the channel and collateral system. Comprehensive formula that combines blood nourishment with blood movement and qi regulation. Essential for chronic pain conditions where blood stasis combines with qi stagnation to block normal circulation.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and circulation-improving effects. Blood-nourishing herbs support tissue repair while blood-moving herbs improve microcirculation. Qi-regulating herbs help restore normal nerve and vascular function. Studies demonstrate benefits in arthritis, chronic pain, and circulation disorders.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for chronic musculoskeletal pain with clear stasis signs. Particularly effective for people with long-standing injuries or arthritis that has developed blood stasis patterns. Often used for rehabilitation after stroke or injury. Best results when combined with physical therapy and lifestyle modifications.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 9-12g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, can be concentrated for convenience
**Timing**: Between meals, can increase frequency during pain flares
**Duration**: 6-12 weeks for chronic conditions, often used cyclically
