Formulas that Dispel Wind-Dampness 757

Analysis of Formula

This formula treats invasion by wind-cold-dampness (wind-
dampness being predominant) due to deficiency of the pro-
tective and nutritive qi. For this reason, it focuses on expelling
the wind and dispelling the dampness while also augmenting
the qi and harmonizing the nutritive and protective qi. Be-
cause the focus is on eliminating wind and dispelling damp-
ness to treat pain and stiffness, the chief herbs are Notop-
terygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qiang hud) and Saposhnikoviae
Radix (fang feng). Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qiang
hud) is specific for dispelling wind-dampness from the upper
body. Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng) opens the yang and
dispels dampness without being too drying. Angelicae sinen-
sis Radix (dang gui) and Paeoniae Radix (shdo yao) serve as
deputies to nourish the blood and harmonize the nutritive qi,
thereby facilitating the dispelling of the pathogenic qi. They
also prevent the acrid and drying nature of the chief herbs
from damaging the blood. Astragali Radix (hudng qf) is the
third deputy, augmenting the qi and firming up the protective
qi. In combination with Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng), it
dispels wind-dampness, while in combination with Angelicae
sinensis Radix (dang gui) and Paeoniae Radix (shdo yao), it
harmonizes the nutritive and protective qi.

Curcumae longae Rhizoma (jidng hudng) acts as assistant
in invigorating the blood and moving the qi. It is specific for
spasms and pain in the shoulders and upper arms. Together
with Paeoniae Radix (shdo yao) and Angelicae sinensis Radix
(dang gui), it helps regulate the blood in accordance with
the adage that, “To treat wind, one must first treat the blood,
[because] when the blood moves, the wind is naturally extin-
guished.” Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo) augments the qi and,
as envoy, harmonizes the functions of the other herbs. Ju-
jubae Fructus (da zdo) and Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng
jidng), which are added when preparing the draft, harmonize
the nutritive and protective qi, enhancing the formula’s ability
to dispel wind and dampness.

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula is warming and tonifying. It is not indicated for
patterns of wind-damp-heat painful obstruction.

Commentary

This formula was first listed in the Song-dynasty formulary
Yang Family Formulas. Several later physicians used it as a
blueprint to compose similar formulas published under the
same name. Its strategy of tonifying the qi and blood at the
same time as dispelling wind-dampness was equally influ-
ential. Thus, Wang Zi-Jie referred to it as “the ancestor of
[formulas] for treating painful obstruction.” In Discussion of
Medical Formulas, the late-Qing-dynasty physician Fei Bo-
Xiong penned a similar eulogy:

If the nutritive and protective qi are not exhausted, from where
might wind enter? Those who do not regulate the nutritive

and protective qi and [rely on the] excessive use of wind herbs
either raise phlegm up
