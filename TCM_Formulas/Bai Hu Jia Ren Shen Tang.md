FORMULAS THAT CLEAR HEAT
AND RESOLVE TOXICITY

The formulas in this section are used in treating heat toxin
with vigorous heat in the three burners characterized by fe-
ver, irritability, incoherent speech, nausea or vomiting, nose-
bleed, rashes, or various types of sores. Toxin is generally
distinguished from heat by the presence of pustular lesions
such as sores, or by the general ‘sickness’ of the patient. These
formulas focus on heat toxin in the middle and upper burn-
ers, which may develop from constrained pathogenic influ-
ences generating heat, the accumulation of heat in the chest
and diaphragm, or wind-heat epidemic toxin attacking the
head or face. In addition, formulas that treat toxic sores char-
acterized by localized redness, swelling, pain, and malaise are
included.

The word ‘toxin’ (# di) can mean different things de-
pending on the context. It may refer to the cause of a disease,
the pathological mechanism of a disease, or the toxicity of a
substance, and is sometimes used interchangeably with the
term for ‘pathogenic influence‘ (4% xie). In this chapter, toxin
refers to the etiology or clinical presentation, not the toxicity
of a substance. Chinese medicine also differentiates between
yin and yang toxins, a distinction that dates back to Chapter
3 of Essentials from the Golden Cabinet. In general, yin toxin
refers to toxicity accompanied by signs of cold, such as a pale
or white complexion, white pus, or fatigue. Yang toxin refers
to toxicity that manifests purely as heat. The formulas in this
section address yang toxin.

The core ingredients in these formulas are those that clear
heat and resolve toxicity, such as Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng
lidn), Scutellariae Radix (hudng qin), Phellodendri Cortex
(hudng bai), Lonicerae Flos (jin yin hud), Forsythiae Fruc-
tus (lidn giao), Isatidis/Baphicacanthis Radix (ban lan gen),
and Taraxaci Herba (pu gong ying). As heat toxicity is often
constrained and clumped in the upper or superficial parts
of the body, herbs that disperse wind and raise upward are
often added, such as Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bd he),
Arctii Fructus (ni bang zi), Bombyx batryticatus (bdi jidng
cdn), and Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng). When heat toxic-
ity clumps in the middle burner, it can lead to constipation.
Medicinals such as Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) and
Natrii Sulfas (mang xido) are then used to drain out heat and
unblock the bowels. Heat toxicity can clog up and collect,
leading to local swelling and firmness, such as abscesses or
boils. To treat these conditions, it is helpful to include herbs
that transform phlegm and disperse clumping, such as Fritil-
lariae Bulbus (bei mii), Citri reticulatae Pericarpium (chen
pt), and Bombyx batryticatus (bdi jidng cdn). These abscesses
and other swellings can be extremely painful. Herbs that in-
vigorate the blood and stop pain will then be necessary, such
as Angelicae sinensis radicis Cauda (dang gui wei), Olibanum
(rit xiang), and Myrrha (mo yao).

i Actions Drains fire and resolves toxicity


168 Chapter 4 / Formulas that Clear Heat

Indications

High fever, irritability, a dry mouth and throat, incoherent
speech, insomnia, dark urine, a red tongue with a yellow
coating, and a rapid, forceful pulse. Also for nosebleed or
vomiting of blood due to heat excess; carbuncles, deep-root-
ed boils, and other toxic swellings; and dysenteric disorders
or jaundice due to damp-heat.

This is severe obstruction of the three burners by fire
toxin (also known as ‘heat toxin’), which pervades both the
interior and exterior. Toxin can develop when an external
pathogenic influence is transformed by constraint or from
the accumulation of internally-generated heat. The fire toxin
that ensues is present throughout the three burners and dis-
turbs the spirit. This manifests as high fever, irritability, and
in severe cases, incoherent speech and insomnia. The searing
heat injures the fluids and dries the mouth and throat. Severe
heat may also induce reckless movement of blood (especially
in the upper part of the body), which causes nosebleeds or
vomiting of blood. Injury to the blood vessels can result in
leakage to the skin and the formation of purpura or rashes.
Heat obstructing the muscle layer produces carbuncles, boils,
and other types of suppurative swellings. The red tongue with
a yellow coating and the fast, forceful pulse reflect the pres-
ence of fire toxin. In some cases, fire toxin from constraint
may cause damp-heat dysenteric disorders or jaundice.

Analysis of Formula

Effective treatment of this condition requires that the heat (or
fire) is drained from the entire body. Because the Heart cor-
responds to the fire phase, a substance that effectively drains
fire from the Heart can cause an abatement of fire in all the
other organs. Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn), the chief herb
in this formula, does just this. It is also very useful in drain-
ing fire from the middle burner, a region of the body that,
if not attended to, can give rise to many complications. The
deputy, Scutellariae Radix (hudng qin), clears heat from the
upper burner. Phellodendri Cortex (hudng bai), one of the
assistants, clears heat from the lower burner. The other as-
sistant, Gardeniae Fructus (zhi zi), drains heat from the three
burners through the urine. This herb is particularly helpful
in relieving irritability. Once the fire is effectively drained, the
toxin will disappear.

Cautions and Contraindications

Because it is very bitter and cold, this formula should only be
prescribed in cases of excess for patients of robust constitu-
tion. Since it can easily injure the yin, it should not be taken
long term. If prescribed for conditions of heat in the nutritive
or blood levels, it can readily injure the yin.

Commentary

This formula is suitable for all types of fire toxin obstructing

the three burners. Such patterns are typically characterized
by symptoms such as high fever, irritability, a dry mouth and
throat, a red tongue with a yellow coating, and a rapid, strong
pulse. Most commentators agree that the herbs that comprise
the formula have been selected to drain heat and resolve tox-
icity from different sections of the Triple Burner. However, it
is equally possible to think of their combination as a simple
additive synergy where substances with the same basic ac-
tion potentiate their individual effects. This perspective was
first suggested by the Ming dynasty scholar-physician Zhang
Jie-Bin:
There is yin and yang fire, and heat [disorders] can be divided
[according to whether they occur] above or below. According to
the ancient formularies, Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn) clears
the Heart, Scutellariae Radix (hudng qin) clears the Lungs,
Dendrobii Herba (shi hui) and Paeoniae Radix (shdo yao) clear
the Spleen, Gentianae Radix (leng dan cdo) clears the Liver, and
Phellodendri Cortex (hudng bai) clears the Kidneys. Present
usage generally adheres to this method. It is also a method of
sticking [to custom without adapting to changing circum-
stance]. Generally, cold and cooling substances are all able to
drain fire [irrespective of its location]. How could one claim
that they cool here but do not cool there?

The contemporary formula expert Wang Mian-Zhi makes
an interesting point regarding the emphasis on this formula’s
ability to resolve toxicity. He argues that this originally ap-
plied to its use in treating the effects of alcohol abuse. Alcohol
is an acrid, dispersing, and strongly heating substance the
effects of which are felt all over the body, that is, throughout
the entire Triple Burner. In particular, although excess heat
is itself a qi-aspect phenomenon, the effects of alcohol are
focused on the blood. From this perspective, the present for-
mula is particularly suitable for draining qi-aspect heat that
stirs the blood, unlike White Tiger Decoction (bdi hii tang),
which clears yang brightness heat that has spread through-
out the Triple Burner. Furthermore, the aftereffects of alcohol
consumption—insomnia, flushes, irritability, focal disten-
tion—provide useful clinical markers for using the formula
in clinical practice.

Comparisons
> Vs. MAJOR ORDER THE Qi DecocTion (da cheng qi tang)

Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library differentiates the
use of these formulas:

The presence of dry stool in the Stomach causes a patient [to
suffer from] delirious speech. Regular heat exuberance also
causes a patient [to suffer from] delirious speech. In cases of
constipation with delirious speech, it is appropriate to take
Order the Qi Decoction (da cheng qi tang). [If the bowels are]
open, [or even more if there is] dysentery with delirious speech,
it is appropriate to take Four Substance Decoction with Coptis
for Eliminating Heat (si wei hudng lidn chu re tang) [another
name for this formula].


Formulas that Clear Heat and Resolve Toxicity 169

In both cases, heat is located primarily in the yang brightness
system but leads to different manifestations as it develops
according to a different momentum. In the first case, heat
enters into the bowels where it dries up the fluids and causes
interior clumping with constipation. In the second case, it
disperses throughout the three yang channels in the exterior
and the Triple Burner in the interior. This is possible because
the yang brightness is the ‘sea of qi and blood’ and the ‘sea of
the twelve channels. Another perspective, suggested by the
contemporary physician Ding Xue-Ping, is to attribute Order
the Qi Decoction (da cheng qi tang) patterns to dry-heat and
Coptis Decoction to Resolve Toxicity (hudng lidn jie du tang)
patterns to damp-heat.

In clinical practice, yang toxin patterns are sometimes
accompanied by constipation. In these cases, one can follow
the clinical experience of the Qing-dynsaty physician Fei Bo-
Xiong, who advised replacing Scutellariae Radix (hudng qin)
with Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) in order to unblock
the bowels and guide heat downward.
