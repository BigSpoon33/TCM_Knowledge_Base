Formulas that Release Exterior Wind-Cold 23

that promote exiting are combined with sour, astringent herbs
that facilitate holding and entering. Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi
shdo) and Schisandrae Fructus (wii wei zi) thereby contribute
actively to the effect of the formula, rather than merely coun-
teracting the potential side effects of the main herbs.

Key Indicators

In summary, this is one formula that should be considered
for any condition characterized by an excess of water that
cannot be transformed by the body’s yang qi and that, in
turn, constrains the gi dynamic. In clinical practice, this will
most often involve conditions characterized by coughing and
wheezing, although it may extend to other symptoms of wa-
ter excess such as nausea, diarrhea, or edema. However, given
the harsh nature of the formula, it is important to be certain
that its use is, in fact, indicated in a particular case. Paying
attention to the following four indicators will greatly assist in
making the correct diagnosis.

1. Complexion: Cold, thin mucus obstructing the disper-
sion of yang to the exterior is often reflected in some
degree of puffiness, especially around the eyes, but also
the occurrence of dark spots, indicating constraint due
to cold, at the temples, under the eyes, on the cheeks, or
at the neck.

2. Pulse: Textbooks describe the typical pulse accompany-
ing this pattern as wiry (indicating constraint due to
thin mucus), or floating and tight (indicating cold fet-
tering the exterior). In practice, however, the pulse can
also be deep and slow, or frail, at the distal or proximal
positions, indicating that the yang qi cannot penetrate
to the exterior because it is constrained by yin fluids.

3. Tongue: The typical tongue in this pattern will be wet
with a slippery white coating. The tongue body itself
will not be abnormal, unlike patterns marked by damp-
ness due to Kidney or Spleen deficiency.

4. Secretions: Visible mucus in this pattern will be thin,
watery, and bubbly. Sputum expectorated from the
Lungs will resemble egg white in consistency and be
clear and transparent.

Furthermore, once the acute symptoms have abated, it is ad-
visable to switch to a milder formula, like those built around
the combination of Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui zhi) and Poria
(fi ling), in order to promote the transformation of qi and
water.

Comparisons
> Vs. FivE-INGREDIENT POWDER WITH Porta (wii ling sdin)

Both formulas treat accumulation of water excess in the inte-
rior with cold in the exterior. However, this formula focuses

on the upper burner (chest and Lungs) and is used primarily
for patterns characterized by wheezing. Secondary symptoms
are an absence of sweating and no thirst. Five-Ingredient
Powder with Poria (wii ling sden), on the other hand, focuses
on the lower burner and the Bladder and is used primarily for
patterns characterized by inhibited urination. Both thirst and
sweating are important secondary symptoms.
