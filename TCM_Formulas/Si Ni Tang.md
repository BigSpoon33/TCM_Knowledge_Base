558 Chapter 13 / Formulas that Regulate the Blood

Ideas regarding the nature and treatment of blood stasis
in Chinese medicine have a long history, but some of the
most commonly prescribed formulas are of relatively recent
origin. The Inner Classic, for instance, does not talk about
‘blood stasis’ but discusses problems of blood circulation by
means of a vocabulary that refers to the qualitative degen-
eration of blood as an entity of physiological function, as
much as it does to its movement. Pathological states char-
acterized by noxious blood (% 2 e xue), lingering blood
(@ #2 liv xue), or blood excess (#2 & xue shi) occur when
the relationship between qi and blood is not harmonized;
they can be regulated by means of treatment strategies that
encompass dredging ( jue), reducing (H] xue), dispersing
(# san), and attacking (& gong). Although the Inner Classic
does not directly link these strategies to formulas, one of the
few prescriptions listed in the text—Four [Parts] Sepia and
One [Part] Rubia Pill (29 3k F — 8 do 2. si wil 2ei gai yi lid
ri wdn)—can be regarded as one of the earliest blood-regu-
lating formulas in the history of Chinese medicine. For more
on this, see the COMMENTARY under the entry for Stabilize
Gushing Decoction (git cheng tang), discussed in Chapter 9.

The term ‘static blood’ (#sa ya xue) itself appears for
the first time in Chapter 16 of Essentials from the Golden
Cabinet. Its author, the late-Han-dynasty physician Zhang
Zhong-Jing, composed a number of formulas for its treat-
ment and outlined key diagnostic markers that have proven
their value until the present day. These include dryness of
the mouth with no desire to drink, a subjective sensation of
fullness in the lower abdomen, and dryness and discolor-
ation of the skin. Later physicians added new formulas and
discussed the pathophysiology of blood stasis in more detail,
but it was not until the Qing dynasty that two more radical
innovations redefined the field. The first was the distinction
between stagnation in the channels and collaterals, which
was elaborated by Ye Tian-Shi in the early 18th century. Ye
attributed stagnation in the channels primarily to qi, and
that of stagnation in the collaterals as centered primarily
on blood. He argued that stasis of blood in the collaterals
requires the use of substances that are acrid but not drying,
and suggested that animal medicinals are eminently suitable
for this purpose.

A more radical path of innovation was charted by the
19th-century physician Wang Qing-Ren. Based on ana-
tomical observations, Wang proposed to overhaul the entire
anatomy of the Inner Classic and defined the treatment of
blood stasis as the cornerstone of a medicine based on these
new definitions. Wang’s revolutionary spirit and his focus
on blood, a substance that was more easily aligned to bio-
medical understandings of the body than qi, has contributed
to the enormous popularity of his works in contemporary
China. Readers will find a more detailed analysis of Wang’s
innovation in the COMMENTARY to his flagship formula,

Drive Out Stasis from the Mansion of Blood Decoction (xue
fu zhu yu tang).

Later writers who made significant contributions to the
contemporary treatment of blood pathologies include the
modern physicians Tang Zong-Hai, who wrote a text dedicat-
ed to the treatment of bleeding patterns, and Zhang Xi-Chun,
whose contribution to the understanding of blood stasis and
its treatment was already influenced by Western anatomy and
physiology. In contemporary China, this influence has be-
come ever stronger.

In Chinese medicine, the term ‘blood stasis’ implies
more than blood that has congealed and no longer flows as
it should. It denotes all blood that has become noxious (#
e), that is, blood that impedes physiological functions. Key
signs and symptoms of such stasis include palpable, immo-
bile masses, abscesses and ulcers, loss of hair or brittle hair,
purple lips, dark discoloration of the sclera, purple spots on
the tongue or a darkish tongue, and a choppy, submerged,
tight, or wiry pulse. In practice, however, the use of blood-
invigorating formulas covers a far wider spectrum of clinical
signs and symptoms. Wang Qing-Ren, for example, lists fifty
different symptoms that can be treated with just one of his
formulas. This is because blood, like qi, is the essential foun-
dation of all physiological processes, and its disorders will
thus be reflected in almost every body system.

Patterns of blood stasis are qualified and differentiated in
terms of the various yin and yang organs involved; the etio-
logical factors of cold, heat, deficiency, and excess; different
qualities of disharmony expressed in terms of acute, chronic,
mild, and severe; and unusual symptoms such as swelling,
pain, and urgency.

Prominent among the etiological factors that contribute
to the occurrence of blood stagnation or stasis are the fol-
lowing:

* Qi disharmony, including both deficient and stagnant qi,
may lead to blood stagnation since ‘qi is the commander of
the blood’ and ‘qi leads the blood.’ When the qi is unable to
properly move the blood, it may stagnate in the channels.
Such is the case in poststroke hemiplegia, which occurs as a
result of qi deficiency and blood stagnation leading to ob-
struction of the channels by blood stasis. Herbs that tonify
the qi, such as Ginseng Radix (ren shen), Codonopsis Radix
(dang shen), Astragali Radix (hudng qi), and Polygonati
Rhizoma (hudng jing), can be used in formulas for these
conditions. Chronic qi stagnation may produce patterns of
blood stagnation with various degrees of severity as the loss
of proper qi circulation begins to influence the harmonious
movement of blood. For this reason, these formulas often
contain herbs that regulate the qi such as Aurantii Fructus
(zhi ke), Linderae Radix (wit yato), Dalbergiae odoriferae
Lignum (jidng xiang), or Cyperi Rhizoma (xidng ft).


Formulas that Invigorate the Blood and Dispel Blood Stasis 559

¢ Blood deficiency is also intrinsically related to blood stasis.
Blood that is deficient readily becomes static and, in turn,
static blood interferes with the production of new blood.
Without the production of new blood, it is very difficult to
dispel blood stasis. This can lead to a vicious cycle. For this
reason, it is very common to include herbs that tonify the
blood in these formulas, such as Angelicae sinensis Radix
(dang gui), Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di hudng),
Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi shdo), Polygoni multiflori Radix
(he shou wii), and Asini Corii Colla (e jido).

°

Cold inhibits the free movement of blood and will gradu-
ally produce blood stasis with such manifestations as de-
layed menstruation with clots, fixed abdominal masses,
and amenorrhea, any of which may be accompanied by
abdominal distention and pain. The warming herbs used in
these circumstances include Evodiae Fructus (wu zhi yi),
Cinnamomi Ramulus (gu? zhi), Cinnamomi Cortex (rdu
gui), Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jidng), and Foeniculi Fruc-
tus (xido hui xiang).

Heat influences the blood when it occurs in organs that
have an intimate relationship with the blood or when it
enters the nutritive or blood levels of the body. This may
produce blood stagnation by ‘steaming’ or drying the
blood, which causes it to thicken, and by the tendency of
thickened blood to become stagnant and congeal. Heat
may also induce the reckless movement of blood such that
it leaves the vessels and produces rash, nosebleed, vomit-
ing or spitting up blood, coughing up blood, and blood
in the urine or stool. When bleeding occurs internally,
the blood may become congealed in the tissues outside
of the vessels. The cooling herbs that are commonly used
in these circumstances include Moutan Cortex (mu dan
pt), Paeoniae Radix rubra (chi shdo), Rehmanniae Radix
(sheng di hudng), and Scrophulariae Radix (xudn shen).

Other etiologies of blood stasis include traumatic injury, the
birthing process, and surgery. Because of the variety of etio-
logical factors and clinical manifestations, the practitioner
must be flexible in adapting the formula to fit the particular
circumstances of the case.

It is important to remember that, because the properties
of this class of formulas are quite strong for attacking firm
and congealed conditions in order to break up and drain
them, they should be prescribed with caution in the weak or
elderly, or in patients with patterns of deficiency. And because
some of the formulas strongly invigorate the blood and dispel
blood stasis, they are contraindicated during pregnancy and
in most cases involving excessive menstrual bleeding. Nor
should they be used in patients with bleeding diathesis or any
active hemorrhagic disorder.

« This is one in a family of formulas that order the qi as a means
# of expelling accumulation and clumping. It is named after one
of its chief ingredients, Persicae Semen (tdo ren} or peach pit.

H Actions Drains heat and breaks up blood stasis

Indications

Acute lower abdominal pain, smooth urination, night fevers,
delirious speech, irritability, restlessness and thirst, and a
submerged, full, or choppy pulse. In more severe cases, there
may be manic behavior. Women will usually experience dys-
menorrhea or amenorrhea.

This is blood buildup (% s@ xis xue) in the lower burner
caused by the accumulation of blood stasis and heat. The
source text attributes this condition to the transmission of
an externally-contracted pathogenic influence into the lower
burner. The static blood and heat obstruct the lower burner
and cause acute lower abdominal pain. The buildup of blood
disturbs the lower burner but does not disrupt the transfor-
mation of the Bladder qi, so urination is normal. Because the
heat is in the blood level, there is feverishness at night. The
Heart governs the blood and is the organ from which the
clarity of spirit emanates. Here the retained heat rises and
disturbs the spirit, producing abnormal and chaotic manifes-
tations of the spirit such as delirious speech, irritability, rest-
lessness, and thirst, or, in more severe cases, manic behavior.
Moreover, the accumulation and stasis of blood in the lower
abdomen inhibits blood circulation and causes amenorrhea
or dysmenorrhea in women.

men (tdo ren) and Cinnamomi Ramulus (gu? zhi) have been
added. This changes it from a formula that purges clumping
