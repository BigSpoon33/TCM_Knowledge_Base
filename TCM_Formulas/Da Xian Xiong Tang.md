Formulas that Rescue Devastated Yang 275

This is a cold inversion pattern most typically associated
with a lesser yin disorder. Cold is a yin pathogenic influence
that readily injures the yang qi. The fire at the gate of vital-
ity, which is the foundation of the body’s yang qi, is respon-
sible for transmitting warmth to all the organs. When cold
invades the interior and injures this fire, its warming function
is inhibited, which is manifested in various signs of deficiency
and cold. The most typical of these are extreme cold in the
extremities, aversion to cold, curling up when lying down,
and lethargy with a constant desire to sleep.

The Spleen and Stomach, which transform food and flu-
ids into refined essence, depend on the fire at the gate of vital-
ity to carry out their respective functions. When it is deficient,
the middle burner is reduced to a ‘cauldron without a fire
underneath;’ thus it cannot digest, assimilate, transform, or
transport the essence of food and fluids. As a result, the clear
yang cannot ascend, nor can the turbid yin properly descend.
Vomiting, diarrhea with undigested food particles, and an
absence of thirst ensue. Because cold contracts, congeals, and
stagnates, congealed cold and qi stagnation causes pain and
cold in the abdomen.

The yang qi also nourishes the spirit. When the yang qi
is sufficient, the spirit will be vigorous, but when the spirit is
deprived of nourishment, it will weaken, which manifests as
lethargy and a desire to sleep. A pale tongue with a white, slip-
pery coating and a submerged or faint and thin pulse are also
indicative of yang deficiency with internal cold. The wording
of the source text makes clear that the pulse here is thin not
because the yin or blood is deficient, but because it is primar-
ily faint, implying that there is insufficient yang to move the
pulse, which therefore becomes thin. This interpretation fol-
lows a passage in Chapter 39 of Basic Questions: “The cold qi
enters into the channels and slows down [their flow]. They
trickle but do not move. [If cold] lodges outside of the blood
vessels, the blood will be lacking. If it lodges within the blood
vessels, the qi is obstructed.”

Analysis of Formula

The basic strategy for treating severe cold that has entered
deeply into the interior is outlined in Chapter 74 of Basic
Questions: “Cold pernicious qi in the interior is treated with
sweet, heating [herbs] assisted by bitter, acrid [herbs]” and,
“If a cold pernicious qi is victorious, it can be levelled by
means of acrid, heating [herbs].”

When the yang is debilitated and the yin flourishes, as
reflected in a faint pulse and frigid extremities, one must use
a strongly heating and acrid herb to break through the yin
and revive the yang. Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu
zi) serves this purpose and is therefore designated as the chief
herb in the formula. It is especially effective in warming and
stimulating the fire at the gate of vitality so that it dissemi-
nates
