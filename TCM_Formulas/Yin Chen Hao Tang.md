340 Chapter 8 / Formulas that Tonify

that the growth of yin depends in the last instance on the
generative capacities of yang.

* The second view, represented by Wang Ang in Medical For-
mulas Collected and Analyzed, assumes that the formula
treats deficiency of both the qi and blood and thus needs
two different herbs to deal with these two problems.

¢ A third group of physicians, represented by Wang Fu in
Collectanea of Investigations from the Realm of Medicine,
holds that Astragali Radix (hudng qi) tonifies the Spleen
and Stomach as the postnatal source of blood.

* A fourth position, represented by Zhang Bin-Cheng in Con-
venient Reader of Established Formulas, is that it is used as
an emergency measure to secure floating yang.

* Finally, a fifth group of physicians, represented by Chen
Nian-Zu in Compendium of Songs on Modern Formulas,
argues that the fever treated by this formula is due to unre-
solved heat constrained at the level of the skin and hair. In
the opinion of these physicians, Astragali Radix (hudng qi)
is light and slightly warming so that it can enter this part of
the body from which it clears heat by promoting sweating.

Although all five perspectives are validated by the indications
for which this formula has been used, that of Zhang Bin-
Cheng appears to come closest to the original indications.
As outlined above, Li Dong-Yuan specifically composed this
formula to treat a pattern resembling White Tiger Decoction
(bdi hi tang), from which it is distinguished merely by the
deficient pulse. If White Tiger Decoction (bdi hii tang) treats
patterns where the outward dispersion of yang qi has become
excessive, this implies that the present formula must treat pat-
terns of deficiency characterized by the same pathodynamic.
This justifies the large dosage of Astragali Radix (hudng qi)
and its use as chief herb in the formula. Many commenta-
tors therefore suggest that the dosage of this herb be reduced
considerably if the formula is used to treat blood deficiency
without floating yang or combined qi and blood deficiency.

Comparisons
> Vs. WHITE TIGER Decoction (bdi hii tang)

Both formulas treat feverishness, hot sensations in the mus-
cles, flushing, irritability, restlessness, and other symptoms of
heat through to the exterior. White Tiger Decoction (bdi hi
tang) treats patterns of yang brightness excess, as reflected
in thirst with a desire for cold drinks, profuse sweating, and
a flooding, excessive pulse that is forceful when pressed. By
contrast, Tangkuei Decoction to Tonify the Blood (dang gui
bii xue tang) treats patterns of deficiency where the qi in the
exterior is too weak to contain the yang. This is reflected in
thirst with a desire for warm drinks, sweating aggravated by
exertion, and a large but deficient pulse that appears strong at
the surface but is revealed as weak with pressure.

> Vs. OTHER FORMULAS THAT TREAT HEAT DUE TO
Qi Dericiency

This is one of a number of different formulas that can be
used to treat internal heat due to qi deficiency, where the use
of bitter, cold, heat-draining or sweet, cooling, yin-nourish-
ing herbs and formulas would be contraindicated. Tangkuei
Decoction to Tonify the Blood (dang gui bu xuee tang) treats
patterns characterized by blood deficiency failing to secure
the yang, which then floats to the exterior. Rambling Powder
(xiao ydo sdn) or Six-Gentlemen Decoction (li jin zi tang)
plus Bupleuri Radix (chdi hu) can be used to treat patterns
where the yang qi becomes constrained in the interior. Tonify
the Middle to Augment the Qi Decoction (bu zhong yi qi
tang) treats yang qi constraint due to failure of the clear qi
to ascend. Tonify Spleen-Stomach, Drain Yin Fire, and Raise
Yang Decoction (bii pi wei xie yin hud sheng ydng tang) treats
patterns characterized by relatively severe constraint and fire
exess due to inability of the qi to manage the ascent and de-
scent of fire. Finally, Minor Construct the Middle Decoction
(xido jian zhong tang) treats patterns characterized by nutri-
tive qi deficiency leading to a relative excess of protective qi.

> Vs. TANGKUEI AND SIX- YELLOW DECOCTION
(dang gui lit hudng tang)

Both of these formulas treat flushing and feverishness and
contain the synergistic combination of Astragali Radix
(hudng qi) and Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui). How-
ever, Tangkuei and Six-Yellow Decoction (dang gui lit hudng
tang) focuses on enriching the yin and draining excess fire
while the function of stabilizing the exterior in order to con-
trol sweating is secondary. It is therefore used to treat fever
and night sweats accompanied by a dry mouth and parched
lips, irritability, dry stools, dark and scanty urine, a red, dry
tongue, and a rapid pulse. Tangkuei Decoction to Tonify the
Blood (dang gui bi xue tang), on the other hand, focuses on
tonifying deficient qi in the exterior. For this reason, it uses a
very large dosage of Astragali Radix (hudng qi), but none of
the bitter, cooling, or yin-tonifying herbs used in Tangkuei
and Six-Yellow Decoction (dang gui litt hudng tang).

_ Actions Warms the menses, dispels blood stasis, and nourishes
" the blood

Indications

Overdue menses with scanty menstrual flow (often with blood
clots) and pain and distention in the lower abdomen before
and during menses. The pulse is submerged and strong.

The main causes of overdue menses are qi constraint,
phlegm obstruction, blood cold, blood deficiency, and blood
stasis. Delayed Menstruation Drink (gud gi yin) addresses
the disorder when it stems from blood deficiency and blood
stasis in patients who tend to be cold. As might be expected,
these factors give rise to stagnant qi as well. This combina-
tion of factors inhibits the free flow of blood and menses, and
causes pain and distention in the lower abdomen.

Analysis of Formula

Failure of blood to move smoothly is regarded as a condition
of excess, while scanty menstrual flow is a sign of deficiency.
Thus, the pattern to which this formula attends is considered
to be one of excess within deficiency. The principle of treat-
ment should be to promote movement through areas of stasis
and constraint and to tonify what is insufficient.

The formula uses Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shi di
hudng) to nourish and tonify the blood, replenish the es-
sence, and tonify the body. Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang
gui) nourishes and invigorates the blood, warms the menses,
and relieves pain. The combination of these two herbs tonifies
insufficiency in the nutritive level and the blood. Because this
is the primary source of the problem, these are considered the
chief herbs. The deputies are Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chudn
xiong), Carthami Flos (heng hud), Persicae Semen (tdo ren),
and Curcumae Rhizoma (e zhi), which invigorate the blood
and move stasis. Two of the assistants are Akebiae Caulis (mi
tong), which promotes the flow of fluids, and Cyperi Rhizoma
(xiang fu), which supports the body’s qi dynamic. These eight
herbs work together to remedy qi constraint, blood stasis, and
stagnant fluids. Of these three pathologies, the emphasis is on
managing blood stasis without exacerbating the underlying
deficiency. Similarly, the deficiency is tonified without exac-
erbating the stagnation of blood and qi. Since the patient for
whom this formula is intended is inclined toward cold, Cin-
namomi Cortex (rdu gui) is included as an assistant to warm
the lower burner and thwart congealing and clumping from
cold. Cramping pain in the lower abdomen accounts for the
inclusion of the last two assisants, Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan
cdo) and Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi shdo), to soften the Liver
and moderate the pain. Cold contributes to the congealing
of blood and intensifies blood stasis by causing the vessels to
contract. Warm and acrid Cinnamomi Cortex (rou gui) can
disperse cold, and for this reason is combined with Glycyr-
rhizae Radix (gan cdo) and Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi shdo) as
a remedy for cold abdominal pain. The formula nourishes the
blood and moves stasis, dispels the cold (a function some-
times expressed as warming the menses), and relieves the
pain. It moves and disperses without depleting the yin-blood,
and nourishes the yin-blood without causing further stasis.

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula is inappropriate for those who do not present
with blood deficiency and cold. Also, because it contains
blood-moving agents, it should not be given to those who
bleed heavily during menses or to those who may be preg-
nant.

Commentary

Wang Ken-Tang, the author of the source text, opens his dis-
cussion of menstrual timing with a quote from the Ming-


342 Chapter 8 / Formulas that Tonify

dynasty physician Wang Zi-Heng: “when yang is in excess,
the [menses] will arrive early, when yin is incomplete, [the
menses] will be delayed.” The implication of this statement is
that yin-blood deficiency (incomplete yin) is a main cause of
overdue menses. Wang goes on to say that this formula treats
overdue menses and inhibited menstrual flow when these
symptoms are due to blood deficiency and stagnant qi.

Wang recognized that there are many factors that can give
rise to overdue menses and provided the following advice
from Zhu Dan-Xi:

For scanty menstrual flow that arrives late, [use] Chuanx-
iong Rhizoma (chudn xidng), Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang
gui), Ginseng Radix (ren shen), Atractylodis macrocephalae
Rhizoma (bdi zhi), and phlegm herbs. If the late-arriving
menstrual flow is pale in color [and] phlegm is copious, [use]
Two-Aged [Herb] Decoction (er chen tang) adding Chuanxiong
Rhizoma (chuan xidng) and Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang
gui), If the late-arriving menstrual flow is purple and has clots,
[this is] blood heat. There will be pain. [Use]Four-Substance
Decoction (s? wit tang) modified with Cyperi Rhizoma (xiang
fu) and Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn).

Wang further cited the Ming-dynasty physician Xue Ji-
Zhuan, who emphasized treating the blood deficiency that is
the basis of this disorder:

For late-arriving periods owing to Spleen channel blood
deficiency, Ginseng Decoction to Nourish Luxuriance (ren shen
yang ying tang) is suitable. If the cause is scant Liver blood, Six-
Flavor Pill with Rehmannia (liu wei di hudng wan) is appropri-
ate. If the root is qi deficiency and weakness of blood, Eight-
Treasure Decoction (bd zhen tang) is fitting.

Clinically, it is helpful to combine these formulas with De-
layed Menstruation Drink (gud qi yin) when the stasis is
mild. If, however, the stasis is severe, it is best to clear the
stasis before tonifying.

Most modern practitioners consider the original dosages
for this formula to be too small. One should therefore increase
various ingredients according to the patient’s presenting pat-
tern. If blood deficiency is paramount, increase Angelicae
sinensis Radix (dang gui) and Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di
hudng). If stasis is dominant and deficiency is not extreme,
increase the dosage of Carthami Flos (heng hud), Persicae Se-
men (tdo ren), and Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chudn xieng).

Though originally intended for overdue menses, this for-
mula is now also used for painful menstruation owing to
blood deficiency and stasis of qi and blood. In this case, it is
usually given for 4-5 days prior to the onset of the period and
is continued through the first day of the period.

Comparison

> Vs. Four-SuBSTANCE DECOCTION WITH SAFFLOWER AND
PEacu Pir (tdo hong si wit tang)

Delayed Menstruation Drink (gud qi yin) can be seen as a
warmer variation of Four-Substance Decoction with Saf-
flower and Peach Pit (tdo heng si wi tang), which can also
move the qi and fluids. It is thus well-suited for a woman with
overdue menses together with fluid retention and qi stagna-
tion (manifesting as discomfort in the lower abdomen and
emotional distress). If, on the other hand, the main symptoms
associated with overdue menses are heavily clotted blood, a
purple tongue, and stabbing pain, Four-Substance Decoction
with Safflower and Peach Pit (tdo heng si wit tang) may be a
better choice.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders, particu-
larly those affecting women such as irregular menstruation
and dysmenorrhea.

Modifications

° Where the cold is extreme and the lower abdominal pain is
relieved by warmth, add Evodiae Fructus (wti zhii yii), Foe-
niculi Fructus (xido huf xiang), and Zingiberis Rhizoma
(gan jidng).

* For qi stagnation, add Linderae Radix (wii yao).

¢ If dampness is present or fluid retention is extreme, add
Poria (fii ling) and Atractylodis Rhizoma (cang zhi).

¢ For phlegm, add Poria (fu ling), Citri reticulatae Pericar-
pium (chen pi), and Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhi
ban xia).

Formulas that Tonify the Blood 343

Indications

Amenorrhea of gradual onset from long-term blood defi-
ciency. Attendant symptoms include general disquietude,
gradually worsening afternoon tidal fevers, emaciation, and
achy and uncomfortable flesh and bones of the hands and
feet. The formula also treats irregular menstruation or scanty
menses from deficiency of yin and blood accompanied by
blood stasis.

The source text puts the above symptoms in the context
of “yin deficiency blood weakness [which allows] yang to
roam and overwhelm. Scarce water cannot extinguish the
abundance of fire [leaving] fire to accelerate its drying ef-
fect on water [thus resulting in] devastation of fluids.” The
author goes on to say that the treatment principle in such
circumstances is to “nourish the blood and augment the yin.
One should be cautious not to use toxic herbs to unblock.”
The text also mentions that, despite obvious heat signs, one
should not use cool herbs such as Artemisiae annuae Herba
(qing hao) in this situation because to do so would cause the
blood to congeal, which would aggravate the disorder.

Analysis of Formula

The formula contains mild and moderate herbs to gently
nourish and move the blood and nourish the Heart. The chief
herb, Platycladi Semen (bai zi ren), is a good example of the
gentle and nourishing nature of this formula. Comprehensive
Outline of the Materia Medica states that this herb:

Nourishes Heart qi, moistens Kidney dryness, quiets the ethe-
real soul, and settles the corporeal soul. Its nature is balanced,
and it is neither cold nor drying. Its flavor is sweet and tonify-
ing, it is acrid and yet can moisten, its qi is clear and fragrant,
and it can penetrate the Heart and Kidney and augment the
Spleen and Stomach.

Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di hudng), the deputy
herb, enriches the Kidney yin and nourishes the blood, thus
addressing the two main causes of the disorder. Achyranthis
bidentatae Radix (niti xi) nourishes the Liver and Kidney,
invigorates the blood, dispels stasis, and guides the blood
downward. Dipsaci Radix (xi dudn) tonifies the Liver but
can also break up blood stasis. Because the author of this
formula wanted to avoid strong moving herbs for this pat-
tern, the movement of the blood is promoted with herbs that
tonify or nourish as they promote movement.

Lycopi Herba (ze dn) is a blood-moving agent that is ac-
rid, bitter, fragrant, and drying. It is often contraindicated in
cases of blood deficiency. In this formula, however, its drying
nature is offset by the inclusion of a large dosage of Rehman-
niae Radix preparata (shu di hudng). The acrid, dispersing,
and fragrant Spleen-arousing nature of Lycopi Herba (ze len)
also helps to obviate the stagnation that Rehmanniae Radix
preparata (shi di hudng) might otherwise engender. Lycopi
Herba (ze [en) unblocks the menses, invigorates the blood,

and dispels stasis. It joins with the more moderate Achyran-
this bidentatae Radix (niti xi) and Dipsaci Radix (xis duan) to
move the blood and dispel stasis.

The last of the four assistants is Selaginellae tamariscinae
Herba (#44 judn bdi), which has the English name of tama-
riskoid spikemoss. It is acrid and neutral, enters the Liver and
Heart channels, and stops bleeding when charred, but other-
wise invigorates the blood and unblocks the channels.

Commentary

In the early 20th-century gynecology text Compendium of
Secrets for Women’s Diseases, Chen Lian-Fang cites Arborvi-
tae Seed Pill for Women’s Disorders (nii ke bdi zi ren wan) as
one of the four formulas for the treatment of withered-blood
amenorrhea (2 4448 Pl xue kit jing bi), which is one of the
two main categories of amenorrhea, the other being blood
obstruction (.t2 hi xue ge). The two can be distinguished by
studying the history of the disorder and its attendant symp-
toms. In the same text, Zhang Jing-Yue notes:

Liver disease withered-blood pattern and blood-obstruction
pattern are similar, both displaying the symptom of amenor-
rhea. [However, in truth,] they are as different as ice and hot
coals. Withering [signals] exhaustion, blood deficiency in the
extreme. Obstruction [signals] blockage; the blood’s founda-
tion is not deficient [and there is evidence of] rebellion [from]
qi [stagnation], cold, or accumulation.

The onset may be gradual in both patterns, but the pres-
ence of pain or other symptoms of rebellion and excess in
the blood-obstruction type, and the attendant symptoms of
blood and yin deficiency in the blood-withering type, are im-
portant markers for differentiation. Chen Lian-Fang suggests
Arborvitae Seed Pill for Women’s Disorders (nii ke bdi zi ren
wdn) for withered-blood amenorrhea in patients who exhibit
blood deficiency with fire from yin deficiency. The thinking
here matches that of the formula’s author, Chen Zi-Ming, who
stated that the formula is for women who are “gradually los-
ing weight, have irritating pain in the flesh and bones of the
hands and feet, gradually worsening tidal fevers, and a faint
and rapid pulse.”

Although it treats patients with signs of deficiency fire,
Arborvitae Seed Pill for Women’s Disorders (ni ke bdi zi ren
wdn) is a warm and nourishing formula. Its author warned
against the use of cold herbs that would aggravate the stag-
nation and damage the yin and qi. Instead, he advised that
withered-blood amenorrhea required the use of nourishing
and gently moving agents, as the signs of heat will fall away
naturally as their root cause is eradicated.
