48 Chapter 1 / Formulas that Release the Exterior

The ascending action of Platycodi Radix (jie geng) and
the descending action of Aurantii Fructus (zhi ke) is a very ef-
fective combination for regulating the flow of qi in the chest,
thereby relieving the symptoms of discomfort in the chest.
These two herbs also interact with Peucedani Radix (qgidn
hu) to improve the circulation of Lung qi, expel phlegm, and
stop the coughing. The phlegm that collects in the Lungs
is produced in the Spleen. For this reason, Peucedani Ra-
dix (gidn hui) is used with Poria (fu ling), which transforms
phlegm and strengthens the Spleen, and Zingiberis Rhizoma
recens (sheng jidng) to treat both the branch and root of this
disorder. Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jiang) also helps
release the exterior. All of these herbs serve as assistants.

The tonifying herbs in this formula include Ginseng Ra-
dix (ren shen), Poria (fui ling), and Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan
cdo). These are three of the four herbs in Four-Gentlemen
Decoction (si jin zi tang), discussed in Chapter 8. Ginseng
Radix (ren shen), an assistant, serves three functions here:
it strengthens the normal qi to expel the pathogenic influ-
ences, generates fluids so that sweating becomes possible, and
strengthens the body’s resistance to invasion, which prevents
a relapse. Another assistant, Poria (ft ling), leaches out damp-
ness, promotes urination, transforms phlegm, and strengthens
the Spleen. It tonifies without causing stagnation or retention
of pathogenic influences, unlike the tonic herb Atractylodis
macrocephalae Rhizoma (bdi zhti). The envoy, Glycyrrhizae
Radix (gan cdo), assists Ginseng Radix (ren shen) in tonifying
the qi, and also harmonizes the actions of the other ingredi-
ents.

Commentary

This formula was originally devised for children suffering
from externally-contracted wind-cold-dampness. Because
the source qi in children is not fully developed, a strategy
was required that would tonify the qi in order to expel the
pathogenic influences. Later, the application of this formula
was expanded to include all cases of wind-cold-dampness in
patients with underlying qi deficiency and phlegm-dampness
obstructing the qi dynamic, including the elderly, postpar-
tum women, and those recovering from a debilitating illness.

Controversies

Most of the debate surrounding this formula has focused on
the precise function of Ginseng Radix (ren shen). Its use in
formulas designed to expel external pathogens can be traced
back to several formulas in Discussion on Cold Damage, in-
cluding Cinnamon Twig and Ginseng Decoction (gui zhi ren
shen tang) and Minor Bupleurum Decoction (xido chdi hu
tang). However, whereas the role of Ginseng Radix (ren shen)
in these formulas is generally regarded as merely strengthen-
ing the source gi and the middle burner, influential Qing-era
physicians like Yu Chang, Zhang Lu, and Zhang Bing-Cheng

extended its role here to include the active enhancement of
the function of the chief ingredients in pushing pathogens
back to the outside. Wu Ju-Tong, the famous systematizer of
warm pathogen disease therapeutics, even went so far as to
designate Ginseng Radix (ren shen) as the chief herb in this
formula. However, these interpretations were criticized by Fei
Bo-Xiong, who generally favored ordering the qi dynamic in
all disorders, and therefore viewed Ginseng Radix (ren shen)
as addressing any deficiency.

A clear and useful understanding of the formula is pro-
vided by Zhao Yu-Huang in Discussion of Famous Physicians’
Formulas Past and Present. He thought of this formula as a
complement to Nine-Herb Decoction with Notopterygium
(jit wei ging hud tang), discussed earlier in this chapter.
Both formulas were composed during the same period, have
the same chief herb, and treat an invasion of wind-cold-
dampness or unseasonable qi that relies on sweating in order
to expel the pathogen. Zhao Yu-Huang notes that such sweat-
ing can only be produced if the body has sufficient fluids
and qi. Nine-Herb Decoction with Notopterygium (jit wei
qidng hue tang) uses Radix Rehmanniae Glutinosae (sheng
di hudng) to increase the fluids where they are deficient. The
present formula similarly employs Ginseng Radix (ren shen)
to tonify the qi.

The Qing physician Yu Chang extended the indication of
this formula to treat early-stage, wind-cold-damp dysenteric
disorders with exterior symptoms, which he believed were
caused by a sinking of the pathogenic influences into the In-
testines, This approach, known as ‘hauling the boat upstream’
(ni lid wan zhou %& #i,4% F-), remains popular today, but at the
time represented a major departure from standard practice.
Unlike diarrhea, which is a pathology of middle burner qi
transformation, dysenteric disorders are thought to be due
to pathogens (mainly damp-heat toxin) obstructing the flow
of qi in the Intestines. The preferred treatment strategy for
resolving this pathology is to follow the inherent dynamic of
the disorder (where pathogens move inward and downward)
and the physiology of the organ systems involved (the qi of
the bowels moves downward) by draining the damp-heat and
regulating the qi and blood. Yu Chang’s approach moves in
the opposite direction, employing herbs that are ascending
and that dispel pathogens from the surface. This ascending
movement is what ‘hauling the boat upstream’ refers to.

Examined more closely, however, Yu Chang’s treatment
strategy also facilitates the physiological movement of qi in
the Intestines by removing obstruction from both the Lungs
(tied to the Large Intestine via an interior/exterior relation-
ship) and the qi dynamic. It represents a further develop-
ment in an approach to the treatment of early-stage dysen-
teric disorders already embodied in Kudzu Decoction (ge
gen tang), which stops diarrhea by dispelling pathogens from
the exterior of the greater yang and yang brightness chan-

nels. Both formulas treat early-stage dysentery characterized
by fever and chills. However, Kudzu Decoction (ge gen tang)
supplements the fluids and stops spasms in the bowels, and is
thus indicated where wind symptoms predominate. Ginseng
Powder to Overcome Pathogenic Influences (ren shen bai di
sdn), on the other hand, opens the gi dynamic and promotes
water metabolism and is thus indicated where dampness pre-
dominates.

The principal formula is also used for very early-stage
measles (before the rash has begun to surface) characterized
by moderate fever and chills, no significant thirst, loose stools,
a white tongue coating, and a thin, weak pulse. The modern
physician Yue Mei-Zhong has extended this application and
uses the formula in the treatment of deep-seated sores and
boils in cases with qi deficiency.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders, primar-
ily acute infections, including the common cold, influenza,
mumps, bronchitis, dysentery, and the early stages of boils.
It has also been used for allergic dermatitis, urticaria, and
eczema,

Cautions and Contraindications

Because of the warm, drying properties of many of the in-
gredients, it is important to remember that this formula is in-
dicated only for externally-contracted wind-cold-dampness
and is contraindicated for cases due to heat or damp-heat.

cook until 3 cups remain. The strained decoction is taken warm
in 3 doses over the course of a day. At present, Aconiti Radix
lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi) is cooked for 30-60 minutes (at least
until there is no numbing of the tongue upon tasting), and then
the other ingredients are added to the decoction.

Actions Assists the yang and releases the exterior

Indications

Slight fever with severe chills that is not relieved by wearing
more clothing or adding covers, exhaustion with an almost
constant desire to sleep, and a submerged, faint pulse.

This is exterior cold in a patient with preexisting yang
deficiency. In terms of the six warps of disease, this is a simul-
taneous greater yang (exterior cold) and lesser yin (interior
yang deficiency) warp disorder. A sensation of extreme cold
may be attributed to either internal cold or externally-con-
tracted wind-cold. In this case, the presence of fever indicates
an externally-contracted pathogenic influence. The chills are
due to both interior cold (which in other circumstances can
be reduced by adding layers of clothes) and exterior cold (for
which additional layers are of no use). Normally, people with
yang deficiency have a hard time staying warm, much less
developing a fever; the presence of even a slight fever here is
evidence of externally-contracted wind-cold. However, the
pulse in an exterior condition should be floating; here it is
submerged, which (along with the exhaustion and desire to
sleep) shows that the interior is deficient.

Analysis of Formula

Wind-cold in the exterior is treated by sweating. However,
in cases of yang deficiency, the use of this method readily
leads to devastated yang because sweating also disperses the
already deficient yang in the exterior. Therefore, the appro-
priate strategy in such cases is to combine discharging the
exterior (greater yang) with assisting the yang in the inte-
rior (lesser yin). For this reason, the chief herb is warm, ac-
rid Ephedrae Herba (md hudng), which induces sweating,
releases the exterior, and disperses cold. The deputy is the
very acrid and warm Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi
fic zi), which warms the Kidneys and assists the yang. This is
an excellent pairing for this condition because, in the inte-
rior, Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fi: zi) activates the
yang qi to help it push out the pathogen, while in the exterior,
Ephedrae Herba (md hudng) opens up the skin and pores so
that the pathogen can be dispersed. The Qing-dynasty physi-
cian Ke Qin cogently summed up the interaction between
these two herbs:
