Actions Breaks up and dispels blood stasis

Indications

Firmness and distention of the lower abdomen, smooth uri-
nation, manic behavior, forgetfulness, black stools that are
easy to expel, and a submerged and slow-irregular pulse. In
women, there may also be delayed menstruation or amenor-
thea. Also treats jaundice.

This is blood buildup in the lower burner caused by
clumping of heat and blood. The heat causes the blood to be-
come thick, slowing its flow and causing stasis. This becomes
apparent in the firmness and distention of the lower abdo-
men. Because the stasis is at the level of the blood and not the
qi, urination is not impeded and the stools are easy to expel.
Black stools, delayed menstruation, or amenorrhea, however,
indicates that the movement and generation of blood is ab-
normal. The Heart is the organ that governs the generation of
blood and harbors the spirit. When the static heat flushes up-
ward to harass the Heart spirit, this leads to manic behavior.
Blood stasis impeding the production of new blood, on the
other hand, is reflected in forgetfulness. The submerged pulse
identifies this as an interior problem, while its slowness and
irregularity reflect blood stasis. Jaundice is a sign of damp-
heat. This can occur when yang brightness excess heat (rather
than greater yang cold that has transformed into heat) is the
root cause of the problem.

Analysis of Formula

The symptoms that characterize the pattern treated by this
formula indicate that the stasis is severe, and that the momen-
tum of the disorder is progressing. In this situation, mild pur-
gation is no longer appropriate, and attacking with strong-
acting, stasis-breaking substances is the appropriate strategy.
For this purpose, the formula employs two animal medicinals
as chief ingredients. Salty, bitter, neutral, and slightly toxic
Hirudo (shui zhi) enters the Liver channel and, in the words
of the Divine Husbandman’s Classic of the Materia Medica,
“expels noxious blood and static blood” In Essays on Medi-
cine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western, Zhang

Xi-Chun observes that this substance has the special charac-
teristic of entering only the blood aspect, allowing it to ex-
pel static blood without damaging the qi. Slightly bitter and
slightly cooling Tabanus (meng cheng) also enters the Liver
channel and is even stronger than Hirudo (shui zhi) in break-
ing up blood stasis. Amplifying each other's characteristics,
these two substances have a synergy that makes this one of
the strongest blood stasis-expelling formulas. The addition of
Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) and Persicae Semen (tdo
ren) further reinforces this effect. Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da
hudng) also opens the bowels, following the momentum of
the pathology (i.e., the downward movement of heat and its
clumping in the lower burner) to create a route for the heat
to leave the body, as noted in Basic Questions (Chapter 5):
“Draining downward is guiding out and exhausting [what is
stagnating internally].”

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula is indicated only for excess-type blood stasis
patterns in the lower burner. It should not be prescribed in
case of deficiency or during pregnancy.

Commentary

This formula treats late-stage blood buildup in the lower
burner, where heat has substantially dried up the blood and
caused palpable hardness.

Use of Animal Substances

Because this is a deep-seated condition located entirely at
the blood level, the formula uses animal substances to break
up stasis. Many physicians agree with Ke Qin, quoted in the
Golden Mirror of the Medical Traditions: “When static blood
is indicated by signs such as these, only harsh prescriptions
are capable of reaching the lair [of the pathogen] and are
appropriate for carrying out the weighty task [of flushing it
out].” In Selected Annotations to Ancient Formulas from the
Garden of Crimson Snow, the Qing-dynasty commentator
Want Zi-Jie explains why this is so:

Blood buildup belongs to [disorders characterized] by dead yin.
The true qi moves [normally] but can [no longer] enter into it.
Therefore, herbs alone are unable to treat this pathogen. One
must use those nimble creatures that have a liking for blood in
order to guide {the static blood] out. [Medicinals made from]
flying [creatures] move through the yang collaterals. [Those
made from creatures] that live under water move through the
yin collaterals. [In this formula, Tabanus (meng chong) and
Hirudo (shui zhi)| thus guide Persicae Semen (tdo ren) toward.
attacking the blood, and Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) to
purge heat to break the merciless clumping of blood. It is truly
an appropriate formula for carrying out a difficult [task]. There
is no need to fear the venomous nature of these medicinals.

Wang Zi-Jie’s theory regarding the ability of animal sub-
stances to enter the collaterals has been especially influential.


564 Chapter 13 / Formulas that Regulate the Blood

It was further developed by the Qing-dynasty physician Ye
Tian-Shi, who used animal substances to treat stasis of the
collaterals; and it features prominently in the work of con-
temporary physicians such as Zhang Ci-Gong and Zhu Li-
ang-Chun, who argue that many chronic conditions can only
be helped by means of formulas containing such substances.
Influenced by these theories, the formula is used in contem-
porary China to treat disorders that are now associated with
blood stasis such as the sequelae of stroke, abnormal blood
lipids, or epilepsy. When this formula is prescribed for long-
term use or less acute manifestations, it is usually given as a
pill.

Comparisons

> Vs. Peacu Pir DecocTION TO ORDER THE Qt (tdo he
cheng qi tang)

Both of these formulas treat blood buildup in the lower burn-
er due to clumping of blood and heat by breaking up the
stasis and draining heat primarily through the bowels. Symp-
toms shared by both patterns include lower abdominal full-
ness and distention, manic behavior, and a submerged, rough
pulse. However, while Peach Pit Decoction to Order the Qi
(tdo he cheng qi tang) is used for treating the early stages of
blood buildup, Appropriate Decoction (di dang tang) is used
for the later stages of this disorder. Thus, while the abdomen
in the former pattern is tense, painful when pressed, and ac-
companied by a subjective sensation of clumping or fullness,
in the latter there will be palpable hardness with defined bor-
ders, Other differences include signs of yang qi constraint
(i.e., remnants of qi aspect symptoms) in the former, such
as flushing accompanied by cold extremities or constipation,
while in the latter, dark stools that can be passed easily indi-
cate that the disorder is now located solely at the blood level.
For this reason, Peach Pit Decoction to Order the Qi (tdo he
cheng qi tang) focuses more strongly on also ordering the qi,
while Appropriate Decoction (di dang tang) is much stronger
in terms of breaking up blood stasis.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a wide variety of biomedically-defined disorders.
These can be divided into the following groups:

* Gynecological and obstetrical disorders including acute
pelvic inflammatory disease, leiomyoma, endometriosis,
dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, retained placenta, and post-
partum thrombophlebitis

* Genitourinary disorders including benign prostatic hyper-
trophy, acute prostatitis, testicular tuberculosis, and acute
urinary retention

¢ Circulatory disorders including angina pectoris, cerebro-
vascular disease, and cor pulmonale

nia, and epilepsy.

This formula has also been used in the treatment of icteric

hepatitis, chronic colitis, habitual constipation, and schisto-
somiasis.

Drive Out Stasis from the

Mansion of Blood Decoction

xue fu zhu yi tang

A passage in Chapter 17 of Basic Questions observes that, “The
vessels are the mansions of the blood.” The 18th-century physi-
cian Wang Qing-Ren borrowed the name to denote the area
above the diaphragm that formed an enclosed space or ‘mansion’
that he believed was filled with blood. This formula treats the

symptoms that Wang Qing-Ren attributed to blood stasis in this
area.

Actions _Invigorates the blood, dispels blood stasis, spreads the
qi of the Liver, and unblocks the channels

Indications

Pain in the chest and hypochondria, chronic, stubborn head-
ache with a fixed, piercing quality, chronic, incessant hiccup,
a choking sensation when drinking, dry heaves, depression
or low spirits accompanied by a sensation of warmth in the
chest, palpitations, insomnia, restless sleep, irritability, ex-
treme mood swings, evening tidal fever, a dark red tongue,
dark spots on the sides of the tongue, dark or purplish lips,
complexion, or sclera, and a choppy or wiry, tight pulse

This is blood stasis in the ‘mansion of blood’ (2 At xue
fu) with impairment of blood flow in the area above the dia-
phragm. The stasis of blood obstructs the movement of qi
in the chest, which manifests as pain in the chest and hypo-
chondria. The obstruction also prevents the clear yang from

ascending to the head, causing a chronic, stubborn headache.
Blockage of the flow of blood in the channels from localized
blood stasis produces a characteristically fixed and piercing
type of headache pain. If blood stasis obstructs the Stomach,
the Stomach qi may rebel upward and manifest as incessant
hiccup, a choking sensation when drinking, or dry heaves.

Long-term blood stasis tends to transform into heat, and
constrained qi tends to transform into fire. Blood stasis may
also obstruct the blood vessels and prevent nourishment from
reaching the Heart. This combination of stasis, heat, and mal-
nourishment of the Heart may cause depression or low spirits
accompanied by a sensation of warmth in the chest, palpi-
tations, insomnia, restless sleep, irritability, extreme mood
swings, and evening tidal fever. The dark red tongue, dark
spots on the sides of the tongue, dark or purplish appearance
of the lips, complexion, or sclera, and the choppy or wiry,
tight pulse are all typical signs of chronic blood stasis and
constrained Liver qi.

Analysis of Formula

This formula is a variation on the combination of Four-Sub-
stance Decoction with Safflower and Peach Pit (tdo hong si
wit tng) and Frigid Extremities Powder (si ni sen). The chief
herbs are those which invigorate the blood and dispel blood
stasis, particularly in the upper part of the body: Persicae Se-
men (tdo ren), Carthami Flos (heng hud), and Chuanxiong
Rhizoma (chudn xieng). Two of the deputies, Paeoniae Ra-
dix rubra (chi shdo) and Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui),
also invigorate the blood, although their focus is lower in the
body. The latter also nourishes the blood and moistens. This,
along with the functions of another deputy, Rehmanniae Ra-
dix (sheng di hudng), which cools the blood and clears heat,
enables the formula to dispel blood stasis without injuring
the yin and blood. The final deputy, Cyathulae Radix (chudn
nit xi), improves the circulation by eliminating blood stasis
and inducing the downward movement of blood.

The assistant herbs include Bupleuri Radix (chdi hi),
which smoothes the flow of Liver qi, relieves constraint, and
raises the clear yang. In concert with the other assistants,
Platycodi Radix (jie geng) and Aurantii Fructus (zhi ke), it
expands the chest and promotes the movement of qi. By re-
lieving qi stagnation in the chest, these herbs promote the
movement of qi and thereby facilitate the movement of blood.
The envoy, Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo), regulates and har-
monizes the actions of the other herbs.

The value of this formula is that it not only invigorates
the blood and transforms stasis in the blood level, but also
relieves constraint in the qi level. It invigorates the blood
without consuming it, and dispels blood stasis while encour-
aging the production of new blood. It facilitates the upward
and downward flow of gi and harmonizes the circulation
of blood, following the adage, “If the qi circulates, then the

blood will circulate.”

The dosage of particular herbs in this formula may be ad-
justed based on the relative importance of blood stasis versus
qi stagnation in the particular patient.

Cautions and Contraindications

Because the actions of this formula in invigorating the blood
and dispelling blood stasis are very strong, it is contraindi-
cated during pregnancy and in most cases that involve exces-
sive menstrual bleeding as well as in the weak or debilitated.
It is also contraindicated in cases with bleeding diathesis or
any active hemorrhagic disorder.

Commentary
Wang Qing-Ren

The early 19th-century physician Wang Qing-Ren was,
without doubt, one of the most innovative physicians in the
history of Chinese medicine. Inquisitive and reflecting the
pervasive critical attitude that Qing-dynasty scholars had de-
veloped regarding the sources of their tradition, Wang Qing-
Ren is widely credited with having reintroduced a focus on
anatomy into medical debates, well before the large-scale
influx of Western medicine into China. Given the legal and
moral context of his time, however, his investigations were
limited to observing the bodies of children who had died in
epidemics and were buried in shallow graves and then dug
up by dogs, of criminals that had been executed, and of dis-
sected animals. This allowed him to criticize the portrayal
of the body as depicted in the Han-dynasty medical classics.
However, his own alternative model was soon after shown to
be equally flawed by Western anatomical texts. Among his
anatomical findings was a pool of blood that was located at
the bottom of the chest and above the diaphragm. He pos-
ited that this is the spot where the essential fluids were trans-
formed into blood, and thus called it the ‘mansion of blood’

(dat xue fit).
Wang’s Approach to Medicine

Wang could not find any anatomical evidence for the con-
nections through which classical texts linked various organ
systems. On the other hand, he felt that the various qi- and
blood-carrying and producing structures that he noted were
clearly interconnected with the organs. Based on this obser-
vation, he posited that deficiency and stagnation of qi and
blood were the underlying causes of all disease:

Making decisions regarding the treatment of disease is rooted
in understanding the qi and blood. Whether one discusses ex-
ternally-contracted [disorders] or [those due to] internal dam-
age, it is essential to establish which of these [two] substances
is damaged in [each] patient at the onset of a disorder. [At the
onset,] what is damaged are not the organs, nor the sinews and
bones, nor the skin and flesh, but in each case the qi and blood.


566 Chapter 13 / Formulas that Regulate the Blood

In line with his emphasis on anatomy, Wang argued that pulse
diagnosis was unreliable and that only those symptoms that
could be directly observed and linked to the distribution of gi
and blood counted as evidence. For blood stasis, for instance,
he listed fifty different symptoms derived from his own clini-
cal experience. Interestingly, he did not include inspection
of the tongue, one of the most commonly used methods
for diagnosing blood stasis today. He furthermore arranged
these symptoms into three primary groups according to the
system in which the blood stasis was mainly located: the ex-
terior (encompassing the head, skin, and blood vessels), the
mansion of blood (the chest above the diaphragm), and the
abdomen (below the diaphragm). For the mansion of blood,
he provided this analysis:

When the blood in the mansion of blood [becomes] static
{and therefore] is no longer vigorous, this is most difficult to
diagnose. Fever in the latter half of the day that becomes more
severe during the first half of the night, abates during the latter
half of the night, and [completely] disappears during the first
half of the day indicates blood stasis in the mansion of blood.
With a milder blood stasis, these four stages are not [clearly]
separated. The [patient becomes] feverish only during the two
periods before and after sunset. If it is even milder, the fever
occurs only during one of these periods. In all cases [of blood
stasis,] I am saying that internal fever is accompanied by a hot
body.

Relationship between the Qi and Blood

Chinese medicine has long understood that any problem af-
fecting the flow of qi will end up affecting the blood and vice
versa, as reflected in the adage, “Blood is the mother of qi,
and qi the commander of blood” (2A A244; KA oe
BY xue wei qi zhi mi; gi wei xue zhi shudi). In the early 17th
century, Wang Ken-Tang wrote in Indispensable Tools for Pat-
tern Treatment that “if you want to adjust the blood, first ad-
just the gi.” About a hundred years later, Wu Cheng wrote in
Collection of Versatility that, “for blood stagnation caused by
qi, first move the qi; for qi stagnation caused by blood stasis,
invigorating the blood is most important.”

Almost all of Wang Qing-Ren’s formulas focus on regulat-
ing the distribution of gi and blood in the body, paying close
attention to the interconnection between the two systems.
Blood stasis, for instance, will invariably lead to stagnation
of qi. Because qi is hot by nature, this is experienced as fever
and body heat. Qi stagnation, likewise, can cause blood stasis.
But in this case, the blood congeals because it does not receive
the warmth of the qi. These insights are clearly reflected in
Wang Qing-Ren’s formulas for treating blood stasis. All of
them move the qi as well as invigorate the blood. But in each
case, the nature of the pathology is responded to by carefully
adjusting both the nature and the dosage of the various herbs
that act on the qi and blood. Drive Out Stasis from the Man-
sion of Blood Decoction (xue fu zhti ya tang), for instance,

treats blood stasis that leads to qi stagnation. It thus uses a
large dosage of blood-invigorating, nourishing, and cooling
herbs and a relatively small dosage of herbs that facilitate the
qi dynamic and are cooling or neutral in temperature. Drive
Out Stasis from the Lower Abdomen Decoction (shao fu zhi
yit tang), one of the associated formulas described below and
designed to treat blood stasis caused by cold, facilitates the
movement of gi with acrid and warming herbs.

Modern Usage

Modern physicians value the clinical experience embodied
in Wang Qing-Ren’s formulas, but reject the anatomical con-
jectures on which they are based. This has led to the curious
situation where, in order to explain the effectiveness of this
formula, some contemporary commentators have gone back
to Chapter 17 of Basic Questions where the (blood) vessels
are defined as mansions of the blood. This allows them to
argue that this formula unblocks the blood vessels. However,
in doing so, they disregard the fact that Wang Qing-Ren cat-
egorically stated that “The blood vessels are not the mansion
of blood.”

At present, this formula is most commonly used to treat
chest pain due to blood stasis, which is accompanied by a
dark red tongue and a choppy or wiry, tight pulse. It is also
used for problems of blood stasis in children, usually when
fever, pain, and difficulty in sleeping develop after trauma.
It is indicated for literally dozens of disorders that can be
attributed to blood stasis in the vessels. In addition to the
characteristic pain and tongue and pulse signs described
above, other guidelines for its use include that the condition
be chronic and accompanied by heat in the palms and soles
due to long-term stasis transforming into heat. Furthermore,
the skin is usually dry or even scaly.
