: Actions Disseminates Lung qi, clears heat, and unblocks the
orifices (specifically the nose)

Indications

Nasal polyps, nasal congestion, atrophic rhinitis, sinusitis,
and allergic rhinitis.

This formula treats the failure of the Lungs to disseminate
the qi along with accumulation of Lung heat when these re-
sult in nasal congestion or nasal polyps. The patient will often
present with a rapid pulse and a red tongue with a white or
yellow coating.

Analysis of Formula

Magnoliae Flos (xin yi), which disperses wind and unblocks
the nose, serves as the chief herb in the formula. Scutellariae
Radix (hudng gin), Gardeniae Fructus (zhi zi), Anemarrhenae
Rhizoma (zhi mi), and Gypsum fibrosum (shf geo) clear heat
and resolve toxicity. Ophiopogonis Radix (mai men dong)
works with Lilii Bulbus (bdi he) to enrich the yin and moisten
the Lungs so as to offset damage to the Lung yin caused by
the drying herbs in the formula and the stagnant heat inher-
ent in this disorder. These herbs serve as deputies by address-
ing the heat congestion that is at the heart of this pattern.

The assistant herbs concentrate on assisting the chief in-
gredient in unblocking the nose by diffusing the Lung gi and
directing it downward. Eriobotryae Folium (pi pd ye) clari-
fies and descends, thus directing the Lung gi downward and
helping the Lung disseminate the qi. Cimicifugae Rhizoma
(sheng md) raises the clear yang and clears heat and resolves
toxicity. This combination of Eriobotryae Folium (pi pd ye)
and Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng md) regulates the flow of
qi in the upper body so that the turbid qi descends and the
clear qi rises.

Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo) serves as envoy by harmo-
nizing the formula, clearing heat, and resolving toxicity. In
sum, the formula clears the heat from constrained stagnation,
disseminates the Lung qi, and unblocks the nose.

Commentary

This formula is derived from the section on the treatment
of nasal piles (4 4 bi zhi) in Orthodox Lineage of External
Medicine. Here ‘piles’ refers to growths in the nose equivalent
to what Western medicine calls nasal polyps. According to the

text, nasal piles form because the “Lung qi is not clear [lead-
ing to] constrained stagnation of wind and dampness.”

This is a concise way of saying that, because the Lung qi
is not flowing freely to the nose, wind and dampness are not
properly dispelled and dispersed and thus stagnate in the
nose. If this is allowed to continue, the pile grows larger and
larger until it completely blocks the nasal passage. Golden
Mirror of the Medical Tradition cites the same formula for the
treatment of this disorder and adds that, over time, the pile
will turn purple and hard.

The source text says that when this formula is combined
with the local application of a powder called Sal Ammoniac
Powder (ndo shd sdn)* the nasal pile will gradually shrink.
Due to the toxicity of two of the ingredients in this powder,
Realgar (xieng hudng) and Calomelas (qing fen), it cannot be
used in the modern Western clinic. This may explain why the
main use of Magnolia Flower Drink to Clear the Lungs (xin yi
ging fei yin) at present is in the treatment of other outcomes
of the failure of the Lung qi to disseminate and the ensuing
stagnation of wind, dampness, and heat: mostly chronic rhi-
nitis, nasal congestion, sinusitis, and allergic rhinitis. While
surgery is the treatment of choice for most nasal polyps, this
formula can be used postoperatively to prevent recurrence.

Because this formula disseminates the Lung qi and clears
heat, with the addition of cough-relieving agents, it is also
suitable for the treatment of Lung-heat cough with yellow
phlegm. This is particularly true if the Lung-heat pattern in-
cludes nasal congestion. It should be noted, however, that
Magnolia Flower Drink to Clear the Lungs (xin yf qing fei
yin) has little capacity to release pathogens from the body’s
exterior, so it would be inappropriate if the Lung heat is part
of a respiratory disorder that includes signs such as aversion
to wind and cold and a floating pulse. Also, despite the in-
clusion of such yin-tonifying agents as Ophiopogonis Radix
(mai men dong) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mi), the
formula is nevertheless drying and should therefore be used
with caution in patients who exhibit signs of yin or fluid de-
ficiency.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
nasal polyps, sinusitis, rhinitis, atrophic rhinitis or allergic
rhinitis. With modifications, it can also treat chronic cough
or bronchitis.

Modifications

Golden Mirror of the Medical Tradition suggests adding
Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qidng hud), Forsythiae
Fructus (lidn qido), and Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bd
he). This increases the formulas ability to dispel dampness,
disseminate the Lung qi, and unblock the nose.

For chronic rhinitis, add Paeoniae Radix rubra (chi shdo)
and Puerariae Radix (ge gen).

e

For Lung-heat cough, add Peucedani Radix (qidn hu), Be-
nincasae Semen (d6ng gua zi), and Mori Cortex (sang bdi

This formula is also called Drain the Spleen Powder (xie pf san),
which refers to its action in draining fire from the Spleen and

Stomach. Yellow refers to the Spleen and Stomach’s correspon-
& dence to the earth phase and to the color yellow.

§ Actions Clears lurking fire from the Spleen and Stomach

Indications

Mouth ulcers, bad breath, thirst, frequent hunger, dry mouth
and lips, a red tongue, and a rapid pulse. Also for tongue
thrusting in children.

This is lurking fire in the Spleen. The Spleen ‘opens through
the mouth, thus Spleen fire is manifested in oral symptoms.
Heat readily transfers from the Spleen to the Stomach (its
paired organ), which leads to thirst and frequent hunger. Heat
in the Spleen can also cause the tongue to become hot, dry,
and red. A red tongue and a rapid pulse are signs of heat. The
tongue is regarded as the ‘sprout’ of the Heart. Why then is
tongue thrusting regarded as a sign of Spleen dysfunction? A
branch of the Spleen channel reaches the root of the tongue
and spreads through its underside. When heat disrupts the
function of the channel, it stimulates the tongue and causes
it to thrust outward. Heat in the Spleen may also cause the
tongue to become hot and dry. It may then thrust out of the
mouth in an effort to cool and moisten itself.

Analysis of Formula

This formula employs a strategy of clearing and dispersing
to drain lurking fire from the Spleen and Stomach. Gypsum
fibrosum (shi gdo), one of the chief ingredients, is acrid and
cooling and is one of the principal herbs for clearing heat
from the middle burner. Gardeniae Fructus (zhi zi), the other
chief ingredient, drains heat from all three burners through
the urine and enters the Heart to relieve irritability. Although
these are the chief ingredients, their dosage is relatively small.
This is to prevent their cooling and descending actions from
further constraining or bottling-up the lurking fire. The large
dosage of Saposhnikoviae Radix (fdng feng), one of the depu-
ties, disperses the lurking Spleen fire in accordance with the
principle of treating constrained fire by dispersal. If the con-
dition is treated simply as a case of Stomach fire to be cleared
and drained, and the dispersing action of this herb is omitted,
there will be no improvement. Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang
feng) also supports the physiological ascending function of
the Spleen yang. Acting in concert, these three ingredients
thus drain fire without injuring the Spleen and Stomach yang,
and disperse constraint without fanning pathological fire.

The second deputy, Pogostemonis/Agastaches Folium
(hud xiang ye), aromatically revives the Spleen. Working to-
gether with Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng), it restores the
qi mechanisms of the Spleen and Stomach and assists in dis-
persing the lurking fire. Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan ceo), honey,
and the wine serve as assistants and envoys. Together they
regulate the middle burner, drain fire, and harmonize the ac-
tions of the other ingredients in the formula.

Cautions and Contraindications

Contraindicated in cases with Stomach yin deficiency and
tongue thrusting due to congenital qi deficiency.

Commentary

The composition of this formula provides an insight to the
proper treatment of lurking heat (fire). Cold substances that
drain heat from the middle burner play a very small role.
What is needed are substances that gently clear and disperse,
as recommended by the Qing-dynasty physician Wang Xu-
Gao: “It is appropriate to drain lurking fire in the Spleen and
Stomach very gently, unlike fire from excess that [needs] to
be drained urgently.” This is another example of flexibly ap-
plying the adage from the Inner Classic, “For fire from con-
straint, discharge it” (X #8 %Z hud yi fa zhi).

Nevertheless, the role of Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang
feng) in the formula has been disputed. The early modern
physician Zhang Shan-Lei, in particular, considered its in-
clusion, especially in such a high dosage, to be a mistake.
He argued that it fans rather than disperses fire and should
therefore be omitted. To settle this question, researchers at the
Nanjing College of Chinese Medicine examined the functions


Formulas that Clear Heat from the Organs 197

of Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng) by means of animal ex-
periments. They found that while the herb does not have
any anti-inflammatory action when used on its own, such an
effect can be produced by combining it with the other herbs
in the formula. They also found that an 80 percent reduction
in the dosage of Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng) did not
markedly influence this action. For mouth ulcers or tongue
thrusting, the dosage of Saposhnikoviae Radix (fdng feng) is
therefore often reduced today and other herbs that clear heat
are added.

The large dosage of Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo) has
likewise given rise to discussion, as its warming and cloying
nature can be thought to inhibit the discharging effect of
Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng). However, used in its un-
prepared form it actually drains fire, as elaborated in Trans-
forming the Significance of Medicinal Substances: “Used un-
prepared, it is cooling and drains fire: it primarily disperses
pathogens in the exterior, reduces swollen sores, eases sore
throats, resolves the toxicity of all herbs, eliminates accumu-
lated fire in the Stomach, and dispels urinary tract pain—this
is the power of sweet coolness eliminating heat.’ This is its
usage here.

This formula is also used in treating yellowing of the
sclera due to Spleen heat.

Comparison
> Vs. CLEAR THE STOMACH PowDeEr (ging wei sdn)

Both formulas treat excess fire in the Spleen and Stomach
manifesting with symptoms in the face and mouth. Clear the
Stomach Powder (qing wei sden) focuses on resolving toxic-
ity and clearing fire caused by damp-heat in the Stomach
that penetrates into the blood. For this reason, the formula
combines bitter, cold Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn) with
herbs that cool the blood, while Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng
md) guides the formula to the collaterals of the Stomach in
the gums. The present formula focuses on draining lurking
heat in the Spleen and Stomach that constrains their yang qi.
Therefore, it pairs cold substances that clear the qi with warm
and acrid herbs that facilitate the qi dynamic of the middle
burner, but avoids bitter and cold herbs like Coptidis Rhi-
zoma (hudng lidn). This reasoning is summarized by Wang
Xu-Gao, who makes a further useful comparison:

Why [does the author of this formula] not use Coptidis Rhi-
zoma (hudng lidn) for lurking heat in the Spleen? Wu He-Gao
says this is because he fears its drying action. This is not the
case. It is because he fears its hindering [of the qi dynamic
that would further trap the lurking heat]. White Tiger Decoc-
tion (bdi hu tang) treats flaring fire of the Lungs and Stomach
that manifests with strong fever, irritability, thirst, and sweat-
ing. This formula treats constrained and steaming fire of the
Stomach and Spleen that manifests with heat in the muscles and
flesh, irritability, and thirst but no sweating. Therefore, it adds
Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng) and Herba Agastaches seu

Pogostemi (hud xidng), grasping the meaning [of the principle]
that one should disperse fire from constraint.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
apthous ulcers and oral thrush.

Actions Drains Stomach fire, cools the blood, and nourishes
the yin

Indications

Toothache (especially when the pain extends into the head),
facial swelling, fever, bad breath, a dry mouth, a red tongue
with little coating, and a slippery, large, and rapid pulse. Also
indicated for bleeding and sores of the gums, and for a swol-
len, painful tongue, lips, or jaw. The painful areas respond
favorably to cold, and worsen with heat.

This is heat accumulation in the Stomach. The yang
brightness Stomach channel, which contains an abundance
of qi and blood, is a common place for conditions of excess
to develop. This channel, and the yang brightness Large Intes-
tine channel, supply the mouth and teeth. The accumulation
of heat blocks the flow of qi in the channel and gives rise to


192 Chapter 4 / Formulas that Clear Heat

rebellious fire, which causes toothache and headache. Fire
also causes the flesh to fester, which manifests as sores and
swelling in the mouth and bad breath. Bleeding of the gums
is caused by fire that has injured the blood vessels. The sen-
sitivity to changes in temperature, the red tongue with little
coating, and the slippery, large, and rapid pulse are all signs of
heat in the Stomach.

Analysis of Formula

The chief herb, Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lian), attacks the
Stomach fire and drains the accumulation of heat. When heat
accumulates in the middle burner, the pure products of di-
gestion are unable to rise and the turbid products are unable
to descend. The deputy, Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng md),
raises and disperses the heat and resolves toxicity. Discussion
of Medicinal Properties lists it as a specific herb for toothache,
ulcers, and festering sores in the mouth. Its synergy with
Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn) ensures that draining of fire
does not harm the qi dynamic, and that the ascent of yang
does not further fan the rising fire. Cimicifugae Rhizoma
(sheng md) also serves as the envoy, which directs the focus
of the formula to the face and mouth. The remaining ingre-
dients are regarded as assistants. Moutan Cortex (mu dan pt)
and Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di hudng) cool the blood and
nourish the yin. Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui) reduces
swelling and alleviates pain by harmonizing the blood.

Cautions and Contraindications

Contraindicated in cases with toothache due to wind-cold, or
tooth and gum problems due to Kidney deficiency.

Commentary

The source text notes that the cause of this disorder is the im-
proper use of hot, tonic herbs. At present, the accumulation
of heat in the Stomach is usually attributed to overconsump-
tion of rich or fried foods, or (paradoxically) of cold foods,
which constrains the yang qi and causes its transformation
into fire.

This is a very effective formula in the treatment of tooth-
ache, swollen gums, and bleeding of the gums due to Stom-
ach fire; it can be modified for treating many types of oral
problems. While all commentators agree on these indications,
they differ in their perspectives on the chief herb and, by
implication, the precise disease dynamic that this formula
treats. Modern textbooks generally follow the Qing-dynasty
scholar Wang Ang in defining Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn)
to be the chief herb. They give two apparently compelling
reasons. First, Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn) is the herb with
the closest affinity to the Stomach, which is the root of the
disorder. Second, the source text itself emphasizes the role of
Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn) as the chief herb by providing
detailed instructions regarding adjustment of its dosage.

Other physicians have expressed divergent views. The
late-Qing dynasty physician Tang Zong- Hai, for instance, em-
phasized the importance of Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng md)
as representing the dispersing method by which the formula
eliminates heat in accordance with the principle that fire from
constraint should be discharged. His contemporary, Luo Mei,
pointed to the absence in the list of indications of signs or
symptoms that are usually associated with yang brightness
channel disorders. For this reason, he considered the root of
the disorder to be heat in the blood and accordingly desig-
nated Radix Rehmanniae Glutinosae (sheng di hudng) as the
chief herb.

Read together, these different perspectives lead to a
deeper understanding of the disease process treated by this
formula. As Ye Tian-Shi noted, “The gums are the collater-
als of the Stomach.” The collaterals pertain to blood, while
signs and symptoms of the disorder imply the presence of
fire toxin. Such toxin readily enters the blood in the Stomach
via food, drink, or, as the source text notes, the improper use
of medication. If blood is deficient, it will readily generate
wind, which in turn leads fire toxin upward into the collater-
als where it manifests as toothache and a progressive ulcer-
ation of the gums. To address all aspects of this pathoglogy,
the formula combines herbs that drain damp-heat from the
Stomach, nourish and cool the blood, and disperse constraint
and relieve toxic heat within the collaterals.
