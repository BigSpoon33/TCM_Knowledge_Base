Formulas that Promote the Movement of Qi 523

Analysis of Formula

Constraint of Liver qi transforming into fire should be treat-
ed by a strategy of dredging and regulating the Liver qi, sup-
ported by invigorating the blood. This strategy is consistent
with the nature and function of the Liver, as well as with the
relationship between the qi and blood. Because qi is the com-
mander of blood, its constraint invariably impedes the flow
of blood. Bitter and cooling Toosendan Fructus (chudn lian
zi), the chief herb, enters the Liver, Stomach, and Small Intes-
tine channels. It clears heat from the chest, hypochondrium,
and groin by draining it through the urine. When the heat
has been drained, and the fire constraint resolved, the Liver qi
can once again carry out its regulating function. Bitter, acrid,
and warming Corydalis Rhizoma (ydn hu sud) invigorates
the blood by moving the qi. Li Shi-Zhen praised its actions in
Comprehensive Outline of the Materia Medica, noting that “it
is able to move qi stagnation of the blood and blood stagna-
tion within the qi. Therefore, it specifically focuses on pain
throughout the entire body, both above and below. Hitting
the mark by using [this herb] is so sublime that it cannot be
expressed in words.” Acting as both assistant and envoy, it
thus reinforces the actions of the chief herb.

Cautions and Contraindications

Use with caution during pregnancy. This formula is inappro-
priate for pain from Liver qi constraint in the context of cold
conditions.

Commentary

The formula’s original indications were “heat inversion Heart
pain (FAK SA re jue xin tong) that is intermittent [in char-
acter| and has become chronic.” As such, it can be viewed as
an alternative to the treatment strategies for heart pain pro-
vided in Essential Formulas from the Golden Cabinet, which
focus on cold. Various commentators have interpreted ‘Heart’
here in both the narrow sense (i. e., referring to the heart
organ), and in the wider sense (i.e., as a body region that en-
compasses the chest, but also the Stomach). ‘Inversion’ refers
to a sudden upward-rushing of qi. In the present case, this is
hot or yang qi rushing upward from the Liver channel into
a body region where it does not belong and where it thus
constitutes an excess. The intermittent character of the pain
indicates that it is a manifestation of gi stagnation, while the
fact that it has become chronic implies that this stagnation
has also affected the blood. This explains the specific com-
bination of herbs in this formula. Toosendan Fructus (chuan
lian zi) was used by Jin-dynasty physicians such as Zhang
Yuan-Su as a specific herb for “heat inversion Heart pain,’
while Corydalis Rhizoma (ydn hu sud) is listed in the earlier
Grandfather Lei’s Discussion of Herb Preparation as treating
“unbearable Heart pain.’ In Six Texts Summarizing the Medi-
cine of Xu Ling-Tai, the Qing-dynasty commentator Xu Da-
Chun provides the following explanation:

When heat lurks in the terminal yin, wood and fire qi are con-
strained and the yang [of these channels no longer] extends, so
there is heat inversion Heart pain that comes and goes irregu-
larly, Toosendan Fructus (chudan lian zi) specifically enters the
terminal yin and transforms lurking heat in order to eliminate
dampness. Corydalis Rhizoma (ydn hu sud) specifically acts on
the blood aspect, invigorating the blood vessels by regulating
the blood.

Xu Da-Chun’s analysis emphasizes the ability of Toosendan
Fructus (chudn lian zi) to guide out excess fire via the urine,
This is a very different approach to resolving qi constraint
than the use of acrid, warming herbs that move the qi. For
this reason, the formula became extremely popular among
Qing-dynasty physicians like Ye Tian-Shi, who were search-
ing for a strategy to treat Liver qi constraint for a southern
Chinese clientele whom they considered to be prone to defi-
ciency of yin and excess of yang. Averse to the use of bitter,
drying herbs that would further damage the yin as well as to
the use of exterior-resolving herbs like Bupleuri Radix (chdi
hui) that might further facilitate the rising of yang and gen-
eration of wind, Melia Toosendan Powder (jin ling zi san)
offered an excellent alternative. Zhang Lu, another Qing-
dynasty physician, argued that this formula was at least as
effective as Sudden Smile Powder (shi xido sdn)—another
frequently used formula for the treatment of Stomach and
Heart pain—without the inconvenience of its foulness and
bad smell.

Given the enormous influence of these physicians, Melia
Toosendan Powder (jin ling zi sen) thus became the formula
of choice for treating Liver qi constraint due to excess minis-
terial fire, especially where this was combined with a tenden-
cy to yin deficiency. Its range of application was also extended
to other types of pain associated with the Liver channel, such
as bulging qi, menstrual pain, and urinary obstruction in
children, as well as to disorders of the yin and yang Linking
vessels, by Shen Jin-Ao in Wondrous Lantern for Peering into
the Origin and Development of Miscellaneous Diseases. Some
modern writers, like Chen Chao-Zu in Treatment Strategies
and Formulas in Chinese Medicine, even go as far as recom-
mending it for all types of pain, irrespective of location or
causation. This attitude is summarized in Selected Annota-
tions to Ancient Formulas from the Garden of Crimson Snow:
“Although this is a small formula, its synergism is divine. It
has the power to effect cures without a hitch. Do not disre-
gard it as being bland.”

In contemporary usage, the pain-relieving properties of
this formula are employed whenever Liver constraint turns
into fire. This includes conditions such as gall stones or kid-
ney stones, characterized by severe pain, obstruction, and
inflammation.

This formula is often attributed to Collection of Writings
on the Mechanisms of Illness, Suitability of Qi, and the Safe-
guarding of Life as Discussed in the Basic Questions. Although


524 Chapter 12 / Formulas that Regulate the Qi

this is the oldest extant texts listing this formula, Pocket Pre-
scriptions states that the formula was previously published in
Formulary of the Pharmacy Service for Benefiting the People
in the Taiping Era. Even if the current version of the latter
text no longer lists the formula, one must assume that it was
deleted in the course of transmission. Hence, it still should be
regarded as the source text.

Comparisons
> Vs. LerT METAL PILL (zud jin wan)

Left Metal Pill (zue jin wdn) is used for Liver fire that attacks
the Stomach. This disrupts the descending function of the
Stomach, which manifests as vomiting or belching of sour
fluids. The Stomach is thus the location of this pathology and
the target of the formula. Melia Toosendan Powder (jin ling
zi sdn), on the other hand, is indicated for fire constraint that
affects the qi dynamic and secondarily leads to blood stasis. It
targets the qi and the blood rather than a specific organ.

> Vs. AUGMENTED RAMBLING Pownker (id wei xiao ydo
san)

Both of these formulas can be used to treat Liver qi constraint
transforming into fire. However, Augmented Rambling Pow-
der (ji wei xido ydo sdn) is better suited for patients where
such constraint is due to gi and blood deficiency. By contrast,
Melia Toosendan Powder (jin ling zi san) is primarily indicat-
ed for excess fire causing constraint, particularly where this
occurs against a background of constitutional yin deficiency.
Linking Decoction (yi gudn jidn), discussed in Chapter 8, is
thus a natural extension of this formula.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
peptic ulcer, chronic gastritis, hepatitis, and cholecystitis.

= Actions Promotes the movement of qi, directs rebellious qi
2 downward, expands the chest, and dissipates clumping

Indications

An irritable, stifling sensation in the chest and diaphragm
together with labored breathing, wheezing, epigastric focal
distention and fullness, and a loss of appetite. The tongue
coating is often white and the pulse is wiry.

This is qi excess in the upper burner due to stagnation of
the qi dynamic, which thereupon loses its ability to ascend
and descend, leading to rebellion and clumping of gi, espe-
cially in the upper and middle burners. Causation is attrib-
uted to emotional disorders, in particular to excessive pen-
siveness, anger, worry, and/or grief. The Lungs have lost their
ability to direct the qi downward, causing labored breathing
and wheezing. This impacts the ability of the Liver qi to as-
cend, causing it to stagnate, which manifests as an irritable,
stifling sensation in the chest and diaphragm. Rebellious qi
also impairs the Stomach’s harmony and descending func-
tion, leading to epigastric focal distention and a loss of appe-
tite. The white tongue coating is indicative of cold, suggesting
that this condition does not occur in patients with yang qi
excess. The wiry pulse reflects qi stagnation.

Analysis of Formula

This formula treats severe qi stagnation that has led to re-
bellion and clumping. Besides moving the gi to unblock the
stagnation, it also directs the qi downward, expands the chest,
and dissipates clumping. The chief herb is acrid, warming,
and penetrating Linderae Radix (wii yao). Although it has a
particular affinity for the lower burner, it is said to enter all
twelve channels where it promotes both the ascent and de-
scent of qi. Acrid, mobilizing, and dispersing Aquilariae Lig-
num resinatum (chen xidng) acts as deputy. It smoothes the
flow of qi, directing it downward from the Lungs to the Kid-
neys. Working synergistically with the chief herb, this combi-
nation effectively disperses the stagnation that is the root of
this pattern, while also putting down the rebellion that is its
branch. Acrid, warming, and draining Arecae Semen (bing
ldng) serves as the first assistant. [t strongly promotes the
downward movement of gi, breaks up stagnation and clump-
ing, and thereby eliminates the irritable, stifling, and full sen-
sations. Strong, acrid dispersion and breaking up of stagna-
tion can readily injure the qi and damage the fluids. For this
reason, sweet and tonifying Ginseng Radix (ren shen), which
augments the source qi but also enriches the fluids, is added
as the second assistant. No specific envoy is needed because
the qi-regulating herbs all act on the qi dynamic—the main
target of this formula—with the downward-directing of the
rebellion clearly being more important than the upward-di-
recting of gi from below.

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula is designed for treating an acute condition, and
should therefore not be taken long-term. It is also inappropri-
ate for patients who have significant deficiency of normal qi,
reflected in part by fatigue and a frail pulse.

Commentary

This is another formula for the treatment of qi stagnation
caused by emotional excess. Although some texts include it
in the category of formulas that direct rebellious qi down-
ward, its primary function is that of regulating a disordered
qi dynamic.

Primary Organs Involved

Modern textbooks invariably link the etiology and pathody-
namic of the pattern for which this formula is indicated to
Liver qi stagnation. The modern physician Qin Bo-Wei, a ma-
jor force in the systematization of Chinese medicine in con-
temporary China, likewise noted in [Qin] Qian-Zhai’s Lecture
Notes on Medicine that it “governs the treatment of Liver qi re-
belling horizontally, invading the Lungs above and the Spleen
and Stomach to the sides.” Most premodern writers focus in-
stead on the qi circulation between the Lungs and Kidneys.
The Qing-dynasty writer Wang You- Yuan is typical:


526 Chapter 12 / Formulas that Regulate the Qi

Breathing out is yang, breathing in is yin. If the Lung yang is
flourishing, it clears and clarifies by moving [qi] downward,
returning it to the Kidney yin. When the qi is thus received and
contained it is not pathologically dispersed nor does it rebel. If
the normal qi is debilitated, pathogenic qi invariably becomes
overabundant. If one is firm [in forcing the patient] to get

rid of [their addictions] to sensual pleasure and a debauched
lifestyle while breaking up stagnation, the pathogenic qi is
unable to lurk. The formula uses Ginseng Radix (ren shen) to
tonify the normal qi and Aquilariae Lignum resinatum (chen
xidng) for it to be grasped in the Kidneys. [Once this has been
accomplished] one can then use Arecae Semen (bing lang) and
Linderae Radix (wi yao) to guide out [the rebellious pathogen-
ic qi] in accordance [with the manifestations]. This is what is
meant by needing to guard against deficiency in cases of excess,
and first tonifying if one wishes to drain.

The four herbs [in this formula] all have a thick flavor.
Grinding them [into a fine powder allows] these flavors to be
fully released. Boiling [the powder allows] the extending [ac-
tion] of their qi [also] to be released. [Their] flavor and qi thus
both available, the [formula’s] effects are achieved in perfect
coordination. Taking [the powder] together with Special Pill
to Nourish the Normal Qi ( # iE 4 ydng zheng dan) is an even
more excellent [way of administering it].

The original formula tonifies the Lung qi to nourish the
normal [qi] and warms the Kidney qi [so that when the qi]
is pressed down, it can be contained and returned to its root.
Acute wheezing is thus quickly [brought under control].

Wang's explanation appears to be quite apt, especially as none
of the herbs used in the formula have a specific affinity to the
Liver, whereas Aquilariae Lignum resinatum (chen xidng)—
considered by some commentators, including Qin Bo- Wei, to
be the chief ingredient—is a specific herb for guiding qi into
the Kidneys and the gate of vitality. This explanation is also
consistent with the intentions of the source text, which relates
its use to Special Pill to Nourish the Normal Qi (yang zheng
dan). Two formulas by this name are listed in the pre-Song
formularies and would have been available to the author of
Formulas to Aid the Living. Both contain warming minerals
such as Sulfur (lit hudng) and have the function of assisting
the yang in order to disperse cold. This has led the modern
scholar Fan Qiao-Ling, in her recent book Formulas, to con-
clude that Yan Yong-He composed this formula to treat rebel-
lion caused by severe qi stagnation arising from cold from
deficiency.

Role of Ginseng Radix (ren shen)

The analysis presented in Discussion of Blood Patterns by the
early modern physician Tang Zong-Hai reaches the same
conclusion, but by another route:

[This formula] uses Ginseng Radix (ren shen) to enrich the
Lungs by way of tonifying the qi of the mother [i.e., earth]. It
uses Aquilariae Lignum resinatum (chen xiang), which enters
the Kidneys, in order to grasp the qi at its root. Only then
does it employ Arecae Semen (bing lang) and Linderae Radix
(wii yao) to treat the branch. Draining excess and tonifying

deficiency truly is a sublime method for regulating the grasping
of rebellious qi. The Lungs are yang. But their capacity for ac-
cepting the qi and moving it downward depends entirely on the
yin fluids. Therefore, {the formula] employs Ginseng Radix (ren
shen) in order to generate fluids. The Kidneys are yin. But their
capacity for transforming qi and moving it upward depends
entirely on the true yang. Therefore, [the formula] employs Aq-
uilariae Lignum resinatum (chen xidng) in order to secure the
yang. As it sinks deeply into the water, it is able to truly grasp
the yang within the water.

The analyses of the commentators cited here suggest that the
primary function of Ginseng Radix (ren shen) in this formula
is not to balance the harsh drying effects of the qi-moving
ingredients, but to tonify a deficiency of qi that lurks in the
background of the pattern. In Convenient Reader of Estab-
lished Formulas, the Qing-dynasty physician Zhang Bing-
Chen suggests replacing Ginseng Radix (ren shen) with Au-
rantii Fructus (zhi ke) if such a deficiency does not exist. A
number of other physicians made similar substitutions, creat-
ing new formulas that have also become widely used. Some of
these are listed under ASSOCIATED FORMULAS below.

In Comprehensive Medicine According to Master Zhang,
the Qing-dynasty writer Zhang Lu notes that, following ad-
ministration of this formula, bubbles should appear in the
stool. This indicates that the gi excess is being eliminated,
whereupon the chest symptoms should ease.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders includ-
ing bronchial asthma, emphysema, gastritis, and postsurgical
adhesions.
