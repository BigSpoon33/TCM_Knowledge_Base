## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and circulation-improving effects. Wu Ling Zhi contains resin acids that strongly activate blood circulation. Multiple blood-moving herbs work synergistically to break up stagnation. Studies demonstrate efficacy in gynecological conditions and chronic pain.

### Clinical Experience
Powerful formula for stubborn gynecological conditions with blood stasis. Particularly effective for women with chronic pelvic pain, irregular periods, and palpable masses. Often used long-term for conditions like endometriosis and fibroids. Requires constitutional assessment before use.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Wrap Wu Ling Zhi in cloth when decocting to prevent residue
**Timing**: Between meals, can start after menstruation ends
**Duration**: 3-6 months for chronic conditions, monitor progress regularly
