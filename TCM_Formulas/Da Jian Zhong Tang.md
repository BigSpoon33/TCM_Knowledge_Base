566 Chapter 13 / Formulas that Regulate the Blood

In line with his emphasis on anatomy, Wang argued that pulse
diagnosis was unreliable and that only those symptoms that
could be directly observed and linked to the distribution of gi
and blood counted as evidence. For blood stasis, for instance,
he listed fifty different symptoms derived from his own clini-
cal experience. Interestingly, he did not include inspection
of the tongue, one of the most commonly used methods
for diagnosing blood stasis today. He furthermore arranged
these symptoms into three primary groups according to the
system in which the blood stasis was mainly located: the ex-
terior (encompassing the head, skin, and blood vessels), the
mansion of blood (the chest above the diaphragm), and the
abdomen (below the diaphragm). For the mansion of blood,
he provided this analysis:

When the blood in the mansion of blood [becomes] static
{and therefore] is no longer vigorous, this is most difficult to
diagnose. Fever in the latter half of the day that becomes more
severe during the first half of the night, abates during the latter
half of the night, and [completely] disappears during the first
half of the day indicates blood stasis in the mansion of blood.
With a milder blood stasis, these four stages are not [clearly]
separated. The [patient becomes] feverish only during the two
periods before and after sunset. If it is even milder, the fever
occurs only during one of these periods. In all cases [of blood
stasis,] I am saying that internal fever is accompanied by a hot
body.

Relationship between the Qi and Blood

Chinese medicine has long understood that any problem af-
fecting the flow of qi will end up affecting the blood and vice
versa, as reflected in the adage, “Blood is the mother of qi,
and qi the commander of blood” (2A A244; KA oe
BY xue wei qi zhi mi; gi wei xue zhi shudi). In the early 17th
century, Wang Ken-Tang wrote in Indispensable Tools for Pat-
tern Treatment that “if you want to adjust the blood, first ad-
just the gi.” About a hundred years later, Wu Cheng wrote in
Collection of Versatility that, “for blood stagnation caused by
qi, first move the qi; for qi stagnation caused by blood stasis,
invigorating the blood is most important.”

Almost all of Wang Qing-Ren’s formulas focus on regulat-
ing the distribution of gi and blood in the body, paying close
attention to the interconnection between the two systems.
Blood stasis, for instance, will invariably lead to stagnation
of qi. Because qi is hot by nature, this is experienced as fever
and body heat. Qi stagnation, likewise, can cause blood stasis.
But in this case, the blood congeals because it does not receive
the warmth of the qi. These insights are clearly reflected in
Wang Qing-Ren’s formulas for treating blood stasis. All of
them move the qi as well as invigorate the blood. But in each
case, the nature of the pathology is responded to by carefully
adjusting both the nature and the dosage of the various herbs
that act on the qi and blood. Drive Out Stasis from the Man-
sion of Blood Decoction (xue fu zhti ya tang), for instance,

treats blood stasis that leads to qi stagnation. It thus uses a
large dosage of blood-invigorating, nourishing, and cooling
herbs and a relatively small dosage of herbs that facilitate the
qi dynamic and are cooling or neutral in temperature. Drive
Out Stasis from the Lower Abdomen Decoction (shao fu zhi
yit tang), one of the associated formulas described below and
designed to treat blood stasis caused by cold, facilitates the
movement of gi with acrid and warming herbs.

Modern Usage

Modern physicians value the clinical experience embodied
in Wang Qing-Ren’s formulas, but reject the anatomical con-
jectures on which they are based. This has led to the curious
situation where, in order to explain the effectiveness of this
formula, some contemporary commentators have gone back
to Chapter 17 of Basic Questions where the (blood) vessels
are defined as mansions of the blood. This allows them to
argue that this formula unblocks the blood vessels. However,
in doing so, they disregard the fact that Wang Qing-Ren cat-
egorically stated that “The blood vessels are not the mansion
of blood.”

At present, this formula is most commonly used to treat
chest pain due to blood stasis, which is accompanied by a
dark red tongue and a choppy or wiry, tight pulse. It is also
used for problems of blood stasis in children, usually when
fever, pain, and difficulty in sleeping develop after trauma.
It is indicated for literally dozens of disorders that can be
attributed to blood stasis in the vessels. In addition to the
characteristic pain and tongue and pulse signs described
above, other guidelines for its use include that the condition
be chronic and accompanied by heat in the palms and soles
due to long-term stasis transforming into heat. Furthermore,
the skin is usually dry or even scaly.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a wide variety of biomedically-defined disorders.
These can be divided into the following groups:

* Cardiac and vascular disorders including coronary artery
disease, rheumatic valvular heart disease, hypertension,
and cor pulmonale

* Structural disorders of the chest including intercostal neu-
ralgia, costochondritis, and thoracic strains

* Neurological and psychiatric disorders including postcon-
cussion syndrome, migraine, trigeminal neuralgia, depres-
sion, and psychosis.


Formulas that Invigorate the Blood and Dispel Blood Stasis 567

This formula has also been used in the treatment of peri-
menopausal syndrome, primary dysmenorrhea, chronic hep-
atitis, peptic ulcers, and urticaria.

Modifications

° For headache, add Viticis Fructus (man jing zi) and Tribuli
Fructus (ci jf Ii).

¢ For pain in the hypochondria from an enlarged liver, add
Salviae miltiorrhizae Radix (dan shen), Curcumae Radix
(yi jin), Tabanus (meng chdng), and Aspongopus (jiti xiang
cheng).

¢ For immobile subcostal and abdominal masses, add Cur-
cumae Radix (yi: jin) and Salviae miltiorrhizae Radix (dan
shen).

¢ For amenorrhea or dysmenorrhea, remove Platycodi Ra-
dix (jie geng) and add Cyperi Rhizoma (xiang fu), Leonuri
Herba (yi mu cdo), and Lycopi Herba (ze Idn).

¢ For rheumatic valvular heart disease, remove Cyathulae Ra-
dix (chudn nit xi) and Platycodi Radix (jie geng) and add
herbs that support the normal qi as required. For example,
for insomnia or restless sleep, add Ziziphi spinosae Semen
(sudn zdo ren); for gi deficiency, add Codonopsis Radix
(dang shen); for yang deficiency, also remove Bupleuri Ra-
dix (chdi hii) and add Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi
fu zi) and Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui zhi).

* For angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease, increase
the dosage of Carthami Flos (heng hud) and Chuanxiong
Rhizoma (chudn xidng) and add Salviae miltiorrhizae Ra-

Although this formula is commonly interpreted to focus on the
head and face, its author, Wang Qing-Ren, stated that it is able “to
unblock the blood pipes” (3&#2 # tong xue gudn). He also noted
that the bluish blood vessels that become visible on the skin are a
distinguishing sign for blood stasis in the blood pipes. Contempo-
tary commentators such as the Shaanxi College of TCM therefore
interpret the term ‘unblocking the orifices’ (3&8 ® tong qido) to mean
not just the sensory organs of the head, but more generally the small
apertures through which the blood enters and exits as it circulates
through the body.

phragm with palpable abdominal masses accompanied by fixed
pain, or abdominal masses that are visible when lying down. Also
for chronic diarrhea and daybreak diarrhea. Through his anatomi-
cal studies, Wang Qing-Ren discovered that all the organs, with the
exception of the heart and lungs, are located below the diaphragm.
This formula therefore treats blood stasis within these organs. The
most important diagnostic marker are palpable abdominal masses,
although it is important to remember that other pathologies (such
as qi stagnation, phlegm, or dampness) can also cause these masses.
This formula is also commonly used to treat amenorrhea and pain-
ful periods.

Invigorates the blood, dispels blood stasis, warms the menses, and
alleviates pain. For blood stasis accumulating in the lower abdomen
caused by cold characterized by palpable masses that may or may
not be painful, or lower abdominal pain without palpable masses, or
lower abdominal distention, or lower back pain and lower abdomi-
nal distention during menstruation, or frequent menstruation (3-5
times per month) with dark or purple menstrual blood (usually with
clots), or abnormal uterine bleeding accompanied by lower abdomi-
nal soreness and pain.

This formula is basically a combination of Four-Substance Decoc-
tion with Safflower and Peach Pit (tdo heng st wit tang) and Sudden
Smile Powder (shi xiao san). It is particularly indicated for cold from
deficiency leading to blood stasis. Thus, in addition to signs of blood
stasis, there will also be symptoms of cold. These include an aversion
to cold, low or depressed mood, cold extremities, white discharges,
and a pale tongue. Recently, this formula has been successfully used
in the treatment of cirrhosis of the liver with edema with the addi-
tion of Rehmanniae Radix (sheng d} hudng), Cyperi Rhizoma (xiang
fu), Linderae Radix (wii yao), Persicae Semen (tdo ren), Carthami
Flos (hong hud), and Luffae Fructus Retinervus (si gud lud).

Invigorates the blood, promotes the movement of qi, dispels blood
stasis, unblocks the collaterals, unblocks painful obstruction, and al-
leviates pain. For painful obstruction due to the obstruction of qi
and blood in the channels and collaterals with such symptoms as
shoulder pain, arm pain, lower back pain, leg pain, or other chronic
aches and pains of the body. While the principal formula promotes
the movement of gi and especially unblocks the flow in the chest and
hypochondria, this formula works on the entire body, which makes it
particularly useful in treating painful obstruction of the extremities
and joints. The source text notes that this formula is often effective
when conventional formulas for treating painful obstruction have
failed.

Decoction. Invigorates the blood, transforms stasis, regulates the
qi, and transforms phlegm. For qi stagnation and blood stasis com-
plicated by phlegm obstruction manifesting as mania that persists
for an extended period of time, agitation, restlessness, incoherent
speech, and constant anger. If severe, the condition will manifest like
a yang brightness excess pattern with a fondness for climbing up to
high places, singing, and taking off one’s clothes, and a great variety
of other odd and bizarre behaviors. There will also be obvious symp-
toms of blood stasis such as a dark complexion, pain and fullness
of the chest and flanks, headache, palpitations, a purple tongue, or
stasis spots on the tongue body, and a wiry and fine, or a rough and
fine pulse. In contrast to the principal formula, where stasis of blood
constrains the ministerial fire causing symptoms of heat, here the
qi stagnation causes accumulation of fluids, which transform into
phlegm and obstruct the blood.

Actions Tonifies the qi, invigorates the blood, and unblocks the
channels


Formulas that invigorate the Blood and Dispel Blood Stasis 569

Indications

Sequelae of wind-stroke including hemiplegia, paralysis, and
atrophy of the lower limbs, facial paralysis, slurred speech,
drooling, dry stools, urinary frequency or incontinence, a
white tongue coating, and a moderate pulse. The source text
also prescribes the formula for atrophy disorders with the
same underlying mechanism.

This is qi deficiency leading to blood stasis obstructing
the channels. This impairs the movement of qi and the pro-
vision of nourishment by the blood. The sinews, blood ves-
sels, muscles, and flesh are thereby deprived of nourishment,
which manifests as hemiplegia, paralysis, and atrophy of the
lower limbs, and facial paralysis. The deficiency of qi and
stasis of blood likewise deprive the tongue of its nourishment
and strength, which manifests as slurred speech and drooling.
Deficiency of yang qi inhibits the descent of the Stomach qi
and obstructs the gi of the yang organs. This results in the
passage of dry stools because of the extended transit time
through the yang organs and thus the increased absorption of
fluids from the stool. And because it is the transforming func-
tion of qi that stabilizes and retains the fluids, the deficiency
of gi also accounts for the urinary frequency or incontinence.
The white tongue coating and moderate pulse are indicative
of qi deficiency. Atrophy disorder characterized by weakness
or flaccidity of the muscles can be due to the same pathody-
namic.

Analysis of Formula

When qi deficiency is the cause of blood stasis, deficiency
is the root and excess is the branch of the disorder. In such
cases, simply tonifying the qi will not fully eliminate the stasis
of blood. Accordingly, this formula strongly tonifies the qi,
while relying on a smaller dosage of ingredients that invigo-
rate the blood to dispel the stasis in the vessels and collaterals.
This approach eliminates blood stasis without injuring the
normal qi. The chief ingredient is Astragali Radix (hudng qi),
which strongly tonifies the primal qi. The dosage of this herb
is five times as much as that of all the other herbs added to-
gether. This indicates that tonifying the qi is the clear priority
in treating this pattern.

All of the other herbs focus on the blood. Angelicae si-
nensis radicis Cauda (dang gui wei), Chuanxiong Rhizoma
(chudn xieng), and Paeoniae Radix rubra (chi shdo) invigo-
rate the blood and harmonize the nutritive qi. Because they
tonify as well as move, they serve as deputies in the formula.
The assistants, Persicae Semen (tdo ren), Carthami Flos (heng
hua), and Pheretima (di leng), invigorate the blood, dispel
blood stasis, and unblock the channels. Pheretima (di Idng)
is especially useful for unblocking and invigorating the chan-
nels and collaterals. In concert with Astragali Radix (hudng
qi), it moves the qi throughout the body.

Cautions and Contraindications

Because this formula breaks up and eliminates blood stasis, it
is contraindicated immediately after a stroke when the cause
is cerebral hemorrhage. Until the etiology is established and
cerebral hemorrhage has been ruled out, one should refrain
from using this formula.

The contemporary physician Zhang Xi-Chun argues that
the formula should only be used if the pulse is empty and
forceless. It is therefore contraindicated in wind-stroke pa-
tients who have a big and forceful, or firm, wiry, and forceful
pulse, or in cases of yin deficiency and hot blood, or during
pregnancy.

Before using this formula one must be sure that the pa-
tient has regained clear consciousness, the body temperature
is normal, there is no hemorrhage, and the pulse is moderate.
Herbal therapy may be required long-term, as its effects are
generally slow and incremental.

Commentary

This formula is another example of Wang Qing-Ren’s ap-
proach to the treatment of disease based on his revision of
classical anatomy and physiology, discussed above in the
COMMENTARY to Drive Out Stasis from the Mansion of
Blood Decoction (xue fu zhi yit tang). As explained there,
Wang focused on the interaction of qi and blood as the key to
treating any disorder. Tonify the Yang to Restore Five-Tenths
Decoction (bu ydng hudn wii ting) applies this approach to
the treatment of hemiplegia, paralysis, atrophy disorders, and
similar symptoms.

Wang Qing-Ren’s Conception of Hemiplegia
Previous generations of physicians had attributed hemiple-
gia to wind-stroke. This was thought to be caused either by
wind entering into the vessels, collaterals, and ultimately or-
gans from without—the so-called ‘true wind-stroke’ (#L ¥
BA zhen zhong feng)—or by internal wind due to heat, yin
deficiency, Liver yang excess, or similar pathologies, often ac-
companied by phlegm—the so-called ‘wind-type stroke (4
? WA, [ei zhong feng). Wang rejected these ideas as incompat-
ible with his anatomical studies and declared that the treat-
ment strategies derived from them were not very effective
in clinical practice. In his opinion, hemiplegia and paralysis
were due to qi deficiency, which deprived the muscles of the
nourishment from blood: “When the primal qi is deficient,
it no longer reaches into the blood vessels. Without qi, the
blood vessels stop [moving blood, which leads to] stasis.” In
Wang's writings, the primal qi and yang are different terms
used to describe the same substance: “Primal qi is fire, fire is
primal qi. This fire is the source of life in the human body.”
Wang’s anatomical findings convinced him that this qi
was produced in the ‘mansion of gi’ (most likely the greater
omentum) from which it was distributed throughout the body
via the ‘protective qi main pipe’ (#148 # wei zeng gudn). Run-
