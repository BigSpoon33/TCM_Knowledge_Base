### Traditional Understanding
"Zheng Qi" means "rectify the qi" - referring to correcting qi movement that has been disrupted by dampness. Classic formula for summer illnesses where external dampness combines with internal spleen weakness. The aromatic herbs awaken the spleen while releasing the exterior.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows gastroprotective, antiemetic, and immune-modulating effects. Huo Xiang contains volatile oils with antimicrobial and digestive properties. The combination demonstrates benefits for gastrointestinal infections and travel-related illness. Studies support use in acute gastroenteritis and functional digestive disorders.

### Clinical Experience
Essential formula for summer digestive problems and travel-related illness. Particularly effective for people who get sick from air conditioning, travel, or eating unfamiliar foods. Often used preventively during travel or hot weather. Excellent safety profile for acute use.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules 2-3 times daily
**Preparation**: Light decoction to preserve volatile oils, add aromatic herbs last
**Timing**: Every 4-6 hours during acute phase, then twice daily
**Duration**: 3-7 days for acute conditions, 2-4 weeks for chronic digestive issues
