## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
Classic example of "qi is the commander of blood, blood is the mother of qi." The 5:1 ratio (Huang Qi 30g : Dang Gui 6g) demonstrates that qi deficiency is the root cause of blood deficiency. When qi is strong, it can generate and move blood properly. Simple but profound formula based on fundamental TCM physiology.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows hematopoietic, immune-enhancing, and energy-boosting effects. Huang Qi contains polysaccharides that stimulate blood cell production and immune function. Dang Gui provides iron and compounds that support blood formation. Studies demonstrate efficacy in anemia, fatigue, and post-surgical recovery.

### Clinical Experience
Essential formula for chronic fatigue and anemia where qi deficiency is the underlying cause. Particularly effective for women with menstrual irregularities and post-partum weakness. Often used as base formula for more complex blood deficiency conditions. Excellent safety profile for long-term use.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Cook Huang Qi first for 30 minutes, then add Dang Gui
**Timing**: Between meals for best absorption
**Duration**: 2-6 months for chronic conditions, shorter for acute blood loss
