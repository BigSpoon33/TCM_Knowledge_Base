### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows anti-inflammatory, circulation-improving, and hormone-regulating effects. Tao Ren contains amygdalin with anti-inflammatory properties. Hong Hua provides safflower yellow with circulation-promoting effects. Studies show efficacy in dysmenorrhea and endometriosis.

### Clinical Experience
Essential formula for women's reproductive health issues involving both deficiency and stagnation. Often more effective than Si Wu Tang alone for menstrual disorders. Takes 2-3 cycles to see full effects on menstruation.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, can be taken as pills
**Timing**: Throughout menstrual cycle, increase during menstruation
