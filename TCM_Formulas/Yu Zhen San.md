896 Chapter 21 / Formulas for External Application

large number of external applications in use at the time. The
most comprehensive collection of externally-used formulas
was assembled in the 19th-century work, Rhymed Prose on
[Medical] Principles and Applications, by Wu Shi-Ji. Wu, a
member of a family with many generations of physicians,
observed that there were shortcomings to internal herbal
therapy such as the unavailability or expense of certain herbs,
the ineffectiveness of internal treatment for certain disorders,
and patients who were unable to take herbs. He thus dedi-
cated himself to the study of external applications. For over
twenty years, he scoured the classical texts for references to
external applications and also collected folk remedies. His
book is now regarded as the masterpiece on external applica-
tions (9h16 2 5% wai zhi zhi zong).

Modern times have brought many new ingredients,
adjuvants and actives, to the world of external applications.
Steroids, salicylic acid, isopropyl alcohol, petroleum jelly,
DMSO, and glycerin are just a few of the common mod-
ern substances now found in creams, ointments, and other
external applications. New forms, such as lotions and gels,
are also part of the modern evolution. In our discussion, we
will focus on traditional methods and materials, mentioning
modern developments only when they arise in the context
of that discussion. There are many types of external appli-
cations. For a brief discussion, see the Introduction to this
book.

Considerations Regarding the Use of
External Applications

In Rhymed Prose on [Medical] Principles and Applications,
Wu compared the use of external and internal therapies: “The
principles (2 17) of external treatment are the same as those
applied to internal treatment; the herbs used for external
treatment are the same as those used for internal treatment;
the sole difference is method.” This difference in method
requires attention to some aspects of treatment that do not
enter into consideration for internal methods of treatment.
The following guidelines highlight some of the aspects that
require attention and suggest means of ameliorating associ-
ated problems:

1, Apply external applications to a small area first to test for

sensitivity.

Although rare, patients can have reactions or sensitivities
to certain applications. It may be an allergy to a specific
herb or adjuvant, or to the combination. In any case, by
applying a small amount to a sensitive area of the body,
such as the inner surface of the forearm, one can test for
any reaction. It is best to wait a few hours after the test to
make sure the patient does not develop redness, itching,
blisters, or pain.

2. When first applying an external application, do so early in
the day.

If a patient is to have an unfavorable reaction to an appli-
cation, it is best that this happen early in the day so that by
bed time, the irritation does not interfere with sleep.

3. If toxic materials are in the applica
