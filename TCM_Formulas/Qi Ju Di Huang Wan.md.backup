Gou Qi Zi nourishes liver and kidney while benefiting vision, while Ju Hua clears liver heat and brightens eyes. Essential concept: "kidney stores essence which manifests in the eyes."

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects beneficial for retinal health. Gou Qi Zi contains zeaxanthin and other carotenoids that protect the macula. Ju Hua provides anti-inflammatory compounds. Studies demonstrate benefits in age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for age-related eye problems and digital eye strain. Particularly effective for people with dry constitution who develop eye problems with aging. Often used preventively for those at risk of eye disease. Best results when combined with proper eye hygiene and protective measures.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: 6-9g pills twice daily, or decoct above raw herb doses
**Preparation**: Pills preferred for convenience, decoction for acute conditions
**Timing**: Between meals, consistent daily dosing important
**Duration**: 3-6 months minimum for eye conditions, often long-term
