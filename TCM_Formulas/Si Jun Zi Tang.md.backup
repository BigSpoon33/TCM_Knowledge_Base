## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
Foundation formula for all spleen qi deficiency patterns. Represents the "four gentlemen" approach - each herb is mild, harmonious, and supportive rather than aggressive. The perfect balance for building qi without causing stagnation.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows immunomodulating effects, digestive benefits, and anti-fatigue properties. Ren Shen contains ginsenosides that support energy and immune function. Bai Zhu has gastroprotective effects. Fu Ling shows anti-inflammatory properties.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent foundational formula - works best when taken consistently over time. Most patients tolerate it very well. Often serves as a base for more complex formulas. Results typically seen within 2-4 weeks.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, pills excellent for long-term use
**Timing**: Between meals, or 30 minutes before meals to improve appetite
**Duration**: 4-12 weeks for chronic conditions, longer for constitutional support
