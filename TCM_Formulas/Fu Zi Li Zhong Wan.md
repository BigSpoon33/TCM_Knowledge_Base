(er shen wan) is appropriate. In case of Spleen diarrhea with hy-
peractive wood controlling earth, Evodiae Fructus (wii zhi yt)
is able to disperse the qi of the terminal yin. Therefore, it can be
used to curb wood. If that is not the case, then there is noth-

ing better than removing Schisandrae Fructus (wti wei zi) and
Evodiae Fructus (wii zhi yu) and replacing them with Foeniculi
Fructus (xido hui xing) and Aucklandiae Radix (mii xiang).

Halt the Carts Pill

zhi che wan

Within Mahayana Buddhism, the three types of Buddha corre-
spond to different programs of skillful means (upaya) or expedi-
ent practices, Chapter 3 of the Lotus Sutra compares the three
types of Buddha to three carts, namely, a goat cart, a deer cart,
and an ox cart. Some authors in the history of Chinese medicine
took up this idea and linked the three carts to the three burners
when referring to the transformative movement of essence, qi,
and spirit in the body. This formula treats dysenteric disorders
due to problems in the qi dynamic, expressed in terms of the
uncontrolled movement of the three carts, leading to leakage
from the carts.

Indications

Discharge of blood and pus from the bowels (blood and pus
can be mixed up with each other) that comes and goes, te-
nesmus, continuous abdominal pain, irritability of the chest,
a red tongue with little coating, and a thin, rapid pulse.

This is chronic or intermittent dysenteric disorder due
to damp-heat that has not been eliminated and gradually
damages both the yin and yang. Damp-heat that remains in
the Intestines for a long period of time leads to stagnation of
qi and stasis of blood. These various pathogens intermingle,
causing the discharge of blood and pus from the bowels as
well as tenesmus. Chronic or intermittent dysenteric disorders
invariably damage the blood and yin, and, over the long term,
the Spleen yang as well. The former manifests as irritability, a
red tongue with little coating, and a thin and rapid pulse. The
latter manifests as continuous abdominal pain due to failure
of the yang to warm and move the Spleen qi.

Analysis of Formula

The pattern treated by this formula is one of excess compli-
cated by deficiency, where the chronic retention of damp-
heat has led to deficiency of the yang qi and
