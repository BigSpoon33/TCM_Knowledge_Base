der (Taishan pan shi sdn) is appropriate. It has the added
functions of treating inhibited urination during pregnancy,
correcting fetal position in the sixth and seventh months of
pregnancy, and of promoting a smooth delivery when ad-
ministered during the birthing process itself. The difference
between these formulas is indeed subtle and is revealed only
by the degree of restlessness of the fetus and the intensity of
other heat signs such as irritability, a red tongue tip, and a
rapid pulse.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat such biomedically-defined disorders as fetal malposi-
tion, difficult delivery, habitual miscarriage, threatened abor-
tion, and inhibited urination during pregnancy.

Modifications

* For difficult delivery, add Carthami Flos (hong hud).

* For securing the fetus, add Eucommiae Cortex (di: zhong)
and Taxilli Herba (sang ji sheng) and increase the dosage of
Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi shdo).

* To aid the pelvic bones to part during delivery, add Testu-
dinis Plastrum (gui ban), Cyathulae Radix (chudn nit xi),
and Ginseng Radix (ren shen).

* For cases of deficiency, add Ginseng Radix (ren shen).

Actions Tonifies the blood and qi and treats malarial disorders

Indications

Chronic, unrelenting malarial disorders with a wan complex-
ion, emaciation, a pale tongue, and a moderate, large, defi-
cient pulse. The slightest amount of exertion will lead to an
exacerbation of the intermittent fever and chills.

If prolonged and unrelenting, malarial disorders can pro-
foundly affect the qi and blood. This is because such disor-
ders are most closely associated with the Gallbladder channel,
which over time and through its connection with the Liver,

will affect the blood. Liver and Gallbladder disorders have
an adverse influence on the Spleen and Stomach (the trans-
formational source of qi and blood), which leads to qi and
blood deficiency. A wan complexion, emaciation, pale tongue,
and large, deficient pulse are typical manifestations of qi and
blood deficiency. As in most conditions of deficiency, slight
exertion will aggravate the symptoms.
