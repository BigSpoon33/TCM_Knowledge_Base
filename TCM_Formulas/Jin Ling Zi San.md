Formulas that Promote the Movement of Qi 523

Analysis of Formula

Constraint of Liver qi transforming into fire should be treat-
ed by a strategy of dredging and regulating the Liver qi, sup-
ported by invigorating the blood. This strategy is consistent
with the nature and function of the Liver, as well as with the
relationship between the qi and blood. Because qi is the com-
mander of blood, its constraint invariably impedes the flow
of blood. Bitter and cooling Toosendan Fructus (chudn lian
zi), the chief herb, enters the Liver, Stomach, and Small Intes-
tine channels. It clears heat from the chest, hypochondrium,
and groin by draining it through the urine. When the heat
has been drained, and the fire constraint resolved, the Liver qi
can once again carry out its regulating function. Bitter, acrid,
and warming Corydalis Rhizoma (ydn hu sud) invigorates
the blood by moving the qi. Li Shi-Zhen praised its actions in
Comprehensive Outline of the Materia Medica, noting that “it
is able to move qi stagnation of the blood and blood stagna-
tion within the qi. Therefore, it specifically focuses on pain
throughout the entire body, both above and below. Hitting
the mark by using [this herb] is so sublime that it cannot be
expressed in words.” Acting as both assistant and envoy, it
thus reinforces the actions of the chief herb.

Cautions and Contraindications

Use with caution during pregnancy. This formula is inappro-
priate for pain from Liver qi constraint in the context of cold
conditions.

Commentary

The formula’s original indications were “heat inversion Heart
pain (FAK SA re jue xin tong) that is intermittent [in char-
acter| and has become chronic.” As such, it can be viewed as
an alternative to the treatment strategies for heart pain pro-
vided in Essential Formulas from the Golden Cabinet, which
focus on cold. Various commentators have interpreted ‘Heart’
here in both the narrow sense (i. e., referring to the heart
organ), and in the wider sense (i.e., as a body region that en-
compasses the chest, but also the Stomach). ‘Inversion’ refers
to a sudden upward-rushing of qi. In the present case, this is
hot or yang qi rushing upward from the Liver channel into
a body region where it does not belong and where it thus
constitutes an excess. The intermittent character of the pain
indicates that it is a manifestation of gi stagnation, while the
fact that it has become chronic implies that this stagnation
has also affected the blood. This explains the specific com-
bination of herbs in this formula. Toosendan Fructus (chuan
lian zi) was used by Jin-dynasty physicians such as Zhang
Yuan-Su as a specific herb for “heat inversion Heart pain,’
while Corydalis Rhizoma (ydn hu sud) is listed in the earlier
Grandfather Lei’s Discussion of Herb Preparation as treating
“unbearable Heart pain.’ In Six Texts Summarizing the Medi-
cine of Xu Ling-Tai, the Qing-dynasty commentator Xu Da-
Chun provides the following explanation:
