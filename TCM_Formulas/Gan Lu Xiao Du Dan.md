The formula clears heat while transforming the turbid dampness that blocks normal qi movement.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows antipyretic, hepatoprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects. Hua Shi and diuretic herbs promote toxin elimination through urine. Heat-clearing herbs reduce inflammation and support immune function. Studies demonstrate efficacy in viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis, and infectious diseases.

### Clinical Experience
