4 Method of Preparation Traditionally, the mineral ingredients

were crushed into small pieces and boiled in water three times.
The herbal ingredients were then boiled three times with the
minerals to produce a syrup. Powdered Natrii Sulfas (mdng xiao)
and Nitrum (xido shi) were mixed into this syrup, which was
then dried and powdered. The horns were filed and powdered;
Cinnabaris (zhi shd) was processed in water to remove impuri-
ties and then powdered; Moschus (she xidng) was powdered. All
of these powders were then sifted together to produce the final
formula.

The process is very similar today. Note that the original
text provides for 150g of Rhinocerotis Cornu (xi jido), which
is no longer used, primarily due to the endangered status of
the rhinoceros. Cinnabaris (zhii sha) is also removed due to
its heavy metal content, and gold is omitted, mostly because
of its expense. While the original source calls for # *& qing
mu xiang, it is generally agreed that the herb referred to is
Aucklandiae Radix (mi xiang) or Dolomiaeae Radix (chuan mi
xiang), and not the present-day Aristolochiae Radix (qing mit
xiang). This last herb is, in any case, no longer used because it
contains aristolochic acid.

Take in 1.5-3g doses 1-2 times daily with cool, boiled water,
preferably after meals. For children, the dosage is reduced sub-
stantially based on the age and size of the child.

Actions Clears heat, opens the sensory orifices, controls spasms
and convulsions, and extinguishes wind

Indications

High fever, irritability and restlessness, delirious speech, im-
paired consciousness, muscle twitches, spasms, convulsions,
thirst, parched lips, dark urine, constipation, a scarlet red
tongue with a dry, yellow coat, and a forceful, wiry, and rapid
pulse. Also used for febrile convulsions in children.

This is blazing heat sinking into the Pericardium and gen-
erating internal movement of Liver wind. It usually occurs in
the advanced stage of a warm-febrile disease. The heat sinks
into the interior of the body where it disturbs the Heart’s
spirit and impairs consciousness. In relatively mild cases, the
changes in consciousness can be limited to irritability, rest-
lessness, a sense of unease, an ongoing desire to sleep, and
delirious speech. If more severe, there can be a loss of con-
sciousness and an inability to be aroused. The blazing heat
injures the fluids and leads to high fever, thirst, parched lips,
dark urine, and constipation.

The blazing heat can stir Liver wind which, in turn, can
further fan the flames of the heat. As noted in Basic Questions
(Chapter 71), “Wind moves when it is vigorous.” This leads to
twitches, spasms, and, particularly in children, convulsions.
These symptoms, combined with the disturbance of con-
sciousness, are known as ‘tetanic collapse’ (#% JK jing jue).

Analysis of Formula

Cool, aromatic Bubali Cornu (shui niu jido) both ascends and
disperses. It enters the nutritive and blood levels, and is an
important substance for clearing fire and heat from the Heart
and Liver channels. It clears heat from the nutritive level, cools
the blood, and resolves toxicity. Because of its active nature,
it can be cold without retarding movement, making it useful
for venting heat through the collaterals of the Pericardium.
Saigae tataricae Cornu (ling ydng jido) is particularly use-
ful for draining Liver fire and is an important substance for
cooling the Liver and extinguishing wind. Together, these two
animal horns treat the heat in the Heart and Liver channels
and effectively resolve the spasms, convulsions, and impaired
consciousness. The intensely aromatic properties of Moschus
(she xiang) enable it to open the orifices of the Heart and re-
store consciousness. As these three ingredients together clear
heat, open the sensory orifices, and extinguish wind, they are
viewed as the chief ingredients.

Gypsum fibrosum (shi gdo) is an important substance
for clearing fire and heat from the qi level, causing the heat
to recede and encouraging the generation of fluids. It thereby
eliminates irritability and alleviates thirst. Glauberitum (hdn
shui sht} likewise clears heat and drains fire to eliminate ir-
ritability and alleviate thirst. The slippery quality of Talcum
(hud shi) enables it to conduct heat downward so that it can
be eliminated through the urine. Together, these three miner-
als are regarded as deputies in the formula for their ability to
clear and drain heat from the qi level.

Sweet, bitter, and slightly cold Scrophulariae Radix (xudn
shen) conducts fire downward, enriches the yin, and cools
the blood. It is combined with sweet, acrid, and slightly cold
Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng md) to strengthen its ability to
clear heat and resolve toxicity while also venting the patho-
gen. These herbs are also regarded as deputies because of
their effect on the heat.

Aucklandiae Radix (mu xiang), Aquilariae Lignum res-
inatum (chen xiang), and Caryophylli Flos (ding xiang) pro-
mote the movement of qi and assist Moschus (she xiang) in
opening the orifices. Magnetitum (ci shi) sedates the Heart
and calms the spirit, which strengthens the formula’s action in
eliminating irritability. Natrii Sulfas (mdng xido) and Nitrum
(xido shi) also drain heat and dissipate clumps, especially
when combined with Scrophulariae Radix (xudn shen}. This
strong, heat-clearing action is called ‘removing the firewood
from under the cauldron.’ These are all regarded as assistants.


492 Chapter 11 / Formulas that Open the Sensory Orifices

Today, the envoy is Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata (zhi gan
cdo), which helps resolve toxicity, harmonize the Stomach,
and protect it from injury by the heavy mineral ingredients.
Traditionally, gold (hudng jin), which weighs upon and se-
dates the spirit, was also regarded as an envoy.

Taken together, as noted in Zhang Shan-Lei’s Annotated
and Corrected Master Yan’s Discussion of Formulas for Chil-
dren, “Whenever qi and fire are extremely overabundant and
there are a variety of symptoms from ascending without de-
scending, this [formula] is especially appropriate.”

Cautions and Contraindications

Contraindicated during pregnancy and used with caution
in the weak and debilitated. The use of this formula should
be discontinued as soon as the symptoms of impaired con-
sciousness improve. Overuse of the formula can easily injure
the source qi and exhaust the yin, which, in severe cases may
lead to marked sweating, nausea and vomiting, cold extremi-
ties, a frozen affect, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, and ver-
tigo. While taking this formula, spicy, rich, or greasy foods
should be avoided.

Commentary

This is a very commonly used formula for treating high fevers
with changes in consciousness and signs of internal wind,
from mild twitching to full-blown convulsions. Because the
condition is due to intense interior heat, there will be con-
stipation, a scarlet red tongue with a dry, yellow coating, and
a rapid, forceful pulse. It uses ingredients for clearing heat
that are sweet and cold, instead of bitter and cold. This is
done to avoid injury to the fluids from the bitter ingredients,
which are drying in nature, and is recommended in treating
patterns of vigorous heat and injury to the fluids with such
manifestations as spasms and convulsions.

Origin and Variations of the Formula

The earliest known version of this formula is from the early
Tang-dynasty work Formulas of Su Gong (47 Si Gong
fang), recorded in Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Li-
brary. There are similar formulas found in other works. In
fact, according to the recent Formulas edited by Li Fei, there
exist more than 50 variations of this particular formula. Some
modifications are designed to emphasize certain specific
aspects or actions. An example is the increase in dosage of
Moschus (she xiang) in the version of the formula found in
Formulary of the Pharmacy Service for Benefiting the People
in the Taiping Era, which increases its effect in opening the
orifices. At other times, the goal appears to be a simplification
of the formula, as in the version found in Golden Mirror of
the Medical Tradition, which omits Magnetitum (cf shi), Tal-
cum (hud shi), Caryophylli Flos (ding xiang), Nitrum (xi@o
shi), and Moschus (she xiang), while adding Borneolum (bing

pian). As noted above, for over 30 years, the official formula-
tion in China has omitted the use of gold, and substitutes an
extract from Bubali Cornu (shui niti jido) for Rhinocerotis
Cornu (xi jide).

Controversy over Chief Ingredients

Similarly, commentators have expressed a variety of opinions
regarding the chief ingredients in the formula, reflecting dif-
ferent views about the nature of its principal indications. The
source text says that the formula is designed to treat “toxin
from leg qi that has spread everywhere, both internally and
externally” and “toxins from minerals, herbs, and heating
medicinals.” Before the early Qing dynasty, the formula was
therefore always viewed as one that cleared heat and drained
fire; thus, the minerals Gypsum fibrosum (shi geo), Glauberi-
tum (hdn shut shi), Talcum (hud shi), and Nitrum (xiao sh?)
were regarded as the chief ingredients. An example of this ap-
proach is reflected in Xu Da-Chun’s Patterns and Treatment
of Miscellaneous Disorders:

When toxin invades the channels and yang organs, heat
obstructs the consciousness (#7 84 shen ming) so there is out
of control mania and disorderly restlessness as well as pain in
the Heart and abdomen. This formula expels and directs toxic
miasmas downward, protects the Heart and calms the spirit,
and excels at treating all patterns of obstruction and clumping
from excessive fire.

Physicians of the warm pathogen current held a different
opinion. In Case Records as a Guide to Clinical Practice, Ye
Tian-Shi prescribes the formula for impaired consciousness
with tremors or convulsions from “a warm pathogen being
obstructed internally with clogging up of heat that extends
throughout the three burners.” This emphasizes the orifice-
opening actions of the formula; thus, in texts such as Con-
venient Reader of Established Formulas, the chief ingredients
are Moschus (she xiang), Cinnabaris (zhi sha), Nitrum (xido
shi), and Natrii Sulfas (mdng xido). At present, this formula
is primarily used for heat sinking into the Pericardium with
stirring of internal wind due to a variety of acute infectious
diseases; the chief ingredients are accordingly those listed
above: Bubali Cornu (shui niti jido), Moschus (she xiang), and
Saigae tataricae Cornu (ling yang jido).

Method of Preparation Separately grind each ingredient
into a powder and then sift together. Cinnabaris (zhi sha) and
Realgar (xieng hudng) were water-refined to remove impurities.
Originally, 50 pieces of silver leaf and 25 pieces of gold leaf were
= ground into a powder and added to the other ingredients. An
: additional 25 pieces of gold leaf were used to coat the pills. At
present, these two ingredients are no longer used. Also, originally,
one 3g pill was taken with a decoction of Ginseng Radix (ren
shen), At present, the dose is one 3g pill taken 1-3 times daily
with warm water. May also be administered by grinding into a
powder and dissolving in warm water. The dosage is half or less
for children. If the patient is unconscious, the formula may be
administered by nasogastric tube.
Note that the original text specified 30g of Rhinocerotis
= Cornu (xi jido), which is no longer used, primarily due to the
| codange status of the rhinoceros. In addition, at present, nei-
# ther Cinnabaris (zhii sha) nor Realgar (xieng hudng) should be
used due to their heavy metal content.

| Actions Clears heat, opens the sensory orifices, transforms
® turbidity, and resolves toxicity

Indications

Fever, irritability and restlessness, delirious speech, impaired
consciousness to the point of coma, copious sputum with
labored and raspy breathing, spasms, convulsions, a red or
deep-red tongue with a foul, greasy, yellow coating, and a
slippery, rapid pulse.

This is a closed disorder from phlegm-heat. It is usu-
ally associated with summerheat-stroke, wind-stroke, or the
advanced stage of a warm-febrile disease when heat sinks
into the Pericardium and turbid phlegm veils the orifices of
the Heart. When heat sinks into the Pericardium, it causes
disorientation by disturbing the spirit and gives rise to fever,
irritability and restlessness, delirious speech, or partial loss
of consciousness. The vigorous, blazing heat scorches the
fluids and causes them to condense into phlegm. Heat and
phlegm accentuate each other and completely veil the ori-
fices of the Heart, further disturbing the spirit and impairing
the consciousness. As the phlegm increases, the impairment
of consciousness becomes even more severe with such mani-
festations as loss of consciousness or coma.

Phlegm also obstructs the pathways of qi, giving rise to
copious sputum and rough breathing accompanied by raspy
sounds due to sputum in the throat. Extreme heat may gener-
ate internal wind, which manifests as spasms or convulsions.
The tongue is the ‘sprout’ of the Heart; when heat enters the
Heart and the nutritive level, the tongue becomes red or deep
red. The foul, greasy, yellow tongue coating and slippery, rap-
id pulse are indicative of phlegm-heat.
