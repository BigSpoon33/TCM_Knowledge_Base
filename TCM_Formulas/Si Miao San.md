364 Chapter 8 / Formulas that Tonify

The most likely cause of this pattern is improper diet, in-
cluding the excessive consumption of heating and cloying
foods that generate heat and obstruct the qi dynamic. Shen
Jin-Ao thus presents this formula along with Jade Spring Pill
(yix qudn wan), discussed below, for the treatment of wasting
from internal heat constraint (14 # xiao dan). He says the
following about the formula:

It generates essence, supplements the blood, nourishes dryness,
and relieves thirst. Alismatis Rhizoma (ze xie) and Aurantii
Fructus (zhi ke) assist by guiding out from and dredging the
two Intestines. This results in Heart fire descending; thus, the
Small Intestine is cleared and free-flowing. Lung metal is moist-
ened and the flow of the Large Intestine is smooth. Deep-seated
heat is dispersed and thirst is spontaneously relieved.

Heat from constraint damages the qi and fluids but because
the Stomach is the ‘sea of blood, it also readily penetrates into
the blood, where over the long term, it leads to blood and
essence deficiency. The 19th-century physician Fei Bo-Xiong
emphasized this aspect in his interpretation of the formula:

The subtlety of this formula lies in its augmenting the source of
water in addition to clearing metal and moistening the Lungs. It
furthermore includes Alismatis Rhizoma (ze xie) and Aurantii
Fructus (zhi ke) to drain constrained heat. When in this man-
ner the thirst is stopped, irritability and restlessness are also
eliminated.

The earliest reference to this formula, in Simple Book of
Formulas, recommends it for wasting and thirsting from
collected heat in the yang brightness. The pattern includes
damage to the yin and qi with symptoms of thirst, vexing
heat, lassitude of the spirit, and spontaneous sweating. Zhu
Dan-Xi also lists the formula as Rehmannia Drink (di hudng
yin zi) in Essential Teachings of [Zhu] Dan-Xi. His version is
identical, except for the omission of Aurantii Fructus (zhi ke).
Zhu states that the formula is suited for treating wasting and
thirsting disorder with irritability, dry throat, and red face.
Note that there is another, more commonly-used formula
called Rehmannia Drink from A Simple Book (di hudng yin
zi) from Comprehensive Recording of Sagely Beneficence. That
formula is discussed later in this chapter among the formulas
that tonify both the yin and the yang.

Comparison
> Vs. JADE SPRING PILL (yit qudn wan)

Both of these formulas tonify the yin and enrich the fluids
and are used in practice for the treatment of wasting thirst.
Rehmannia Drink from A Simple Book (di hudng yin zi) con-
tains more herbs that directly nourish the yin than does Jade
Spring Pill (yt qudn wan). In addition, it has a greater ability
to guide fire downward and dispense it through the urine and
stool. It relies on Aurantii Fructus (zhi ke) to promote free
flow in the chest and Large Intestine, and on the downward-

moving herbs Alismatis Rhizoma (ze xie) and Eriobotryae
Folium (pi pd ye) to
