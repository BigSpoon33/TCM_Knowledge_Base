designed for this type of problem. While formulas in Sun
Si-Miao’s Supplement to the Thousand Ducat Formulas and
Wang Tao’ Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library have
been superseded by those of later physicians, they are the ear-
liest extant examples of this type of prescription.

This category of formulas is generally prepared in the
form of pills, powders, or injectable concentrates, for two rea-
sons. First, they must be immediately available in emergencies
when there is no time to prepare a decoction. Second, they
cannot tolerate the heat of decoction because their constitu-
ents are quite volatile, and the heat will diminish their po-
tency.

The treatment of unconscious patients requires special
means of administration. Traditionally, the pills were placed
in the mouth to dissolve or powders were insufflated through
the nose. In modern times, other methods have been devised,
namely, administering through a nasogastric tube directly
into the stomach or preparing the medicine in such a way that
it can be given intravenously.

FORMULAS THAT CLEAR HEAT AND
OPEN THE SENSORY ORIFICES

The formulas in this section are used for hot-type closed
disorders in which the pathogenic heat or heat toxin sinks
into the Pericardium causing high fever, irritability and rest-
lessness, a red face, a yellow tongue coating, heavy breathing,
delirious speech, spasms, convulsions, and loss of conscious-
ness. These formulas are appropriate for treating wind-stroke,
the accumulation of phlegm, and other disorders presenting
with these manifestations.

The core ingredients of these formulas are those that aro-
matically clear heat and open the sensory orifices such as
Bovis Calculus (niti hudng), Moschus (she xiang), and Bor-
neolum (bing pian).

Given the importance of heat in these disorders, along
with the acridity or the aromatic ingredients (which can be
drying), it is important to include medicinals that clear heat.
These can be bitter and cold to resolve toxicity such as Copti-
dis Rhizoma (hudng lidn) and Scutellariae Radix (hudng qin);
acrid and cold to treat blazing fire without drying the fluids
such as Gypsum fibrosum (shi ga@o) and Glauberitum (hdn
shui shi); or cooling purgatives to treat any excess in the yang
organs such as Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) and Natrii
Sulfas (mdng xiao).

Because these patients are often very irritable and their
spirits are somewhat unmoored, it is important to use me-

dicinals that sedate and calm such as Succinum (hd pd), Mag-
netitum (cf shi), and Margaritiferae Concha usta (zhen zhi
mi).

Because these conditions often have an aspect of internal-
ly-generated wind, medicinals are often added to extinguish
wind and stop tremors. These include Saigae tataricae Cornu
(ling yang jido), Gastrodiae Rhizoma (tian md), and Uncariae
Ramulus cum Uncis (gou teng).

When the sensory orifices are veiled by phlegm, one
should add medicinals that clear heat and transform phlegm
such as Arisaema cum Bile (ddn ndn xing) and Fritillariae cir-
rhosae Bulbus (chudn bei mii).

This formula clears the Heart and opens the sensory orifices
with Bovis Calculus (niti hudng) as its chief ingredient. It is

drawn from a book by Wan Quan and bears this name to differ-
entiate it from other formulas with a similar name.

Method of Preparation The source text advises to grind the
ingredients into a powder and form into millet-sized pills with
flour and snow that has fallen during the twelfth month of the
Chinese calendar. Seven or eight pills are taken with a decoc-
tion of Junci Medulla (deng xin cdo}. At present, the ingredients
= are ground into a powder and formed into 1.5g pills with honey.
Two pills are taken 2-3 times daily, with a reduction in dos-

age for children. Note that due to the unacceptable toxicity of
Cinnabaris (zhi sha), it should no longer be used.

Actions Clears heat, resolves toxicity, opens up the orifices, and
calms the spirit

Seta

Indications

Fever, irritability and restlessness, generalized sense of un-
ease, delirious speech, impaired consciousness, and in some
cases childhood convulsions or the closed type of wind-
stroke. The tongue will be scarlet red and the pulse thin and
rapid or wiry and rapid.

This is pathogenic heat sinking into the interior and
entering the Pericardium. While heat entering the Lungs is
viewed as a normal transmission (IA/% shin chudn), this
is regarded as an abnormal transmission (i448 ni chudn),
at least since the time of Ye Tian-Shi. The distinction be-

tween normal and abnormal here refers to the more serious
nature of the latter compared to the former. It also refers to
the difference between Lung patterns, which relate to qi, and
Pericardium patterns, which relate to blood. Pathogenic heat
in this pattern penetrates from the qi into the nutritive and
blood aspect to harass the spirit and block the orifices of the
Heart. This manifests as fever along with irritability, restless-
ness, and a generalized sense of unease that can progress to
delirious speech and impaired consciousness. From an organ
perspective, it involves both the Heart and Liver, as noted in
the source text: “When the Heart transmits heat to the Liver,
wind and fire contend with each other.” In terms of warm
pathogen disorder theory, where the focus is on the Pericar-
dium rather than the Heart, the connection between these
organs is established both via the blood and the terminal yin.
The intense heat affecting two organs that focus on the blood
manifests as a scarlet red tongue. Depending on the intensity
of the heat vis-a-vis the wind, the pulse will be either thin and
rapid or wiry and rapid.

Analysis of Formula

This formula treats impaired consciousness from heat affect-
ing the Heart and Pericardium. It does this by focusing on
clearing and resolving toxic heat in the Pericardium with aro-
matic medicinals that open the sensory orifices, assisted by
others that sedate jitteriness and calm the spirit.

The chief ingredient is the aromatic, bitter, and cooling
Bovis Calculus (niti hudng), which excels at clearing intense
heat from the Heart and Liver while also venting pathogens
from the Pericardium. At the same time, this medicinal ex-
cels at dislodging phlegm, opening the orifices, extinguishing
wind, and stopping tremors. Three of the deputies—Coptidis
Rhizoma (hudng lidn), Scutellariae Radix (hudng qin), and
Gardeniae Fructus (zhi zi)—are bitter, cold herbs that are
good at clearing heat, draining fire, and resolving toxicity.
They are used here to aid the chief ingredient in clearing heat
from the Heart and resolving toxicity. New Compilation of
Materia Medica states that Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn)
“enters the Heart and Pericardium where it is the ultimate
at draining fire. It is also able to enter the Liver. While it can
guide into both of these channels, it is especially entrusted [to
guide other herbs] to enter the Heart.” Because this formula
emphasizes clearing heat and opening the orifices, Coptidis
Rhizoma (hudng lidn) has by far the largest dosage among
these heat-clearing, fire-draining herbs. The last deputy is
bitter and cooling Curcumae Radix (yi: jin), which also enters
the Heart and Liver channels. It is good at cooling the blood,
clearing the Heart, promoting proper movement of qi, and
opening up areas of constraint. It helps Bovis Calculus (niu
hudng) to clear the Heart and open the orifices. Together,
these medicinals clear heat, resolve toxicity, open the sensory
orifices, and calm the spirit.

Cautions and Contraindications

Do not use in abandoned disorders or for any problem that
is not due to clogging and overabundance. Due to the intense
bitter and cold nature of this formula, it should not be taken
long-term.

Commentary

In this formula, the clearing of heat and draining of fire is the
foundation; opening the orifices and calming the spirit is of
secondary importance. It can be viewed as a modification of
Coptis Decoction to Resolve Toxicity (hudng lidn jie di tang)
from Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library. The ingre-
dient in that formula that drained heat from the lower burner,
Phellodendri Cortex (hudng bai), has been replaced with me-
dicinals that enter the Heart channel to clear heat, open the
sensory orifices, and calm the spirit. In turn, this formula is
the basis upon which the Qing physician Wu Ju-Tong devel-
oped Calm the Palace Pill with Cattle Gallstone (an gong niu
hudng wan), which is the following entry.

Appropriate Presentation for this Formula

In the source text, this formula is prescribed for “Heart heat
with impaired consciousness.” This indication was expanded,
especially by the warm pathogen disease current. For ex-
ample, in the early 20th-century work Convenient Reader of
Established Formulas, it is noted that this formula should be
used:

[fjor a warm pathogen sinking internally such that the heat
enters the Pericardium, phlegm and mucus clogs and obstructs,
with such conditions as impaired consciousness, delirious
speech, sudden collapse, locked jaw, as well as acute fright wind
in children.

Identification

There is a very complex formula by the same name in For-
mulary of the Pharmacy Service for Benefiting the People in
the Taiping Era. It is based on Dioscorea Pill (# #4 4 shit yi
wan) from Essentials from the Golden Cabinet, and contains
29 ingredients. That formula, which focuses more on clearing
the Heart, transforming phlegm, and dispelling wind, is also
used in the present day and is known as Cattle Gallstone Pill
to Clear the Heart from the Formulary (niti hudng ging xin
wan -[ju fang]). To avoid confusion, the formula discussed in
this entry is commonly referred to as Wan’s Cattle Gallstone
Pill to Clear the Heart (Wan shi niti hudng qing xin wan).

Discussing the various formulas called Cattle Gallstone
Pill to Clear the Heart (niti hudng ging xin wan), Wang Zi-Jie

of Crimson Snow notes:
