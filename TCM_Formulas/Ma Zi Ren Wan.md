### Traditional Understanding
Classic formula for "intestinal dryness" constipation where the intestines lack sufficient fluid to move stool normally. Ma Zi Ren provides natural oils to lubricate the bowels while other herbs regulate qi and gently promote movement. Represents the gentle, moistening approach to constipation.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows Ma Zi Ren contains fatty oils that lubricate intestines and promote peristalsis. The combination demonstrates benefits in chronic constipation through multiple mechanisms: lubrication, qi regulation, and gentle laxation. Studies support safety for long-term use compared to harsh laxatives.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for chronic constipation in people with dry constitution, elderly patients, or those weakened by illness. Particularly effective for people who have tried fiber and other gentle approaches without success. Often provides relief within 1-3 days while being gentle enough for regular use.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Traditionally taken as pills, or decoct above doses once daily
**Preparation**: Pills preferred for convenience, decoction for acute cases
**Timing**: Evening dose preferred, can take morning if needed
**Duration**: Can be used long-term for chronic constipation, adjust as needed
