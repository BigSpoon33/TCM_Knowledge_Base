Research shows hormone-regulating, bone-strengthening, and immune-enhancing effects. Lu Jiao Jiao contains growth factors and amino acids that support reproductive function. Studies demonstrate efficacy in infertility, osteoporosis, and age-related decline.

### Clinical Experience
Essential formula for aging-related conditions and reproductive disorders. Often used for both men and women with fertility issues. Takes 3-6 months to see full effects. Best combined with lifestyle modifications and adequate rest.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: 6-9g granules twice daily, or traditional pills as directed
**Preparation**: Usually taken as pills, can be decocted
**Timing**: Between meals or with warm water
**Duration**: 3-6 months minimum for chronic conditions
