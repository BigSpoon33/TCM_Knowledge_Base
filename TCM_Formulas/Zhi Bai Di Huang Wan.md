Promotes urination and expels stones. For painful urinary dribbling
due to damp-heat in the lower burner characterized by urgent, burn-
ing, and painful urination, anuria, or oliguria due to stones in the
urinary tract. In contrast to the principal formula, this focuses on
stony painful urinary dribbling. This formula originated from the
Shuguang Hospital of the Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese
Medicine and its name can be attributed to the fact that three of the
ingredients’ names contain the word gold (4 jin). The specific ac-
tion of these three herbs—Lysimachiae Herba (jin qidn cdo), Lygodii
Herba (jin sha teng), and Gigeriae galli Endothelium corneum (ji nei
jin)—is to dissolve stones in both the urinary and bile tracts. Hence,
they are frequently combined for this purpose.

PES ee

Indications

Rough, painful urination that is red or the color of red bean
juice, or with multiple tiny stones. Urinary symptoms may be
accompanied by acute lower abdominal pain.

This is damp-heat bloody painful urinary dribbling,
which is usually due to overindulgence in spicy, sweet, or rich
foods, or overconsumption of alcohol. It may also be caused
by the penetration of damp-heat from the exterior into the
lower burner. If damp-heat pours into the Bladder, the heat
damages the collaterals, causing the blood to move recklessly.

This leads to rough and painful urinary dribbling. Damp-
heat collecting in the Bladder and clumping with the urine
may also produce stones through a process of steaming. This
manifests as painful urinary dribbling with stabbing pain and
the voiding of multiple tiny stones. Damp-heat obstructing
the qi dynamic in the lower burner leads to acute lower ab-
dominal pain.

Analysis of Formula

To treat blood in the urine due to reckless movement of
blood caused by damp-heat entering into the lower burner
blood aspect, this formula employs a combined strategy of
clearing the heat, cooling the blood, promoting water me-
tabolism, and unblocking painful urinary dribbling. As re-
flected in its original name, Gardenia Decoction (shan zhi
zi tang), the chief herb in this formula is bitter and cooling
Gardeniae Fructus (zhi zi), It clears heat from the qi aspect
via the Triple Burner and cools and moves the blood. It is
thus ideally suited for a pattern characterized by damp-heat
leading to reckless movement of the blood. The two depu-
ties are Poria rubra (chi fu ling) and Paeoniae Radix rubra
(chi shdo). Sweet and bland, Poria rubra (chi fu ling) drains
damp-heat from the Heart, Small Intestine, and Bladder by
promoting urination and unblocking the lower body orifices.
Unlike the closely related Poria (fu ling), Poria rubra (chi fu
ling) does not possess any tonifying properties that would
be counterproductive in an excess pattern such as this. Bitter
and slighlty cooling Paeoniae Radix rubra (chi shdo) enters
into the blood aspect to dispel constrained heat, enhancing
the efficacy of the chief herb at this level. It also moves the
blood, and, according to Divine Husbandman’s Classic of the
Materia Medica, stops abdominal pain and promotes urina-
tion. Warming, acrid, and oily Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang
gui) serves as the assistant, supporting Paeoniae Radix rubra
(chi shdeo) in moving the blood to dispel stasis and stop the
abdominal pain while moderating its cooling nature. It also
nourishes the blood to compensate for any blood loss. Glyc-
yrrhizae Radix (gan cdo), which drains fire, resolves toxicity,
and harmonizes the actions of the other ingredients, serves
as the envoy.

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula is indicated for excess-type painful urinary
dribbling. It should not be used without modification to treat
chronic conditions or patterns characterized by deficiency
and cold.

Commentary

According to its name, this formula is indicated for all five
of the different types of painful urinary dribbling (4% lin).
While there are different classification schemes, these are
usually considered to be hot, cloudy, bloody, consumptive,
and stony. In clinical practice, the present formula is most

effective for the heat type, especially if it is accompanied by
bleeding. It should be modified for treating other types of
painful urinary dribbling, as explained by the contemporary
physicians Zhu Liang-Chun and Xue Ban-Ding in Detailed
Explanation of Versified Prescriptions:

Viewed from the perspective of each individual herb’s [actions]
and their combination, this formula will be effective for hot
painful urinary dribbling where urination is rough and red [in
color. This manifests as] stabbing pain or blood in the urine.
The name of this formula—Powder for Five Types of Painful
Urinary Dribbling (wii lin sen)—implies that it can, by way of
modification through additions and subtractions, be used to
treat the five different manifestations of painful urinary drib-
bling.

Some possible modifications, drawn from the text by Zhu
and Xue, are listed later in this entry.

Comparisons

> Vs. E1GHt-HERB PowDeER FOR RECTIFICATION (bd zheng

Both formulas treat painful urinary dribbling caused by
damp-heat pouring downward into the Bladder. Powder for
Five Types of Painful Urinary Dribbling (wii lin san) clears
heat from constraint in both the qi and blood aspects that
causes reckless movement of blood. It is thus best suited for
treating excess heat patterns accompanied by blood in the
urine. By contrast, Eight-Herb Powder for Rectification (ba
zheng sdn) drains excess heat from the upper and lower burn-
ers via both the urine and stool. It is thus indicated for pat-
terns characterized by excess heat that has clumped in the
lower burner and manifests as Heart fire in the upper burner.

Actions Clears heat, enriches the yin, opens urinary obstruc-
tion, and promotes urination

&
2

Indications

Urinary obstruction, pain in the lower abdomen, rough and
painful urination, and absence of thirst.

This is urinary obstruction due to heat collecting in the
lower burner and obstructing the qi transformation of the
Bladder. This may also manifest as rough and painful urina-
tion, or as pain in the abdomen. Because heat in the Blad-
der and Kidneys steams the fluids upward to the Lungs and
Stomach, the patient does not feel thirsty. This sign distin-
guishes this pattern from similar ones caused by excess heat
in the upper or middle burners.

Analysis of Formula

To drain excess or pathogenic heat from the lower burner,
one should use bitter and cooling herbs that enter the Bladder
and Kidneys. Phellodendri Cortex (hudng bai), the chief herb
in this formula, fulfills these requirements. It drains fire from
excess affecting the Kidneys and clears lower burner damp-
heat, effectively removing the cause of urinary obstruction.
Phellodendri Cortex (hudng bai) is often combined with
Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mit), the deputy herb in this
formula, because their synergy amplifies the primary actions
of each herb, Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mii) is bitter and
cooling, but also moistening, thus preventing damage to the
yin by the extreme bitterness of Phellodendri Cortex (hudng
bdi). It enters the Lungs and Stomach from which it directs
the ‘yin fire’ (i.e., internal fire flaring upward from the lower
burner) downward toward its source. By contrast, Phello-
dendri Cortex (hudng bai) focuses only on the Bladder and
Kidneys, from which it effectively drains this fire out of the
body.

Acrid and warming Cinnamomi Cortex (rdu gui) serves
as the assistant. It is used in a small dosage to ensure that the
cooling nature of the chief and deputy herbs does not extin-
guish the physiological fire at the gate of vitality. By promot-
ing the qi dynamic in the lower burner, it anchors the yang qi.
This is called “guiding the dragon [i.e., the fire at the gate of
vitality] back to the sea [i.e., the lower burner].” Together, the
three herbs in this formula thus drain pathogenic heat with-
out injuring the physiological fire, and open urinary blockage
without damaging either the yin or yang.

Cautions and Contraindications

The bitter, cooling nature of this formula can easily injure the
Spleen qi. It is thus contraindicated for patients with Spleen
qi deficiency who suffer from diarrhea or thin stools. Because
it drains excess fire from the lower burner, it is also contrain-
dicated for Kidney qi and yin deficiency.

Commentary

This formula was composed by the Jin-dynasty physician Li
Dong-Yuan to treat “heat in the blood aspect of the lower
burner” characterized by “absence of thirst in spite of severe
dryness and urinary obstruction.” In this context, the term
‘blood aspect’ (2 4 xue fen) refers to yin, that is, the lower
burner, and not, as in Ye Tian-Shi’s later system of diagnosis,
to the end-stage in the progression of warm pathogen dis-
orders. This heat causes the qi transformation of the lower
burner to break down, which then manifests as urinary ob-
struction. This is similar to the condition treated by Five-
Ingredient Powder with Poria (wu ling sdn), discussed be-
low, where obstruction is caused by the penetration of cold.
However, whereas cold leads to a buildup of water (@ *K xiz
shui), heat steams the fluids in the lower burner upward. This
causes a person to feel no particular thirst, even as the Kid-
neys become dry.

The alternate name of this formula, Enrich the Kidneys
Pill (3 # 3t zi shen wan), has fueled debate among commen-
tators regarding the function of Phellodendri Cortex (hudng
bai) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mi) in relation to the
Kidneys. Some famous physicians of the period, notably Zhu
Dan-Xi, referred to this combination as tonifying the Kidney
yin. As late as the Qing period, we find statements like the fol-
lowing taken from Wang Ang’s influential Medical Formulas
Collected and Analyzed:

Phellodendri Cortex (hudng bai) is bitter, cooling, and slightly
acrid. It drains the Bladder [and] ministerial fire, tonifies insuf-
ficient Kidney water, and enters the blood aspect of the Kidney
channel. Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mii) is acrid, bitter, cool-
ing, and slippery. Above, it clears Lung metal and directs fire
downward. Below, it moistens Kidney dryness and enriches the
yin. Thus, the two herbs accentuate each other's actions, They
are an excellent prescription for tonifying water.


Formulas that Clear Heat and Expel Dampness 719

The tonifying action on Kidney water mentioned by Wang
Ang and others is difficult to understand given the bitter and
cooling nature of both herbs, which is drying and drain-
ing, and therefore damaging to both the Kidney yin and
yang. Following centuries of debate, a consensus has slowly
emerged that understands tonification in this case to be a
consequence of draining. By draining excess pathogenic heat
from the Bladder and Kidneys, Phellodendri Cortex (hudng
bai) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mi) effectively prevent
the heat from injuring the yin. The combination must not be
used, however, if the fire is due to deficiency of yin itself. In
that case, sweet, cooling herbs like Rehmanniae Radix (sheng
di hudng) and Scrophulariae Radix (xudn shen) would be ap-
propriate.

Li Dong-Yuan used variations of this formula to treat
internal obstruction of the eye and clouded vision. These
conditions are caused by pathogenic fire rising upward from
the lower burner and are treated by draining the fire at its
source. Later generations of physicians extended the applica-
tion of this formula even further. In Precious Mirror of Health,
Li Dong-Yuan’s disciple Luo Tian-Yi recommended the for-
mula for “treating lower burner yin deficiency [characterized
by] soft and forceless lower back and knees, sweating of the
genitals, impotence, and hot feet that are unable to walk.” In
Indispensable Tools for Pattern Treatment, the Ming-dynasty
writer Wang Ken-Tang prescribed it for “treating sores [due
to] yin deficiency of the Kidney channel [that leads to] fever,
thirst, bloody stools, and hot feet.” In Correct Transmission
of Medicine, the Ming-dynasty physician Yu Tuan used it “to
treat tinnitus and deafness.” Case Records as a Guide to Clini-
cal Practice show that Ye Tian-Shi utilized it in the treatment
of painful lower extremities due to heat from Kidney yin
deficiency as well as for headache, palpitations, paraesthesia,
and chronic bulging disorders due to up-flaring of fire. In the
case records of Xue Sheng-Bai, this formula is indicated for
“Spleen and Lung accumulation heat that causes wheezing
in children.” In all of these cases, heat in the upper, middle,
or lower burners is traced back to excess heat in the lower
burner and drained from there.

In practice, the chief and deputy herbs are often washed
in alcohol when they are intended to drain up-flaring heat
from the upper burner or baked with salt when one wishes to
focus more directly on symptoms in the lower burner.

> Vs. GREAT TONIFY THE YIN PIL (da bii yin wan)

Both formulas use the combination of Phellodendri Cortex
(hudng bai) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mii) to drain.
excess heat from the lower burner. However, Great Tonify
the Yin Pill (da bu yin wan) combines this pair with herbs
that strongly enrich the Kidney yin and essence. It is used to
treat patterns where excess heat has already damaged the yin

essence or for mixed excess and deficiency patterns charac-
terized by up-flaring of fire from the lower burner that leads
to night sweats or other manifestations of pathological heat.
