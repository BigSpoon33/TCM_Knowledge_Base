54 Chapter 1 / Formulas that Release the Exterior

Indications

Headache, fever, and slight chills without sweating following
a long-term illness or significant blood loss.

This is an exterior wind-cold disorder with simultane-
ous blood or yin deficiency due to a long-term illness or
significant blood loss. The headache, fever, and chills are the
classic presentation of wind-cold. The body is debilitated and
therefore does not have the strength to produce strong chills.
There is an absence of sweating not only because of the na-
ture of this exterior disorder (wind-cold), but also because it
is more difficult for the body to sweat when the blood or yin
is deficient.

Analysis of Formula

Although exterior disorders require sweating to release the
exterior, the presence of blood deficiency complicates the
situation since blood and sweat share the same source (see
COMMENTARY below). Traditionally, the sweating method
was contraindicated in cases of blood deficiency. For this rea-
son, the relatively mild, exterior-releasing Allii fistulosi Bul-
bus (ceng bdi), Sojae Semen preparatum (dan dou chi), Puer-
ariae Radix (ge gen), and Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng
jiaing), and the blood- and yin-nourishing Rehmanniae Radix
(sheng di hudng) and Ophiopogonis Radix (mai men deng),
are used. The ‘worked water’ was said to gently focus the for-
mula on the upper burner and assist in releasing the exterior.
The mild, exterior-releasing herbs also generate fluids; the
yin- and blood-nourishing herbs are also relatively light and
therefore noncloying. This formula is carefully balanced to
avoid excessive releasing action (which would exhaust the
blood or yin) and excessive tonification (which would cause
retention of the pathogenic influences).

Commentary

The close connection between blood and sweat (both of
which are fluids associated with yin) and the problems of
treating conditions that involve their intertwining relation-
ship were recognized very early in Chinese medicine. In
Chapter 18 of the Divine Pivot, it is noted that “Those from
whom blood flows [i.e., lose blood] do not have sweat, and
those from whom sweat flows [i.e., sweat profusely] do not
have blood.” Discussion of Cold Damage also states that “The
sweating [method] is forbidden in those with exhaustion of
blood; the bleeding [method] is forbidden in those with ex-
haustion of sweat.”

However, the blood that is tonified in the present for-
mula is not blood in a narrow sense (i.e., the essences that
turn red as they are transformed by the Heart), but rather
blood in a wider sense as encompassing the body fluids. Both
of the yin-tonifying herbs—Radix Rehmanniae Glutinosae
(sheng di hudng) and Ophiopogonis Radix (mai men deng)—
enrich these fluids but do not tonify the blood. This correlates

with the view of the much later Qing physician Ye Tian-Shi,
who emphasized in Discussion of Warm Pathogen Heat [Dis-
orders] that in the course of treating these illnesses, “one as-
sists yin not by focusing on the blood, but by focusing on the
yang fluids and the sweat.”

When using this formula, it is important to ensure that
any sweating that occurs as the result of administering the
formula not be excessive and to guard against the renewed
contraction of pathogens as the pores begin to open. For this
reason, the source text advises that the patient be covered
once they become aware that a sweat is developing. Given
the patient’s constitution (i.e., their deficiency of fluids), this
will not occur immediately but some time after the formula
has been taken. Lack of sweating, or difficulty in producing a
sweat, can thus be read as one of the key signs of this pattern.

Comparisons

> Vs. Moprriep SotMon’s SEAL DECOCTION
(jid jidn wei rut tang)

Differentiation of the proper use of these two formulas should
not be made on the basis that one supplements blood and the
other yin. Rather, the present formula focuses on early stage
invasion of wind-cold pathogens in patients with preexist-
ing deficiency of fluids (which may, in turn, be an aspect of
blood deficiency), whereas Modified Solmon’s Seal Decoction
(jia jidn wei ruf tang) is more suited to treating early-stage
warm pathogen disorders against a similar constitutional
background.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders, primarily
perimenstural or postpartum common colds.

Cautions and Contraindications

Only the slightest amount of sweating is desirable. Pro-
nounced sweating will aggravate the condition. For this rea-
son, the source texts advises to administer the decoction very
slowly and only after it has been determined that the patient
is definitely not sweating.

Modifications

* For strong chills, add Perillae Folium (zi si ye) and
Schizonepetae Herba (jing jie).

¢ For sustained high fevers, add Lonicerae Flos (jin yin hua)
and Forsythiae Fructus (lidn giao).

¢ For accompanying indigestion, add Citri reticulatae Peri-

Indications

Fever and slight chills, little or no sweating, headache, dry
throat, cough, sputum which is difficult to expectorate, thirst,
irritability, a dark-red tongue, and a rapid pulse.

This is externally-contracted wind-heat in a patient with
underlying yin deficiency. The headache, fever, slight chills,
little or no sweating, and cough are signs of wind-heat. The
dry throat, irritability, dark-red tongue, and rapid pulse in-
dicate that the externally-contracted condition has begun to
transform into internal heat. This relatively quick transforma-
tion is due to the underlying yin deficiency, a condition which
usually involves some degree of injury to the fluids; when
combined with wind-heat, thick sputum is produced that is
difficult to expectorate. Although most cases of wind-heat are
characterized by considerable sweating, there is little or no
sweating in cases with yin deficiency.

Analysis of Formula

Generally, it is not advisable to use yin-tonifying substances
when venting a pathogen from the exterior because their
cloying nature readily obstructs the qi dynamic. In the pres-
ent pattern, however, the body’s yin fluids are depleted and
need to be enriched in order to produce a sweat. For this
reason, this formula employs a strategy of simultaneously
tonifying the yin and venting wind-heat by means of acrid,
cooling herbs.

The chief herb, Polygonati odorati Rhizoma (yi zhi),
nourishes the yin of the Lungs and Stomach, clears heat, and

generates fluids. It is especially useful for its ability to toni-
fy without causing stagnation and thus can begin to restore
the fluids without getting in the way of the elimination of
the pathogens, which more cloying yin tonics might do. The
deputies, Allii fistulosi Bulbus (cong bdi), Platycodi Radix Gie
geng), Sojae Semen preparatum (dan dou chi), and Menthae
haplocalycis Herba (bd he), mildly release the exterior and
dispel wind-heat. Cynanchi atrati Radix (bdi wei), one of the
assistants, cools the blood and clears heat without injuring
the yin, thereby treating the irritability and thirst. The other
assistant, Platycodi Radix (jie geng), disseminates the Lung
qi to stop the coughing and expel the phlegm. The envoys,
Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata (zhi gedn cdo) and Jujubae Fruc-
tus (da zdo), assist Polygonati odorati Rhizoma (yi: zhi) in
moistening dryness and harmonizing the actions of the other
ingredients.

Commentary

The principal indications for this formula are fever with slight
chills, dry mouth, thirst, irritability, and a rapid pulse. Because
the pathogen is still in the exterior and has not yet penetrated
into the nutritive or blood levels, the tongue may still have a
thin or even white coating. If the tongue is peeled due to the
constitutional yin deficiency, it is not yet dark red.

Although this formula enriches the body fluids, its pri-
mary purpose is to vent the pathogen from the exterior, and it
is for this purpose (i.e., to produce a physiological sweat) that
body fluids are required. Wu Ju-Tong sums up this treatment
principle in Chapter 4 of Systematic Differentiation of Warm
Pathogen Diseases:

Sweat as a substance depends on yang qi for its movement and
on yin essence for its material basis. ... Those with a surplus of
yang qi and insufficient yin fluids, whose [fluids] are consumed
by the rising and discharging qi of warm-heat [pathogen
disorder], regardless of whether they spontaneously sweat
{caused by the surplus of yang qi] or not [because of the lack of
yin fluids], must have acrid and cool herbs [which disperse the
yang excess] used to stop the spontaneous sweating. Sweet, cool
and sweet, moistening herbs are used to nourish the yin fluids
which serve as the material basis [of sweat] in order to prepare
the ground for correct sweating.

The formula embodies this strategy inasmuch as the herbs
that nourish the yin and clear internal heat do not impede the
release of the exterior, while those that release the exterior do
not injure the yin.

This formula is based on Solomon’s Seal Decoction (wei
rui tang) from the Tang-dynasty classic, Important Formulas
Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces (see ASSOCIATED FORMU-
LAS below).

pathogen wind disease (2&2 wen feng zhi bing) characterized
by sweating, a sensation of heaviness in the body, wheezing, a sullen
demeanor, no desire to sleep, and a floating pulse at both the proxi-
mal and distal positions. This formula is stronger than the principal
formula and is indicated for a pattern of excess where the pathogen
has invaded both the qi and blood. For Sun Si-Miao, the author of
this formula, a warm pathogen disease was caused by a cold patho-
gen that invaded the body in winter and then lurked in the interior
until the spring, when the raising yang qi would become sufficiently
strong to engage it in battle and cause an acute illness. It was widely
assumed that patients whose yin essence was depleted were particu-
larly prone to this type of disease. For treatment, Sun composed a
formula that dispersed cold from the exterior as well as the blood,
cleared heat from excess, and augmented the fluids.

Because the formula contains many acrid, warm herbs, later phy-
sicians felt that it was inappropriate for treating true warm pathogen
disorders. In Developing the Meaning of Prescriptions Worth a Thou-
sand, the late-Ming dynasty scholar-physician Zhang Lu thus made
the following recommendations:

For [treating cases] with severe fever that has damaged the flu-
ids or with thirst in spite of a mild fever, it does no harm to re-
move Ephedrae Herba (md hudng) and Semen Pruni Armenia-
cae (xing ren) and replace them with Allii fistulosi Bulbus (cdng
bdi) and Sojae Semen praeparatum (dan dou chi) in order to
unblock constraint of the yang, and Trichosanthis Radix (tian
hud fen) in order to enrich the fluids. [In cases] with wheez-
ing and rising qi, Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chudan xieng) and
Angelicae pubescentis Radix (dui hud) should also not be used
lightly. Deficient [patients] cannot overcome cold [damage,
and using] Gypsum fibrosum (shi gdo) makes it [even more]
unlikely that this can be carried out. It should be replaced with
Lophatheri Herba (dan zhii ye) to clear the Heart and Poria

(fui ling) to secure the middle [burner] in order to provide for
tonification. In this manner, one supplies something that was
not yet attained [by Sun Si-Miao] in Important Formulas Worth
a Thousand Gold Pieces.

It was this suggestion that was later picked up by Yu Gen-Chu
and further developed into Modified Solomon's Seal Decoc-
tion (jid jidn wei rui tang).
