Formulas that Invigorate the Blood and Dispel Blood Stasis 559

¢ Blood deficiency is also intrinsically related to blood stasis.
Blood that is deficient readily becomes static and, in turn,
static blood interferes with the production of new blood.
Without the production of new blood, it is very difficult to
dispel blood stasis. This can lead to a vicious cycle. For this
reason, it is very common to include herbs that tonify the
blood in these formulas, such as Angelicae sinensis Radix
(dang gui), Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di hudng),
Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi shdo), Polygoni multiflori Radix
(he shou wii), and Asini Corii Colla (e jido).

°

Cold inhibits the free movement of blood and will gradu-
ally produce blood stasis with such manifestations as de-
layed menstruation with clots, fixed abdominal masses,
and amenorrhea, any of which may be accompanied by
abdominal distention and pain. The warming herbs used in
these circumstances include Evodiae Fructus (wu zhi yi),
Cinnamomi Ramulus (gu? zhi), Cinnamomi Cortex (rdu
gui), Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jidng), and Foeniculi Fruc-
tus (xido hui xiang).

Heat influences the blood when it occurs in organs that
have an intimate relationship with the blood or when it
enters the nutritive or blood levels of the body. This may
produce blood stagnation by ‘steaming’ or drying the
blood, which causes it to thicken, and by the tendency of
thickened blood to become stagnant and congeal. Heat
may also induce the reckless movement of blood such that
it leaves the vessels and produces rash, nosebleed, vomit-
ing or spitting up blood, coughing up blood, and blood
in the urine or stool. When bleeding occurs internally,
the blood may become congealed in the tissues outside
of the vessels. The cooling herbs that are commonly used
in these circumstances include Moutan Cortex (mu dan
pt), Paeoniae Radix rubra (chi shdo), Rehmanniae Radix
(sheng di hudng), and Scrophulariae Radix (xudn shen).

Other etiologies of blood stasis include traumatic injury, the
birthing process, and surgery. Because of the variety of etio-
logical factors and clinical manifestations, the practitioner
must be flexible in adapting the formula to fit the particular
circumstances of the case.

It is important to remember that, because the properties
of this class of formulas are quite strong for attacking firm
and congealed conditions in order to break up and drain
them, they should be prescribed with caution in the weak or
elderly, or in patients with patterns of deficiency. And because
some of the formulas strongly invigorate the blood and dispel
blood stasis, they are contraindicated during pregnancy and
in most cases involving excessive menstrual bleeding. Nor
should they be used in patients with bleeding diathesis or any
active hemorrhagic disorder.

H Actions Drains heat and breaks up blood stasis

Indications

Acute lower abdominal pain, smooth urination, night fevers,
delirious speech, irritability, restlessness and thirst, and a
submerged, full, or choppy pulse. In more severe cases, there
may be manic behavior. Women will usually experience dys-
menorrhea or amenorrhea.

This is blood buildup (% s@ xis xue) in the lower burner
caused by the accumulation of blood stasis and heat. The
source text attributes this condition to the transmission of
an externally-contracted pathogenic influence into the lower
burner. The static blood and heat obstruct the lower burner
and cause acute lower abdominal pain. The buildup of blood
disturbs the lower burner but does not disrupt the transfor-
mation of the Bladder qi, so urination is normal. Because the
heat is in the blood level, there is feverishness at night. The
Heart governs the blood and is the organ from which the
clarity of spirit emanates. Here the retained heat rises and
disturbs the spirit, producing abnormal and chaotic manifes-
tations of the spirit such as delirious speech, irritability, rest-
lessness, and thirst, or, in more severe cases, manic behavior.
Moreover, the accumulation and stasis of blood in the lower
abdomen inhibits blood circulation and causes amenorrhea
or dysmenorrhea in women.

Analysis of Formula

This is a modification of Regulate the Stomach and Order the
Qi Decoction (tido wei cheng qi tang) to which Persicae Se-
men (tdo ren) and Cinnamomi Ramulus (gu? zhi) have been
added. This changes it from a formula that purges clumping


560 Chapter 13 / Formulas that Regulate the Blood

of heat and stools to one that breaks up and expels blood
stasis. The chief ingredients are Persicae Semen (tdo ren),
which breaks up and eliminates blood stasis, and Rhei Radix
et Rhizoma (da hudng), which attacks and purges accumula-
tions and cleanses pathogenic heat. By attacking the blood
stasis and guiding it out of the body, the pathogenic heat is
left without anything to which it can attach, and is thereby
more easily cleansed or washed away. The ability of the dep-
uty ingredient, Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui zhi), to warm the
sinews, unblock the vessels, and dispel retained blood from
the lower burner effectively unblocks the circulation of blood
in the vessels and assists Persicae Semen (tdo ren) in breaking
up and eliminating blood stasis. One of the assistants, Natrii
Sulfas (mdng xiao), softens areas of hardness and dispels ac-
cumulation. This helps Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) in
moving the stool, draining heat, and eliminating blood stasis.
Serving as both an assistant and envoy, Glycyrrhizae Radix
preparata (zhi gan cdo) protects the Stomach and calms the
middle burner by moderating the harsh properties of the
other ingredients in the formula.

This formula thus effectively combines the draining of
heat with the breaking up of blood stasis. Taking the formula
should cause mild diarrhea or loose stools. These signs indi-
cate that the pathogenic heat and stasis are being eliminated.

Cautions and Contraindications

Contraindicated during pregnancy. If there are still exterior
symptoms, the exterior should first be released before using
this formula.

Commentary
Original Usage

In Discussion of Cold Damage this formula is indicated for
a greater yang-warp disorder with blood stasis in the lower
burner. This condition later became known as ‘blood buildup’
(¥ x2. xii xu2). In this situation, the source text tells us, there
are three possibilities:

1. If the blood descends (either of its own accord or follow-
ing treatment), the heat will follow the blood, and there
will be recovery.

2. If the exterior has not been released, one should not pro-
ceed to purge, but must first release the exterior.

3. If the exterior has been released but there is still acute
clumping (and pain) in the lower abdomen, then one may
purge.

It is the third scenario for which this formula is indicated.

The pathodynamic here is that contraction of external cold

in a person with strong yang qi causes that qi to become

constrained in the interior. This is known as ‘heat transforma-
tion. If the heat penetrates into the blood aspect, it will cause

blood stagnation. Because exterior cold is the original cause,
this must be expelled first in order to restore the qi dynamic.
Depending on the presentation, this can be achieved with a
formula such as Ephedra Decoction (md hudng tang) or Cin-
namon Twig Decoction (gui zhi tang). Once the exterior has
been resolved, the qi in the interior will also begin to move,
thereby eliminating the clumping. Only when this does not
happen must the clumping itself be purged.

Controversies

There has been much debate regarding both the pathody-
namic that leads to this pattern and also the precise location
of blood buildup in the lower burner. These issues, in turn, are
tied to a third question, namely, the function of the warming
herb Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui zhi) in a formula designed
to eliminate heat. One view, represented by the 11th-century
commentator Cheng Wu-Ji in Annotation and Explanation of
the Discussion of Cold Damage, is that “pathogenic heat in the
greater yang channel has not been resolved and [therefore]
follows the [greater yang] channel into its [associated] bow-
el, causing heat to clump in the Bladder.” In Writings on the
Esteemed Discussion, the Ming-dynasty physician Yu Chang
likewise argued that “acute clumping in the lower abdomen
indicates that the blood of the Bladder builds up and does
not move.” Although this interpretation explains how the re-
tention of an external pathogen leads to blood stasis in the
lower burner, it conflicts with several other key symptoms,
most specifically, the fact that urination is not impeded and
the absence of blood in the urine. Likewise, while these au-
thors can explain the use of Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui zhi) as
an herb that guides the formula into the Bladder, they do not
take into account that the formula is specifically designed to
eliminate pathogens via the bowels.

Another idea, adopted by a number of physicians over
time, was to take a broader approach to the meaning of the
term ‘Bladder’ in this context. For example, in his Investi-
gations of Medical Formulas, the Ming-dynasty writer Wu
Kun argued that the blood buildup occurs not in the Bladder,
but in the lower burner. He did not locate it precisely, leav-
ing space for later interpreters to offer a number of different
views. In Collected Writings on Renewal of the Discussion of
Cold Damage, Ke Qin maintained that it was the Intestines,
while in Discourse on Tracing Back to the Source of [the Dis-
cussion] of Cold Damage, Qian Huang located it even more
precisely in the ileum (@) ¥ hut chang).

Other commentators have looked at different structures.
In Simple Annotation of the Discussion of Cold Damage, the
Qing-dynasty physician Chen Nian-Zu suggested the Womb,
while in Records of Experiences with Classic Formulas, the
modern physician Cao Ying-Fu reasoned that both the In-
testines and the Womb were possible locations. In Treatment
Strategies and Formulas in Chinese Medicine, the contempo-


Formulas that invigorate the Blood and Dispel Blood Stasis 561

rary physician Chen Chao-Zu defined it functionally as the
blood aspect of the Liver channel.

In this manner, each writer offered his own reasons why
the source text’s reference to “heat clumping the Bladder”
could be extended to other organs. Some claimed that the text
had been corrupted, while others argued that the term “Blad-
der’ referred not to an organ, but to a body region—specifi-
cally the lower abdomen—in part relying on the Inner Clas-
sic, where the term Bladder is often matched with the Triple
Burner, as in Chapter 8 of Divine Pivot.

Usage

If these diverse readings cannot ultimately be reconciled, nor
in fact proven, the use of the formula in the clinic supports
the wider interpretation of the second group of writers. Over
the centuries, the formula has been used to treat any pattern
linked to the accumulation of heat and blood stasis in the
lower burner. These include traumatic injury with intrac-
table pain or difficulty in passing urine or stool; pain and
distention of the head, red eyes, and toothache that results
from blood stagnation due to the presence of vigorous fire;
nosebleed, vomiting, or coughing up blood due to reckless
movement of hot blood; gynecological disorders such as hot
flushes, amenorrhea, irregular menstruation, dysmenorrhea,
prolonged lochia, and even infertility; fixed, lower abdominal
pain; and severe wheezing and distention of the chest. The
wide scope of this formula in the modern clinic is reflected
in the BIOMEDICAL INDICATIONS below.

Besides symptoms that point to heat excess and blood
stasis more generally, the following key markers will be help-
ful in diagnosing this formula’s pattern:

¢ The abdominal symptoms are acute and there is fixed pain
that increases with pressure, usually in the lower abdomen.
Some Japanese Kampo physicians locate such hypersen-
sitivity predominantly in the left lower quadrant; others
argue that the distinguishing feature is that resistance is ex-
perienced on very superficial palpation and that, compared
to other patterns of blood stasis, areas of tenderness do not
have distinct boundaries.

The head will usually be hot, or there will be other symp-
toms of up-flushing such as headache, neck and shoulder
stiffness, dizziness, or tinnitus.

The lower body or extremities may be cold, even though
the patient feels subjectively hot.

If the spirit is disturbed, the manifestations will be irritabil-
ity, restlessness, anxiety or insomnia, and, in severe cases,
delirious speech or manic behavior.

If there is bleeding, the blood will be very dark purple with
clots. The tongue will have dark purple spots, and the pulse
will be submerged and choppy.

Issues Related to the Use of Cinnamomi Ramulus
(gui zhi)

Commentators have also fiercely debated the function of Cin-
namomi Ramulus (gu? zhi) in this formula. Some say that it
disperses blood, others that it serves as an envoy that guides
the formula into the Bladder, or that it moves the qi in order
to move the blood, or that it resolves the exterior. At least one
important commentator, Wang Ken-Tang in Indispensable
Tools for Pattern Treatment, states that Cinnamomi Cortex
(rou gui) should be used instead of Cinnamomi Ramulus (gu?
zhi).

One useful approach is to look at this question from the
source text itself, that is, to see how Cinnamomi Ramulus
(gui zhi) is used elsewhere in the writings of Zhang Zhong-
Jing. As discussed in the entry on Cinnamon Twig Decoction
(gui zhi tang) in Chapter 1, this herb focuses on the nutritive
qi, facilitating its movement and dispersion by means of its
acrid, warming nature. The nature of yang qi is to ascend
(from the lower to the upper burner) and that of yin blood
to descend (from the Heart to the Liver). Warming the qi to
move the blood, Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui zhi) is said both
to ascend and to direct downward. In the present formula,
herbs such as Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) and Persicae
Semen (tdo ren) guide Cinnamomi Ramulus (gu? zhi) into the
blood aspect of the lower burner where it assists in ordering
the qi and breaking up clumping by dispersing cold. As noted
by the late 19th-century physician Tang Zong-Hai in Discus-
sion of Blood Patterns:

Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui zhi) reports to the Liver channel’s
wood fire qi as to a superior. [If one uses it when] Liver qi is
hyperactive, one will observe [symptoms of yang qi] blazing
[upward]. Clumped Liver qi [on the other hand] is moved
when encountering [this herb]. Therefore, it can sometimes be
indicated and sometimes be contraindicated in [the treatment]
of blood [aspect] patterns. This formula avails itself of its acrid,
dispersing [nature, but by means of] Natrii Sulfas (mdng xido),
Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng), and Persicae Semen (tdo
ren) directly moves downward into the lower burner to break
up clumping and facilitate the movement of blood. The only
two paths of exit for static blood are the urine and the bowels.
[Hence, while] Natrii Sulfas (mdng xiao) and Rhei Radix et
Rhizoma (da hudng) guide it out via the bowels, Cinnamomi
Ramulus (gu) zhi) simultaneously [facilitates] qi [transforma-
tion] and thereby urination. These were [Zhang Zhong-Jing’s]
intentions in the first place.

The source text states that the ingredients are ground and made into
four pills with honey, with each pill decocted in 1 cup of wine until
0.8 cup is left. At present, the ingredients are ground (using the dos-
ages in parentheses) and made into 9-15g pills with honey. One pill is
taken daily with a small amount of wine. Alternatively, it can be taken
as a decoction. The honey ameliorates the harshness of the ingredi-
ents and spreads out their actions over time. Decocting in wine helps
guide the effects of the formula into the blood aspect.

This formula drives out stasis and drains the heat. It was origi-
nally used for abdominal pain during pregnancy due to what was
considered to be dried blood below the umbilicus. At present, it is
used much more often for similar problems postpartum. It is also
an important formula for amenorrhea due to blood stasis as well as
chronic lower abdominal inflammatory disorders in both men and
women such as pelvic inflammatory disease, prostatitis, and lower
back disc disease.

In contrast to the principal formula, it is used for piercing pain
in the lower abdomen that gets worse with pressure and may be ac-
companied by palpable masses. And unlike the principal formula, its
presentation does not include any signs of disrupted spirit or mania-
like symptoms.

Actions Breaks up and dispels blood stasis

Indications

Firmness and distention of the lower abdomen, smooth uri-
nation, manic behavior, forgetfulness, black stools that are
easy to expel, and a submerged and slow-irregular pulse. In
women, there may also be delayed menstruation or amenor-
thea. Also treats jaundice.

This is blood buildup in the lower burner caused by
clumping of heat and blood. The heat causes the blood to be-
come thick, slowing its flow and causing stasis. This becomes
apparent in the firmness and distention of the lower abdo-
men. Because the stasis is at the level of the blood and not the
qi, urination is not impeded and the stools are easy to expel.
Black stools, delayed menstruation, or amenorrhea, however,
indicates that the movement and generation of blood is ab-
normal. The Heart is the organ that governs the generation of
blood and harbors the spirit. When the static heat flushes up-
ward to harass the Heart spirit, this leads to manic behavior.
Blood stasis impeding the production of new blood, on the
other hand, is reflected in forgetfulness. The submerged pulse
identifies this as an interior problem, while its slowness and
irregularity reflect blood stasis. Jaundice is a sign of damp-
heat. This can occur when yang brightness excess heat (rather
than greater yang cold that has transformed into heat) is the
root cause of the problem.

Analysis of Formula

The symptoms that characterize the pattern treated by this
formula indicate that the stasis is severe, and that the momen-
tum of the disorder is progressing. In this situation, mild pur-
gation is no longer appropriate, and attacking with strong-
acting, stasis-breaking substances is the appropriate strategy.
For this purpose, the formula employs two animal medicinals
as chief ingredients. Salty, bitter, neutral, and slightly toxic
Hirudo (shui zhi) enters the Liver channel and, in the words
of the Divine Husbandman’s Classic of the Materia Medica,
“expels noxious blood and static blood” In Essays on Medi-
cine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western, Zhang

Xi-Chun observes that this substance has the special charac-
teristic of entering only the blood aspect, allowing it to ex-
pel static blood without damaging the qi. Slightly bitter and
slightly cooling Tabanus (meng cheng) also enters the Liver
channel and is even stronger than Hirudo (shui zhi) in break-
ing up blood stasis. Amplifying each other's characteristics,
these two substances have a synergy that makes this one of
the strongest blood stasis-expelling formulas. The addition of
Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) and Persicae Semen (tdo
ren) further reinforces this effect. Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da
hudng) also opens the bowels, following the momentum of
the pathology (i.e., the downward movement of heat and its
clumping in the lower burner) to create a route for the heat
to leave the body, as noted in Basic Questions (Chapter 5):
“Draining downward is guiding out and exhausting [what is
stagnating internally].”

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula is indicated only for excess-type blood stasis
patterns in the lower burner. It should not be prescribed in
case of deficiency or during pregnancy.

Commentary

This formula treats late-stage blood buildup in the lower
burner, where heat has substantially dried up the blood and
caused palpable hardness.

Use of Animal Substances

Because this is a deep-seated condition located entirely at
the blood level, the formula uses animal substances to break
up stasis. Many physicians agree with Ke Qin, quoted in the
Golden Mirror of the Medical Traditions: “When static blood
is indicated by signs such as these, only harsh prescriptions
are capable of reaching the lair [of the pathogen] and are
appropriate for carrying out the weighty task [of flushing it
out].” In Selected Annotations to Ancient Formulas from the
Garden of Crimson Snow, the Qing-dynasty commentator
Want Zi-Jie explains why this is so:

Blood buildup belongs to [disorders characterized] by dead yin.
The true qi moves [normally] but can [no longer] enter into it.
Therefore, herbs alone are unable to treat this pathogen. One
must use those nimble creatures that have a liking for blood in
order to guide {the static blood] out. [Medicinals made from]
flying [creatures] move through the yang collaterals. [Those
made from creatures] that live under water move through the
yin collaterals. [In this formula, Tabanus (meng chong) and
Hirudo (shui zhi)| thus guide Persicae Semen (tdo ren) toward.
attacking the blood, and Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) to
purge heat to break the merciless clumping of blood. It is truly
an appropriate formula for carrying out a difficult [task]. There
is no need to fear the venomous nature of these medicinals.

Wang Zi-Jie’s theory regarding the ability of animal sub-
stances to enter the collaterals has been especially influential.
