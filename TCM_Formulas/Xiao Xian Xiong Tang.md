Formulas that Sedate and Calm the Spirit 477

Indications

Palpitations, insomnia, tinnitus, and diminished acuity of
hearing and vision. Also used for seizures.

This is ascendant Heart yang with lack of communica-
tion between the Heart and the Kidneys. Under normal con-
ditions, the Heart in the upper burner governs the down-
ward-directing of (sovereign) fire and its transformation into
essence. The Kidneys in the lower burner store the essence
and govern their transformation into (ministerial) fire. In this
way, fire and water mutually generate and control each other.
This ensures the controlled diffusion of yang qi to the sensory
organs, with the Heart above regulating the release of essence
and qi from the Kidneys below, while the Kidneys root the
spirit residing in the Heart. This is explained by Wang You-
Yuan in Discussion of Famous Physicians’ Formulas Past and
Present: “The Kidneys alone store the essence. Therefore, the
water of the spirit [4 shen shui; this term can also refer to
saliva] develops in the Kidneys. The Heart is the illuminating
fire { 3% Ii zhao; & Ifis sometime used to refer to the fire at
the gate of vitality, hence this term brings into play the rela-
tionship between sovereign and ministerial fire]. Therefore,
the brightness of the spirit develops in the Heart.” Thus, when
communication is lost between the Heart and Kidneys, Heart
yang ascends excessively, depriving the spirit of its calm place
of abode. This leads to palpitations and insomnia. It also pre-
vents the essence in the Kidneys from ascending harmoni-
ously to nourish the ears and eyes, diminishing the acuity
of hearing and vision. In very severe cases, the uncontrolled
upsurge of gi that this lack of communication implies may
manifest as internal wind and seizures, as the Kidneys and
Liver are said to have the same source.

Analysis of Formula

This formula aims to restore the normal physiological com-
munication between Heart and Kidneys, primarily by pacify-
ing the hyperactive yang. The idea is to root the floating qi
once more in the Kidneys, restoring the physiological balance
between above and below, water and fire. The chief ingredient,
salty, cold, and heavy Magnetitum (ci shi), enters the Kidneys,
anchors and calms the spirit, weighs down the yang while
nourishing the yin, and improves the acuity of hearing and
vision. Comprehensive Outline of the Materia Medica notes
that it “treats all disorders of the Kidneys, while unblocking
the ears and brightening the eyes.” Seeking Accuracy in the
Materia Medica says that it “enters the Kidneys to sedate the
yin, preventing the dragon [i.e., ministerial] fire from rising
upward out of the yin.” The deputy, Cinnabaris (zhu sha),
sedates and calms the spirit, and clears heat from the Heart.
Cinnabaris (zhi sha) is red and corresponds to the fire phase,
like the Heart; Magnetitum (c/ shi) is black and corresponds
to the water phase, like the Kidneys. Together, they anchor the
spirit and pacify the floating Heart yang so that it can interact

with the Kidneys. In this manner, the fire in the Heart is con-
trolled and the essence in the Kidneys is able to rise, which
gradually resolves the condition.

One assistant, Massa medicata fermentata (shen qi),
strengthens the Spleen and Stomach and aids digestion. Not
only does it prevent injury to the Stomach qi from the heavy
metals, it also helps disseminate their actions throughout the
body. Focusing on the middle burner, the fulcrum of the gi
dynamic, it also plays an active role in stabilizing the normal
ascending and descending of the essence and fire. The other
assistant, honey, serves as the filler for the pills and also toni-
fies the middle burner.

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula should not be used without significant modifi-
cation for problems with visual or auditory acuity associated
with fire from Liver and Kidney deficiency. In patients with
a weak digestive system, the dosage should be reduced and
carefully monitored. At present, the heavy metal toxicity of
Cinnabaris (zhi shad) renders its use obsolete and requires
substitution.

Commentary

In the source text, the emphasis of this formula is on treating
problems with visual and auditory acuity. It was only dur-
ing the Qing dynasty that physicians like Ke Qin and Chen
Nian-Zu emphasized its role in treating seizures, mania, and
epilepsy, from which its modern usage in treating insomnia
and palpitations arose. Even today, however, the original indi-
cations are still the distinguishing symptoms for this formula,
and it continues to be one of the most important formulas
for treating visual problems due to internal injury, particu-
larly when the pattern is lack of communication between the
Heart and Kidneys. In Selected Annotations to Ancient For-
mulas from the Garden of Crimson Snow, Wang Zi-Jie outlines
the pathodynamic at the root of this disorder and explains
why the formula is so well-suited to its treatment:

Sun Si-Miao, Ni Wei-De, and Li Dong-Yuan all say that dilated
pupils are due to Heart fire encroaching on the Lungs and
ascending into the brain to scorch the marrow. As the nature of
fire is to disperse, the pupils dilate. Ni states that acrid, heating
[medicines] are contraindicated. Li states that cold and cooling
[medicines] are contraindicated. Sun Si-Miao states that [this
formula] benefits the power of the eyes. No [other] common
formula is as good as this one.

The use of this formula in the treatment of tinnitus, deafness,
and aural hallucinations is also due to its ability to control
‘upward rushing of deficient yang’ (2 E# xii ydng zhi
shang ben). The yang referred to in this quotation from Wang
You-Yuan is the ministerial fire, while deficiency refers to the
Kidneys’ inability to organize its harmonious ascent. Like all
other commentators, Wang here points to a breakdown of


478 Chapter 10 / Formulas that Calm the Spirit

the qi dynamic as the root cause. Thus, even though the texts
speak of fire and water, pronounced signs of heat or cold
need not be present to diagnose this pattern.

The original name of this formula was Massa Medicata
Fermentata Pill (shen gu wan), which is also the ingredient
with the highest dosage. Some physicians, such as Ni Wei-
De, therefore point to this herb as the true fulcrum of the
formula. Wang Zi-Jie links its use to alchemical techniques
expounded in the Song dynasty Daoist classic, Awakening to
the Real. Ke Qin, too, expounds its virtues in Golden Mirror of
the Medical Tradition:

Massa medicata fermentata (shen qi) pushes out the old and
creates space for the new. Connecting with the Heart spirit
above and reaching the resolve [stored in the] Kidneys below,
it generates know-how. Furthermore, food is assimilated to

the yin, but its strength is emitted [through] the yang. Guard-
ing one’s diet is thus all [one needs to take care of]. This is the
strategy by which the Inner Classic treats mania. When [har-
bored] food is eliminated, one clearly knows what to do, and
the essence spirit is regulated. This is the intended use of Massa
medicata fermentata (shen qi).

Comparison

> Vs. CINNABAR PILL TO CALM THE Spirit (zhit shd Gn
shen wan)

Both of these formulas treat disordered spirit associated with
Heart excess patterns manifesting with symptoms such as
agitation, irritability, restlessness, palpitations, insomnia, and
dream-disturbed sleep. However, Cinnabar Pill to Calm the
Spirit (zhi sha an shen wdn) focuses on cooling the flaring
Heart fire that is damaging the blood and yin fluids. Besides
the symptoms outlined above, this type of fire is experienced
as disorientation, a sensation of fullness in the chest or of heat
flushes, and even occasional vomiting or retching, Magnetite
and Cinnabar Pill (cf zhi wan), on the other hand, focuses
on directing the floating yang downward to anchor it in the
Kidneys. It is thus primarily used to reconnect the Heart and
Kidneys, with symptoms such as mania, tinnitus, deafness,
or epilepsy. It is also an important formula for eye disorders
presenting with blurred vision.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used

to treat a wide variety of biomedically-defined disorders.

These can be divided into the following groups:

* Disorders of the eyes including cataracts, optic nerve atro-
phy, and disorders of the vitreous humor or lens

* Psychoneurological problems including some types of neu-
ral deafness, aural vertigo, epilepsy, tinnitus, and visual hal-
lucinations associated with schizophrenia.

This formula has also been used in the treatment of hyper-
tension.

‘ Actions Sedates the Heart, eliminates phlegm, clears fire, and
© calms the spirit

Indications

Restless agitation, bad temper, severe and throbbing head-
ache, insomnia, extreme emotional instability, manic behav-
ior, shouting, yelling at people for no apparent reason, red-
dish eyes, a scarlet tongue with a yellow, greasy coating, and
a wiry, rapid pulse.

This is manic behavior due to phlegm-fire agitating the
Heart. Emotional constraint in people with a robust constitu-
tion manifests in stagnation of yang qi that transforms into
heat, accompanied by an accumulation of stagnant fluids that
transform into phlegm. Phlegm and heat clump and under
certain circumstances ‘explode’ upward as phlegm-fire. Be-
cause of its excess nature, such a pattern is also known as
‘yang brightness phlegm-fire’ The explosion upward leads
to a severe, throbbing headache. It disturbs the spirit and
manifests as restless agitation, bad temper, and insomnia.
Phlegm-fire veils the sensorium (i.e., the orifices of the Heart
and spirit), leading to extreme emotional instability, manic
behavior, shouting, and yelling at people for no apparent rea-
son. The reddish eyes, scarlet tongue with a yellow, greasy
coating, and the wiry, rapid pulse reflect the combination of
ascendant yang, fire, and phlegm.

Analysis of Formula

To effectively treat acute manic behavior from phlegm fire ha-
rassing the upper burner, one should use a strategy of sedat-
ing the Heart and calming the spirit, flushing away phlegm,
and clearing fire. The chief ingredients in this formula are
Ferri Frusta (sheng tie luo), which enters the Liver channel
to treat anger and mania, and Cinnabaris (zhi sha), which
enters the Heart. Both strongly anchor and weigh down the
spirit.

The deputies are of three types. The first group clears
heat and flushes out phlegm. It consists of bitter and cool-
ing Arisaema cum Bile (den ndn xing), an important herb
for dispelling wind-phlegm and treating seizures, and bit-
ter, sweet, and cooling Fritillariae Bulbus (bei mt), which
enters the upper burner to clear Heart fire and disperse Lung
constraint. The second group eliminates phlegm, opens the
sensory orifices, and calms the spirit. It includes acrid and
slightly warming Acori tatarinowii Rhizoma (shi chang pii),
which is said to direct qi downward and thus works well
together with acrid, bitter, and slightly warming Polygalae
Radix (yudn zhi), which is said to raise the qi. Bland and
sweet Poriae Sclerotium pararadicis (fa shen), which drains

dampness and thereby deprives phlegm of its source, also
belongs to this group. The third type of deputies clears Heart
fire and relieves irritability. It includes bitter and slightly
cooling Forsythiae Fructus (lidn giao), which is light and
opens constraint in the upper burner; bitter and slightly
cooling Salviae miltiorrhizae Radix (dan shen), which clears
heat from the blood aspect and prevents blood stasis; sweet
and slightly cooling Uncariae Ramulus cum Uncis (geu
teng), which dispels wind-heat and settles fright; and bitter,
sweet, salty, and cooling Scrophulariae Radix (xudn shen),
which enters the Kidneys, clears floating heat, and, according
to Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians, is said “to
govern |the treatment] of mania [characterized by] extreme
confusion and the inability to recognize people.” Work-
ing together, the deputies support the function of the chief
ingredients by ordering the pathologies of the fluid metabo-
lism that manifest as phlegm: opening stagnation through
acrid and bitter dispersal to promote the unhindered diffu-
sion of fluids; clearing fire from the protective, nutritive, and
blood aspects to prevent the clumping of fluids and heat that
produces phlegm; and dispelling wind in order to regularize
the movement of qi.

The assistants further consolidate these effects. One
group, comprised of Poria (fi ling) and Citri reticulatae Peri-
carpium (chen pi), treats phlegm at its source by improving
the function of the Spleen and qi. The other group, comprised
of Ophiopogonis Radix (mdi men dong) and Asparagi Radix
(tian men dong), nourishes the yin to replenish the physi-
ological fluids.

Commentary

This is a rather effective formula in treating the manic behav-
ior associated with phlegm-fire. Cheng Guo-Peng, author of
the source text, notes that most people who take it for twen-
ty-odd days will be cured. He also states that if there is also
constipation, the patient should first be given Flushing Away
Roiling Phlegm Pill (gin tan wan).

Historically, this is one of the few formulas that can be
traced back to the Inner Classic. Basic Questions, Chapter 26,
recommends the use of a decoction made from Ferri Frus-
ta (sheng tie lud} to treat ‘yang inversion’ (PAK ydng jue), a
condition characterized by mania and anger due to sudden,
strong upward-flushing of qi.

Comparison

> Vs, CINNABAR PILL TO CALM THE Spirit (zhi sha an

Both of these formulas treat disordered spirit associated with
patterns of Heart fire excess. However, Cinnabar Pill to Calm

fire arising from internal causes, specifically disordered emo-
tions, and the formula focuses on guiding yang fire excess
downward by means of bitter, cooling, and heavy settling sub-
stances. Iron Filings Drink (sheng tie lud yin), on the other
hand, is primarily indicated for patterns where phlegm-fire
agitating the Heart leads to manic behavior. For this pur-
pose, the formula combines herbs that transform and dispel
phlegm with substances that sedate the Heart and cool the
fire. No bitter, cooling substances are used as these might fur-
ther inhibit the qi dynamic.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
some psychiatric diseases and epilepsy.

Modifications

¢ For thirst with a desire to drink, and parched mouth and
lips, add Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao), Anemarrhenae Rhi-
zoma (zhi mu), and Dendrobii Herba (sht ha).

For pronounced irritability and insomnia due to phlegm-
heat, add Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn), Rehmanniae Ra-

For red eyes and a thick, yellow tongue coating, add Saigae

For abdominal distention accompanied by a sense of full-
ness, constipation, and a dry tongue coating, combine with
Regulate the Stomach and Order the Qi Decoction (tido

of Rhinocerotis Cornu (xi jido), which is no longer used, pri-
marily due to the endangered status of the rhinoceros. Also,
Codonopsis Radix (ddng shen) is usually substituted for Ginseng
Radix (ren shen) at 2-3 times its dosage. Originally, 0.9-1.5g of
Margarita (zhen zhit) was used instead of Margaritiferae Concha

much less expensive.

EAL

= Actions Enriches the yin, nourishes the blood, sedates the
= Heart, calms the spirit, calms the Liver, and anchors the yang

Indications

Irritability, restless sleep, occasional palpitations with anxiety,
dizziness, and a thin, wiry pulse.

This is concurrent blood and yin deficiency with ascen-
dant Liver yang. When the yin and blood are insufficient, the
yang loses its control and becomes hyperactive. Rushing up-
ward, it harrasses the upper burner, causing dizziness. Inter-
nally, the uncontrolled movement of yang qi is experienced as
irritability. Entering the Heart, it leads to palpitations, restless
sleep, and anxiety. The thin, wiry pulse reflects deficiency of
yin and blood complicated by the excess condition of hyper-
active Liver yang.

Analysis of Formula

While blood and yin deficiency are the true root of this pat-
tern, this formula primarily seeks to control the hyperac-
tive yang. To this end, it combines heavy, settling ingredients
aimed at calming the spirit and anchoring the yang with
herbs that nourish the blood and enrich the yin. The chief
ingredients are salty and cooling Margaritiferae Concha usta
(zhen zhi miu) and astringent and slightly cooling Fossilia
Dentis Mastodi (leng chi). By means of their heavy nature,
these substances calm the Liver, sedate the spirit, and anchor
the errant yang. They are supported by three deputies: sweet,
sour, and balanced Ziziphi spinosae Semen (sudn zdo ren),
sweet and acrid Platycladi Semen (bdi zi ren), and sweet and
bland Poriae Sclerotium pararadicis (fu shen). Because of
their ability to nourish the Heart and regulate its physiol-
ogy, these herbs are commonly used together in formulas
that calm the spririts. They do so primarily by harmonizing
the physiology and nature of the nutritive qi and blood on
which the Heart depends for its nourishment.

This function is further supported by the three assis-
tants: sweet, acrid, and warming Angelicae sinensis Radix
(dang gui), sweet, rich, and slightly warming Rehmanniae
Radix preparata (shti di hudng), and sweet, slightly bitter,
and slightly warming Ginseng Radix (ren shen). Together,
these herbs tonify the qi, nourish the blood, and enrich the
yin. They thereby assist the chief ingredients in anchoring
the yang, while providing the spirit with an abode. Bitter,
salty, and cooling Bubali Cornu (shui niti jido) and acrid, bit-
