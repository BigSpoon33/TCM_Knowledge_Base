## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
"Zhi Sou" means "stop cough" - this is the classic formula for chronic cough with external wind and internal phlegm. The combination addresses both the surface wind component and the deeper phlegm-dampness, making it ideal for lingering coughs that persist after acute illness.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows antitussive, expectorant, and anti-inflammatory effects. Jie Geng contains saponins with expectorant properties. Zi Wan and Bai Bu provide compounds with cough-suppressing actions. Studies demonstrate efficacy in chronic bronchitis and post-infectious cough.

### Clinical Experience
Essential formula for chronic cough that doesn't respond to simple treatments. Particularly effective for coughs that linger after respiratory infections. Often used as base formula with modifications for specific patterns. Usually provides relief within 1-2 weeks.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, don't overcook to preserve volatile oils
**Timing**: Between meals, can take with honey for throat coating
**Duration**: 2-6 weeks for chronic cough, shorter for acute cough
