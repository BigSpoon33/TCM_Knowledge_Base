Formulas that Warm the Middle and Dispel Cold 273

ducing excessive dampness without injuring the fluids, and
promoting the movement of yang without dispersing the qi.

Cautions and Contraindications

This is a heating and tonifying formula. It must not be used
in cases of hard stools caused by heat or yin deficiency.

Commentary

This formula is an example of a strategy known as ‘augment-
ing fire to generate earth? Although it is generally used in
the treatment of painful obstruction patterns where damp-
ness predominates, an important secondary indication is the
treatment of headache and dizziness due to internal wind
from yang deficiency. In Precepts for Physicians, the Ming dy-
nasty physician-scholar Yu Chang provided a clear analysis of
the disease dynamic that leads to such patterns:

According [to established practice] this formula treats patients
who are deficient in Kidney qi. When external wind enters the
Kidneys, it resembles a bird in a cave. Yin wind is dull but stops
at neither day nor night. As the wind avails itself of the turbid
yin qi within the Kidneys, it rebels and attacks the top. The per-
son will suffer from heaviness in the head and dizziness, which
are extremely difficult to endure. Because the Stomach qi is also
deficient and unable to discrminate the flavors, the formula
completely avoids the use of wind herbs [whose acrid nature
would deplete the qi]. Instead, it uses Aconiti Radix lateralis
preparata (zhi fur zi) to warm the water yin organ and Atrac-
tylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bdi zhi) and Glycyrrhizae
Radix (gan cdo) to warm the earth yin organ. If water and earth
are both warm, the turbid yin qi will always hurry downward
and the symptoms of heavy-headedness, dizziness, and lack of
interest in food will disappear.

Other indications for which this formula has been used in-
clude wind-stroke, and constipation and diarrhea due to gen-
eralized yang and qi deficiency in children. In fact, although
the source text explicitly mentions hard stools in the list of
symptoms associated with this pattern, it is not accepted by
contemporary practitioners as a necessary condition for pre-
scribing the formula. This is because the presence of cold in
the middle burner can also give rise to loose stools.

Comparison

> Vs. CINNAMON TWIG PLUS ACONITE ACCESSORY ROOT
Decocrion (gui zhi jid fu zi tang) & LICORICE AND
Aconite Accessory Root DECOCTION
(gan cdo fu zi tang)
All three formulas treat wind-dampness painful obstruction
that occurs against a background of yang deficiency. Cin-
namon Twig and Aconite Accessory Root Decoction (gui zhi
fu zi tang) patterns are characterized by body pain, inability
to rotate the body, and a floating, deficient, and rough pulse.
This formula focuses particularly on expelling wind and
pathogens that are primarily located in the exterior. Atracty-

lodes Macrocephalae and Aconite Accessory Root Decoction
(bai zhu fi zi tang) patterns present in a similar manner, but
with hard stools and a floating, thin, and moderate pulse.
This formula focuses particularly on transforming dampness
and on the muscles and flesh. Licorice and Aconite Accessory
Root Decoction (gan cdo fu zi tang) patterns are character-
ized by even more severe or deep-seated pain, inability to
flex or extend the joints, sweating, shortness of breath, and
urinary difficulty. This formula focuses on the joints and on
moderating and expelling wind-dampness.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders such as
degenerative joint disease and arthropathy, post-stroke debil-
ity, and pediatric diarrhea.

Modifications

* For wind-dampness painful obstruction with numbness
and loss of movement in the joints, add Mori Ramulus
(sang zhi) and Spatholobi Caulis (ji xue teng).

¢ For more severe internal dampness indicated by a thick,
white, and greasy tongue coating, substitute Atractylodis
Rhizoma (cdng zhu) for Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhi-
zoma (bdi zhi) and add Coicis Semen (yi yi ren).

* For sweating due to qi deficiency, add Codonopsis Radix
(dang shen).

FORMULAS THAT RESCUE
DEVASTATED YANG

The formulas in this section are used to treat debilitated yang
and exuberant yin with cold in both the exterior and interior.
In extreme cases, this may lead to exuberant yin repelling
yang, or upcast yang. Such patterns are characterized by cold
extremities, aversion to cold, fatigue, a desire to lie down and
curl up, clear, watery diarrhea, and a submerged, faint, and
almost imperceptible pulse. In severe cases, the patient will
break into a strong sweat that seems to pour out like water.
Only formulas that contain substances with strong warming
properties, such as Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu
2i), Cinnamomi Cortex (rou gui), Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan
jiang), Psoraleae Fructus (bu gt zhi), and Trigonelle Semen
(hi lu ba), are able to rescue the yang in such cases. Among
these, Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi) is the most
important herb because it is strongly warming, acrid, drying,
and enters all twelve channels.

Depending on the context, these chief herbs are combined
with four different types of deputies and assistants. In cases
of severe debility of the fire at the gate of vitality, or sudden
abandonment of yang, one should add herbs that tonify the
qi, such as Ginseng Radix (ren shen), Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan
cdo), or Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bdi zhu), be-
cause the force generated by acrid herbs alone is too light to
secure abandonment. Where the yin and yang separate or fail
to interpenetrate due to exuberance of yin cold in the interior,
one should add herbs that unblock the yang and open the
orifices, such as Allii fistulosi Bulbus (ceng bdi) or Moschus
(she xiang). In order to prevent yang abandonment, one can
also add astringent herbs like Schisandrae Fructus (wit wei
zi), Myristicae Semen (rou dou kou), or Halloysitum rubrum
(chi shi zhi). Where accumulation of yin cold leads to qi stag-
nation, one can add a small amount of gi-moving herbs like
Citri reticulatae Pericarpium (chen pi), Aucklandiae Radix
(mit xiang), or Toosendan Fructus (chuan lian zi) to promote
the dispersion of cold and facilitate the revival of yang.

frigid due to devastated yang. Its name literally means the ‘four

to the fact that the extremities curl up from the cold rather than
extend properly. Another view is that the yang qi disobeys its

Actions Rescues devastated yang, warms the middle burner,
| and stops diarrhea.

Indications

Extremely cold extremities, aversion to cold, curling up when
lying down, lethargy with a constant desire to sleep, vomiting,
diarrhea with undigested food particles, abdominal pain and
cold, lack of thirst, a pale tongue with a white, slippery coat-
ing, and a submerged and thin or faint pulse.


Formulas that Rescue Devastated Yang 275

This is a cold inversion pattern most typically associated
with a lesser yin disorder. Cold is a yin pathogenic influence
that readily injures the yang qi. The fire at the gate of vital-
ity, which is the foundation of the body’s yang qi, is respon-
sible for transmitting warmth to all the organs. When cold
invades the interior and injures this fire, its warming function
is inhibited, which is manifested in various signs of deficiency
and cold. The most typical of these are extreme cold in the
extremities, aversion to cold, curling up when lying down,
and lethargy with a constant desire to sleep.

The Spleen and Stomach, which transform food and flu-
ids into refined essence, depend on the fire at the gate of vital-
ity to carry out their respective functions. When it is deficient,
the middle burner is reduced to a ‘cauldron without a fire
underneath;’ thus it cannot digest, assimilate, transform, or
transport the essence of food and fluids. As a result, the clear
yang cannot ascend, nor can the turbid yin properly descend.
Vomiting, diarrhea with undigested food particles, and an
absence of thirst ensue. Because cold contracts, congeals, and
stagnates, congealed cold and qi stagnation causes pain and
cold in the abdomen.

The yang qi also nourishes the spirit. When the yang qi
is sufficient, the spirit will be vigorous, but when the spirit is
deprived of nourishment, it will weaken, which manifests as
lethargy and a desire to sleep. A pale tongue with a white, slip-
pery coating and a submerged or faint and thin pulse are also
indicative of yang deficiency with internal cold. The wording
of the source text makes clear that the pulse here is thin not
because the yin or blood is deficient, but because it is primar-
ily faint, implying that there is insufficient yang to move the
pulse, which therefore becomes thin. This interpretation fol-
lows a passage in Chapter 39 of Basic Questions: “The cold qi
enters into the channels and slows down [their flow]. They
trickle but do not move. [If cold] lodges outside of the blood
vessels, the blood will be lacking. If it lodges within the blood
vessels, the qi is obstructed.”

Analysis of Formula

The basic strategy for treating severe cold that has entered
deeply into the interior is outlined in Chapter 74 of Basic
Questions: “Cold pernicious qi in the interior is treated with
sweet, heating [herbs] assisted by bitter, acrid [herbs]” and,
“If a cold pernicious qi is victorious, it can be levelled by
means of acrid, heating [herbs].”

When the yang is debilitated and the yin flourishes, as
reflected in a faint pulse and frigid extremities, one must use
a strongly heating and acrid herb to break through the yin
and revive the yang. Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu
zi) serves this purpose and is therefore designated as the chief
herb in the formula. It is especially effective in warming and
stimulating the fire at the gate of vitality so that it dissemi-
nates throughout the body and reaches the extremities. In

Discourse on Tracing Back to the Source of [the Discussion] of
Cold Damage, Qian Huang notes:

Acrid and heating Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi)
goes directly to the lower burner to strongly tonify the true
yang at the gate of vitality. Therefore, it is able to treat cold
pathogens that rebel upward from the lower burner, assisting
the ascent of the clear yang, which rises to the four extremities,
As the yang returns, the qi warms, and the four limbs no longer
suffer from inversion frigidity.

The deputy, Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jidng), warms the
middle burner and eliminates cold, which strengthens the
Spleen’s functions of transforming and transporting food and
fluids. The chief and deputy ingredients work synergistically:
the deputy assists the chief in strengthening the fire at the
gate of vitality, while the chief assists the deputy in strength-
ening the yang of the middle burner. These herbs are used
together in order to realize the full potential of each. In fact,
it is traditionally said that Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata
(zhi fu zi) is not hot if it is used apart from Zingiberis Rhi-
zoma (gan jiang). The field of action of these two herbs is
also complementary. The chief ingredient warms the entire
body by traveling through all of the twelve channels, while
the focus of the deputy ingredient is primarily on the Spleen,
Stomach, and Lungs.

The assistant herb, Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata (zhi gan
cdo), augments the qi, strengthens the Spleen, reduces the tox-
icity of the chief ingredient, and moderates the drying prop-
erties of the chief and deputy ingredients. Being sweet, it also
provides a substratum to which the acrid and heating qi of
the chief and deputy herbs can attach in order to achieve their
intended functions without merely dissipating. This function
is so important to the overall effectiveness of the formula that
some physicians even consider Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo)
to be the chief herb (see COMMENTARY below).

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula is contraindicated in cases with true heat and
false cold characterized by cold extremities, thirst with a de-
sire to drink cool beverages, dark urine, and a red tongue
with a yellow coating.

Commentary

The significance of this formula lies in its ability to strength-
en the yang of both the gate of vitality and the middle burner.
Furthermore, it is formulated in such a way as to warm and
strengthen the yang without injuring the yin. This is impor-
tant here because the formula’s indications include vomiting
or diarrhea, both of which can injure the yin. The moderat-
ing and qi-augmenting qualities of Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan
ceo) make an important contribution to the efficacy of this
formula. In fact, it is listed first in the source text, and its dos-
age is as large or larger than that of the other ingredients.


276 Chapter 6 / Formulas that Warm Interior Cold

Both Cheng Wu-Ji, the famous Song-dynasty commentator
on the Discussion of Cold Damage, and the editors of the
Golden Mirror of the Medical Tradition therefore considered
Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo) to be the chief herb. The mod-
ern Shanghai physician Cheng Men-Xue admonished his stu-
dents “not to think lightly” of it because it lacked the apparent
power of the heating herbs.

The importance of this formula is demonstrated by the
fact that it is mentioned twelve times in Discussion of Cold
Damage. The scope of its use is succinctly summed up by the
Qing-dynasty physician Wang Zi-Jie in Selected Annotations
to Ancient Formulas from the Garden of Crimson Snow:

[This formula] can be used in patterns of all three yin warps

as well as one [i.e., the greater] yang warp [provided they] are
characterized by inversion [as the key symptom]. One employs
it in lesser yin [disorders] in order to rescue the yang of the
primal sea [i.e., the Kidneys]. In greater yin [disorders], one
uses it to warm cold within the yin organ [i.e., the Spleen].
Terminal yin [disorders characterized by] lack of warmth and
inversion where devastation of yang is threatening cannot be
helped without this [formula]. Finally, one also uses it in greater
yang [disorders] where inappropriate sweating has devastated
the yang.

Key Indicators

Wang Zi-Jie emphasizes that frigid extremities is the chief
indicator for this formula. According to the Qing-dynasty
physician Fei Bo-Xiong, the arms must be cold up to (or be-
yond) the elbows and the legs up to (or beyond) the knees to
warrant use of Frigid Extremities Decoction (si ni tang). This
type of disorder is called ‘inversion rebellion’ (Sk i#. jue ni) or
‘frigid extremities’ (2 %# si ni). Classical texts describe three
types of inversion (Jk jtie) disorders: emotional problems ac-
companied by a sensation of qi rushing upward from the ab-
domen to the chest; sudden fainting; and extreme cold in the
extremities. This formula is indicated only for the last type of
disorder. Furthermore, while the character %# 1 often refers
to a contrary flow of qi, as in rebellious qi, the term #9 i# s} ni
or ‘four rebellions’ refers to the symptom of frigid extremities,
which here is due to yang qi deficiency and internal cold.
The second most important symptom, according to Fei
Bo-Xiong, is the pulse, which must be submerged and thin
and faint. The modern physician Cheng Men-Xue concurs. In
Formulas in Verse from the Scholar’s Studio in Two Volumes,
he advises: “Whenever one sees a pulse that is faint and thin
[in a patient who is also] lethargic with a constant desire to
sleep, this is the manifestation of deficiency cold. You should
be decisive in [selecting this formula] without hesitation so
that later you do not regret having wasted an opportunity [for
successful treatment].” Note that the pulse here appears to
be thin because it is so weak. This is different from the pulse
associated with Tangkuei Decoction for Frigid Extremities
(dang gui si ni tang) patterns, discussed above, which can be

so thin as to become almost imperceptible. The root in the
first case is devasted yang unable to invigorate the blood,
while in the second, it is deficient blood invaded by cold.

Usage

The onset of these symptoms can be very acute and use of the
formula is documented for conditions like shock, myocar-
dial infarction, and severe blood loss. As often, however, the
formula is used for less severe disorders. The late 19th-cen-
tury physician Zheng Shou-Quan, for instance, observed that
cases of exhausted yang are relatively rare, and that treatment
in such cases is often unsuccessful in any event. Although he
considered this formula to be effective, he recommended that
it be used when the yang was merely deficient and not yet
exhausted.

This formula may also be used in treating conditions with
true cold and false heat. This is a fairly frequent occurrence
in clinical practice when exuberant yin in the interior forc-
es yang to float to the surface. Besides classical symptoms
like flushing, a dry throat, or a yellow tongue coating, one
may also observe severely high blood pressure or a raised
heart beat. Modern clinicians also use it for disorders such as
chronic inflammatory conditions with a yang-deficient pre-
sentation. When the false heat signs include a flushed face and
irritability, the decoction should be taken cool.

Aconiti Radix lateralis (fu zi)

There has been much debate among commentators regarding
both the type of Aconiti Radix lateralis (ft zi) to be used and
its dosage. Traditionally-minded physicians like Cheng Men-
Xue point out that in Discussions of Cold Damage, Zhang
Zhong-Jing uses untreated Aconiti Radix lateralis (ft zi) to
treat serious and acute disorders but that its toxicity is mod-
erated both by the use of Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jidng) and
Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo), as well as by extended boil-
ing. For this reason, Cheng Men-Xue recommends that it
also be used untreated in this formula. However, according
to Chinese laws governing poisons, the unprepared herb is
not available at all except through a very small number of
herb preparation factories, and then only by special prescrip-
tion. This means that at present, the unprepared herb is no
longer used, except in some topical preparations. Physicians
in contemporary China consider 6-10g to be the standard
dosage for Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi) in this
formula, but may increase it up to 150g for very acute cases.
