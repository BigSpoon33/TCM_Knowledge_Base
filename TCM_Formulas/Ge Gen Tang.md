This is the original formula, which was later modified by Cheng
Guo-Peng to construct the principal formula. In contrast to this later
modification, the original formula focuses equally on regulating the
qi and releasing the exterior. It is therefore indicated for treating ex-
terior wind-cold that occurs in conjunction with gi constraint in
the interior. This can occur when exterior wind-cold obstructs the
spreading of Lung qi, which in turn obstructs the qi mechanism of
the Spleen and Stomach. It can also occur when patients with preex-
isting constraint of the qi dynamic encounter a wind-cold pathogen
but fail to engage with it forcefully because of the constraint. This
produces such symptoms as lack of appetite, belching, and focal
distention and a stifling sensation in the chest and epigastrium. The
thin, white tongue coating and floating pulse reflect the presence of
cold in the exterior.

30 Chapter 1 / Formulas that Release the Exterior

Note: No dosages are listed in the source text; the amounts shown
here reflect modern usage.

Disperses pathogens and releases them from the exterior. Directs
qi downward and transforms phlegm. In the source text, this formula
is said to treat the onset of pox disorders that present with wheez-
ing due to “a wind-cold pathogen visiting the Lung.” At present, this
formula is applied to wind-cold exterior patterns that present with
cough, nasal congestion, low fever, headache, and wheezing. It is pri-
marily used to treat the initial stage of this pattern and to specifically
address chills as well as cough or wheezing; it can be thought of as
a mild Ephedra Decoction (md hudng tang) that is appropriate for
weak patients or mild conditions. It is also often combined with some
or all of the ingredients of Arrest Wheezing Decoction (ding chudn
tang), discussed in Chapter 12, to treat cold asthmatic episodes that
are brought on by a wind-cold attack. Biomedical disease categories
to which this formula can be applied include bronchitis, asthma, and
influenza where wheezing, cough, and chills are present.

Note that one of the major formulas to treat dryness, discussed
in Chapter 15, has the similar name of Apricot Kernel and Perilla
Leaf Powder (xing se sdn). That formula first appeared in Systematic
Differentiation of Warm Pathogen Diseases and was written approxi-
mately 50 years after this one, in 1798.

Directs Lung qi downward, disseminates Lung qi, eases coughs,
transforms phlegm, and nourishes the Lung. For wind-cold exterior
patterns that present with nasal congestion, runny nose, headache,
fever, cough with thin sputum, or wheezing and thoracic fullness. It
is also used for patients who complain of sneezing and aversion to
drafts.

This formula can be seen as a variation of Apricot and Perilla
Drink (xing si yin). Both formulas treat wind-cold patterns that
present with cough or wheezing. Calm Coughing Pill (ning sou wan)
contains fewer herbs to release pathogens from the exterior and also
contains Poria (fii ling) to supplement the Spleen. This makes it bet-
ter suited for lingering coughs, while Apricot and Perilla Drink (xing
sii yin) is better for acute conditions. Both formulas use the perillia
plant, but Calm Coughing Pill (ning sou wan) uses the seed, Perillae
Fructus (zi sii zi), and thus focuses on rebellious Lung qi rather than
on the exterior wind-cold pathogen.

As a prepared medicine, the ground herbs are mixed with a de-

coction of Setariae (Oryzae) Fructus germinatus (gd yd) and made
into a pill. The dosages above reflect the common amounts used at
present for decoctions.

Note: This is a modification of a formula that was first published
in Revised Popular Guide to the Discussion of Cold-induced Disorders.
That formula included Coicis Semen (yi yi ren) and Adenophorae
Radix (ndn sha shen) and used Fritillariae cirrhosae Bulbus (chudn
bei mi) instead of Fritillariae thunbergii Bulbus (zhe bei mi).

This formula, when not used in pill form, is often modified as
follows:

* For chronic cough, add Adenophorae Radix (ndn sha shen) and
Coicis Semen (yi yi ren).

* For wind-cold patterns that are beginning to engender Lung heat,
add Scutellariae Radix (hudng qin) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma
(zhi mui).

¢ For acute wind-cold with strong chills and lack of sweating, add
Ephedrae Herba (md hudng) or combine with Canopy Powder
(hud gai sen).

¢ For copious sputum, remove Dendrobii Herba (she hu) and in-
crease the dosage of Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhi ban xia)
and Citri reticulatae Exocarpium rubrum (ju heng).

* For chronic painful coughing, add Persicae Semen (tdo ren).

2 Actions Releases pathogens from the exterior, regulates the qi,
§ disseminates the Lung qi, and relieves cough

Indications

Epidemic disorders and wind-cold patterns that present
with internal qi stagnation. Symptoms include headache, sti-
fling oppression and focal distention in the chest, absence of
sweating, fever, cough, nasal congestion, and a low voice. The
tongue coating is thin and white. It is also sometimes applied


Formulas that Release Exterior Wind-Cold 31

to the treatment of wind-cold-damp painful obstruction.

Headache, fever, chills, and the absence of sweating are
all due to exterior wind. Focal distention and a stifling op-
pression in the chest reflect qi stagnation and damp obstruc-
tion. The qi and fluids both rely on the free flow in the Triple
Burner to properly ascend and descend. The ability of the
protective qi to move in the Triple Burner is dependent on
the Lung’s ability to clarify and descend, the Liver’s capacity
to dredge and drain, and the Spleen-Stomach’s functions of
raising, ascending, and transporting. In patients who already
suffer from a tendency toward qi stagnation, an externally-
contracted pathogen immediately hinders the Lung’s ability
to disseminate, the Spleen’s ability to transport, and the Liv-
er’s ability to dredge. The resulting stagnation of qi hinders
the flow of fluids, and the obstruction of qi and fluids further
adds to the stagnation. The result is a situation where one
suffers simultaneously from externally-contracted wind-cold
and internal qi stagnation. Stifling oppression in the chest
and focal distention are signs of the stagnant obstruction of
qi and fluids. The tongue coating being thin and white, rather
than greasy, shows that the root cause is primarily qi stagna-
tion and not dampness.

Analysis of Formula

This is another formula built on the basis of Cyperus and
Perilla Leaf Powder (xiang sit sdn), which aims at simultane-
ously dispersing wind-cold from the exterior while opening
stagnant qi in the interior. The chief ingredient, Perillae Fo-
lium (zi sit ye), is acrid and warm. It opens obstructed Lung
qi, disseminates qi in the body’s exterior, and warms and dis-
perses the cold pathogen that fetters the exterior. By dispers-
ing the cold pathogen and opening the interstices, Perillae
Folium (zi sii ye) frees the Lung qi, fluids, and protective qi
to discharge naturally to the body’s exterior and thus relieves
the symptoms of exterior patterns such as chills and fever
and the absence of sweating. In addition, Perillae Folium (zi
si ye) arouses the Spleen and transforms dampness, thus
helping to eliminate focal distention and the stifling oppres-
sion in the chest. One deputy, Citri reticulatae Pericarpium
(chen pi), assists Perillae Folium (zi sii ye) in moving the qi
and transforming dampness. Another deputy, Cyperi Rhi-
zoma (xiang fi), supported by Citri reticulatae Pericarpium
(chen pi), regulates the qi and dredges the Liver, allowing it
to return to its preferred state of orderly reaching. Perillae
Folium (zi sii ye), Citri reticulatae Pericarpium (chen pi), and
Cyperi Rhizoma (xidng fu) as a group promote the free flow
of qi through the three burners.

The last two deputies, Ephedrae Herba (md hudng) and
Puerariae Radix (ge gen), work with Perillae Folium (zi sa ye)
to release pathogens from the body’s exterior. One assistant,
Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng md), works with Puerariae Ra-
dix (ge gen} to ascend and disperse; they release the muscle

layer. The deputies, Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chudn xidng),
which moves the qi within the blood, and Angelicae dahuri-
cae Radix (bdi zhi), work together with the ascending herbs,
Puerariae Radix (ge gen) and Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng
md), to treat wind-cold headache and nasal congestion. The
final deputy, Paeoniae Radix rubra (chi shdo), adjusts and
connects yin and yang, allowing the heat from internal stasis
to move to the exterior where it is released. This herb and Ch-
uanxiong Rhizoma (chudn xieng) also move the blood.

The remaining ingredients are envoys. Acrid and warm
Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jiang) helps Ephedrae
Herba (md hudng) and Perillae Folium (zi sii ye) dispel the
wind-cold pathogen from the exterior. Glycyrrhizae Radix
preparata (zhi gan cdo) tonifies and harmonizes the middle
and also harmonizes the various groups of ingredients. With
the exception of this herb, every ingredient fills one or more
of three roles: releasing wind-cold from the exterior; regulat-
ing the qi in the upper, middle, or lower burner; and relieving
specific symptoms such as headache or nasal congestion.

Commentary

Formulary of the Pharmacy Service for Benefiting the People
in the Taiping Era groups Ten-Miracle Decoction (shi shen
tang) with others that treat damage from cold. It is specifi-
cally listed to “treat unseasonable weather that brings on
fast spreading epidemics which affect many people. [It treats
these] without [the need of] inquiring into [whether] the af-
fliction [belongs to] yin or yang. Also, it can treat wind-cold-
damp painful obstruction.” The text goes on to say that the
formula is safe for the treatment of cold damage in pregnant
women as well as the old and young, irrespective of whether
the disorder is internal or external.

Since this formula has been on record since the Song dy-
nasty, there has been ample time for practitioners to develop
other uses for it and to refine the uses set forth in the source
text. The most common use for the formula is in the treatment
of wind-cold patterns that occur in the presence of internal qi
stagnation. Golden Mirror of the Medical Tradition suggests
this use when it notes that the formula can “discharge external
cold and soothe internal gi constraint to treat a condition
termed cold qi disease. [It] has the ability to warm the chan-
nels and enable the free flow of qi.”

The Ming-dynasty text Achieving Longevity by Guarding
the Seurce, and others, list Ten-Miracle Decaction (shi shen
tang) for epidemic pox disorders, to express papules. Puer-
ariae Radix (ge gen) and Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng md) are
used for this purpose, as in Cimicifuga and Kudzu Decoction
(sheng md ge gen tang). The formula is also mentioned in sev-
eral texts for the treatment of febrile epidemic disorders, such
as massive head febrile disorder.

The source text’s advice that the formula is safe for chil-
dren and pregnant women prompted its recommendation


32 Chapter 1 / Formulas that Release the Exterior

in Posthumous Manuscript from [Bian Que in] Handan for
treating serious wind-cold disorders during pregnancy, and
in Guide to Pediatrics for pediatric fevers due to wind-cold
with body aches, headache, chills, and the absence of sweat-
ing.

Although references to Ten-Miracle Decoction (shi shen
tang) fill the classical literature, its use seems to have lost
popularity in modern China. This is reflected in its omission
from modern teaching textbooks in the Peoples Republic.
This loss of esteem may be related to the sentiments expressed
by the Ming-dynasty physician Wu Shou, who urged caution
when using this formula because he felt that its yang bright-
ness herbs, Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng md) and Puerariae
Radix (ge gen), when used to treat greater yang disorders,
would lead wind-cold pathogens deeper, into the yang bright-
ness. However, the formula is still frequently used in Taiwan
and Japan for initial-stage wind-cold patterns. Interestingly,
a key use of Ten-Miracle Decoction (shi shen tang) in those
places as well as in the Peoples Republic is as a preventative to
epidemic disorders. The formula’s ability to promote the free
flow of qi in the interior and exterior of the body is viewed
as an effective way to enhance the body’s protective qi and
ward off illness. For this purpose, sources generally suggest a
smaller dose of 3-6g per day of the decocted powder.

Comparison

> Vs. AUGMENTED CYPERUS AND PERILLA LEAF POWDER
(jid wei xiang sit san)

Both formulas regulate the qi and release pathogens from the

exterior. However, because Augmented Cyperus and Perilla

Leaf Powder (jia wei xiding sti san) does both of these things
in a milder fashion, it is appropriate for less severe patterns.

Actions Discharges and disperses wind-cold, disseminates and

| and calms wheezing

Indications

Wind-cold exterior patterns with chills, fever, cough with co-
pious sputum, nasal congestion, deep and low voice, headache,
clouded vision, fullness and oppression in the chest and dia-
phragm, a puffy tongue with tooth marks and a greasy, white
coating, and a floating pulse. It is also specifically indicated for
toothache with a swollen tongue due to wind-cold invasion.

Wind-cold exterior patterns present with chills because
the protective level is compromised. Fever results from the
struggle between the normal qi and the pathogen. The dis-
ruption to the flow of Lung qi that results from the fettering
of the Lungs by wind-cold gives rise to a deep and low voice,
as well as fullness and oppression in the chest and diaphragm.
The nose is the opening of the Lung and thus becomes con-
gested as the Lung qi is fettered. Headache and clouded vision
result from the obstruction in the Lung that blocks the flow of
clear qi to the upper body.
