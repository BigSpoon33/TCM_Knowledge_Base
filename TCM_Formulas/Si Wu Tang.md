## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
"Mother of all blood formulas" - the foundation for treating blood deficiency in TCM. The four herbs work in perfect harmony: two nourish (Dang Gui, Shu Di), one preserves (Bai Shao), one moves (Chuan Xiong). Represents the classic approach to building blood without causing stagnation.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows hematopoietic effects, hormone-regulating properties, and circulation-improving actions. Dang Gui contains ferulic acid and ligustilide with blood-building effects. Shu Di provides iron and other minerals. Studies show benefits for anemia and menstrual disorders.

### Clinical Experience
Essential formula for women with blood deficiency. Often combined with other formulas rather than used alone. Takes 4-8 weeks to see full blood-building effects. Best results with adequate rest and nutrition.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, can be taken as pills for long-term use
**Timing**: Between meals for best absorption
**Duration**: 3-6 months for chronic blood deficiency
