## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
Classic formula that demonstrates the principle "treat the opposite" - using Ban Xia (warm, drying) within a yin-nourishing formula. The small amount of Ban Xia descends rebellious qi without overwhelming the yin-nourishing action. Essential for chronic stomach conditions with both dryness and qi rebellion.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows gastroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-emetic effects. Mai Men Dong contains saponins and polysaccharides that protect gastric mucosa and promote healing. Studies demonstrate benefits in chronic gastritis, GERD, and chemotherapy-induced nausea. The combination helps restore normal gastric function.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for chronic stomach problems in people with thin constitution who tend toward dryness. Particularly effective for persistent nausea, chronic gastritis, and dry cough that stems from stomach-lung connection. Often provides relief within days while building long-term stomach health.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, add Geng Mi last 15 minutes of cooking
**Timing**: Between meals, small frequent doses for severe nausea
**Duration**: 2-8 weeks for chronic conditions, adjust based on response
