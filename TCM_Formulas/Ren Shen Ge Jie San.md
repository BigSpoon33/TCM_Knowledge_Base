688 Chapter 16 / Formulas that Expel Dampness

Calm the Stomach Powder (ping wei san) is a sagely formula
for treating the Spleen and Stomach. It facilitates the resolution
of dampness, transforms focal distention, disperses distention,
and harmonizes the middle. It also treats unseasonal epidemics
[due to] miasmatic qi. It is drying but not violently [so]. Hence,
it is the primary formula for reducing and guiding out.

If, as Fei Bo-Xiong suggests, the primary intention of the
formula is to guide out excess and fullness in order to open
the qi dynamic, the many diverse uses for which the formula
has been employed over the centuries are more easily under-
stood. Besides the treatment of various digestive disorders,
these include amenorrhea, the facilitation of labor, insomnia,
chronic cough, coronary artery disease, male impotence, and
damp-type eczema.

There has long been a debate in the literature about
whether the dampness for which this formula is intended
is primarily due to excess (as described above) or to Spleen
deficiency. Most commentators have argued that if the for-
mula were designed to treat dampness due to Spleen defi-
ciency, Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bdi zhu),
which is better suited for strengthening the Spleen, would
have been used in place of Atractylodis Rhizoma (cang zhi).
For a formula in which this substitution is made to focus
more on the deficient aspects of the presentation, see MODI-
FICATIONS below.

Biomedical Indications

to treat a wide variety of biomedically-defined disorders.
These can be divided into the following groups:

¢ Digestive disorders such as peptic ulcer, chronic gastritis,
chronic colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal ob-
struction, infantile diarrhea, and infectious hepatitis

syndrome, and cervicitis.

This formula has also been used for eczema, pertussis, re-
duced libido in men, erectile dysfunction, and halitosis.
