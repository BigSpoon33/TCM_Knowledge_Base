of the postnatal qi. Entering the Liver channel, it dredges
Liver constraint, promoting the movement of qi and stopping
pain, all of which are aspects of this pattern. The other assis-
tant, Schisandrae Fructus (wt wei zi), is a strong, warm, and
astringent herb that strengthens the deputy’s ability to bind
up the Intestines. It also works synergistically with Evodiae
Fructus (wii zhi yui), one herb being warm, acrid, drying, and
strongly dispersing, the other sour, sweet, and astringent. The
envoys, which are added to the decoction but removed before
the pills are made, include Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng
jiang), which disperses cold and activates the metabolism
of water, and Jujubae Fructus (da zdo), which nourishes the
Spleen and Stomach.

When the Spleen and Kidneys are warmed and the Large
Intestine is stabilized, the transformation and transportation
of foodstuffs will resume, and the diarrhea will stop.

Cautions and Contraindications

Without modification, this formula should not be used if
there is accumulation or stagnation in the Stomach or In-
testines. One should also avoid raw or cooling foods while
taking this formula.

Commentary

This formula is very effective for daybreak diarrhea. It was
devised by the Ming-dynasty physician Xue Ji, a strong pro-
ponent of warming and tonification who emphasized organ
systems as core rubrics in pattern differentiation. Like many
other physicians associated with this current of thought, Xue
Ji focused particularly on the Spleen and Kidneys as the two
organ systems whose physiological agencies he viewed as most
closely intertwined with the functions of the original yang.
Thus, the original indications of this formula were “deficiency
and frailty of Spleen and Kidneys, soft stools, and disinter-
est in food, [and] also patterns [characterized] by diarrhea
and abdominal pain.” To treat this pattern, Xue combined
two existing formulas from Xu Shu-Wei’s 12th-century book,
Formulas of Universal Benefit from My Practice: Two-Miracle
Pill (er shen wen), composed of Psoraleae Fructus (bi git zhi)
and Myristicae Semen (rou dou kou), and Schisandra Pill (wi
wei zi san), composed of Evodiae Fructus (wu zhit yti) and
Schisandrae Fructus (wit wei zi). The first of these formulas
treated “deficiency and frailty of Spleen and Kidneys with to-
tal disinterest in food,’ the second “Kidney diarrhea,’ a term
equated by some authors with daybreak diarrhea. It is via this
association that the new formula came to be regarded as the
exemplar for the treatment of this disorder.

Our brief genealogy of Four-Miracle Pill (si shen wan)
allows two important observations regarding the use of this
formula in the clinic. First, its use is not limited in any strict
sense to daybreak diarrhea, but extends more widely to pat-
terns presenting with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and lack of

appetite. All of these reflect deficiency of the fire at the gate of
vitality that extends, in particular, to the Spleen and Kidneys.
Secondly, inasmuch as the formula does treat daybreak diar-
thea, its use of Evodiae Fructus (wi zhii yu) and Schisandrae
Fructus (wii wei zi) is of particular significance. The joint ac-
tion of these herbs, which combine acrid and warming disper-
sion with sweet and sour restraining, is a classic strategy for
tonifying the function of constrained Liver yang attributable
to cold from deficiency. There is no particular reason why di-
arrhea due to Kidney and Spleen yang deficiency should only
occur at daybreak. It is more likely that such deficiency will
manifest with diarrhea that has no fixed pattern or that is ag-
gravated by the intake of cold foods. An understanding of the
Liver’s role in the dissemination of ministerial fire is needed
to fully grasp the disease dynamic that leads to daybreak di-
arrhea (i.e., diarrhea that only occurs at this time).

If the Kidney is in control of the storage and release
(opening and closing) of the ministerial fire produced in the
gate of vitality, the Liver is in charge of its dispersal through-
out the three burners. If this dispersal is constrained by Liver
deficiency, it will manifest in a manner typical of Liver wood
pathology: suddenly, rebelliously, and at a moment that re-
flects the transformation of yin into yang corresponding to
the terminal yin. All of these are present in daybreak diarrhea.
In addition, the Chinese medical literature associates day-
break diarrhea with other Liver-related problems: food and
alcohol accumulation, for instance, as well as Liver fire. Many
commentators, too, have been explicit about the contribution
of Liver constraint to the pattern treated by Four-Miracle Pill
(si shen wan). Ke Qin’s discussion in Golden Mirror of the
Medical Tradition is one of the most perceptive:

Diarrhea is an abdominal disorder, and the abdomen is where
all three yin meet. A loss of regulation in any one organ can lead
to diarrhea. Therefore, Zhang Zhong-Jing devised formulas that
master diarrhea from [disorders] of the three yin. ... However,
even if for one organ there are six different strategies, when all
three organs connect with each other [in causing the problem],
it would remain for a long time without ever being cured, such
as the symptom of having diarrhea after the first watch [i.e.,
after 1 A.M.]. [The treatment methods] had not yet reached
this [problem].

Now, from the time the cock crows to daybreak, [although]
the sky is dark, it is {the time] of yang within the yin. When the
yang qi should arrive but does not, a deficient pathogen is able
to remain without being expelled, causing diarrhea at dawn.
This has four reasons: first, a deficient Spleen unable to control
water; second, a deficient Kidney unable to move water; third,
frail fire at the gate of vitality unable to generate earth; fourth, a
lesser yang whose qi is too deficient to spread out. Acting as an
assistant, the acridity and warmth of Evodiae Fructus (wi zhi
yt) is used to expedite the propensity that the Liver wood has
to disperse, thereby opening the way for water qi to propagate
[allowing the body] to receive spring’s generation.

Over the centuries, physicians developed the formula further
by following three basic strategies:


Formulas that Bind Up the Intestines and Secure Abandoned Conditions 431

* Add herbs to warm the Kidneys and augment fire, such as
Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fit zi), Zingiberis Rhi-
zoma preparata (pdo jidng), Piperis longi Fructus (bi bd),
Sulfur (lid hudng), or Zanthoxyli Pericarpium (hud jido).

Add herbs to warm the middle and disperse cold, such as
Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jidng), Aucklandiae Radix (mi
xiang), or Foeniculi Fructus (xido hut xiang).

Add herbs that warm the Kidneys and tonify the Spleen,
such as Ginseng Radix (ren shen), Atractylodis macroceph-
alae Rhizoma (bdi zhti), Morindae officinalis Radix (ba ji
tian), and Poria (fui ling).

With these and similar additions, the formule’s range of in-
dications has been much expanded to treat loss of other es-
sences, such as excessive urination or sweating, and other
symptoms manifesting at daybreak, such as asthma, sweating,
headache, low back pain, fever, cramps, and abdominal pain.
The key, as always, is a correct understanding of the underly-
ing pathodynamic. A pale tongue with a white coating, and a
submerged, forceless pulse will be key markers in the clinic.

Comparisons

> Vs. True Man’s DECOCTION TO NOURISH THE ORGANS
(zhen ren yang zang tang)

Both of these formulas are warming and are used to treat
chronic diarrhea associated with cold and deficiency of the
Spleen and Kidneys. They differ in their focus on the middle
and lower burner, respectively, and also in the relative weight
placed on binding and warming properties. True Man’s De-
coction to Nourish the Organs (zhen ren ydng zang tang)
focuses primarily on stopping excessive bowel movements.
Secondarily, it tonifies and warms the middle burner qi and
also tonifies the blood. It is therefore the formula of choice for
uncontrollable bowel movements associated with deficiency,
irrespective of when they occur. By contrast, Four-Miracle
Pill (si shen wan) is primarily a warming formula that aug-
ments the fire at the gate of vitality and its dissemination to
the middle burner. Astringent herbs are used only as assis-
tants. The formula is thus used primarily for early morning
diarrhea, but also for other types of leakage due to insuffi-
cient fire at the gate of vitality.

> Vs. GINSENG, Porta, AND WHITE ATRACTYLODES
Powper (shen ling bdi zhu san)

Both of these are important formulas for treating diarrhea,
but they can be differentiated in terms of their focus on qi
versus yang deficiency. Ginseng, Poria, and White Atracty-
lodes Powder (shen ling bdi zhti san) treats patterns of defi-
ciency where Spleen earth is encumbered by phlegm-damp-
ness. Here the stools will be soft or may even contain phlegm,
and symptoms worsen in relation to dietary irregularities or

exhaustion. Systemic symptoms include fatigue, poor appe-
tite, and weak muscles. By contrast, Four-Miracle Pill (si shen
wdn) augments the fire at the gate of vitality in order to treat
the diarrhea associated with Kidney and Spleen yang defi-
ciency. Diarrhea in these cases is often watery and contains
undigested food. The patient will be cold and tired.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
chronic colitis, chronic dysentery, irritable bowel syndrome,
tuberculosis of the colon, allergic colitis, and lower back
pain.

The method of preparation is identical to that of the principal for-
mula. Tonifies the Kidneys, reinforces the yang, regulates the Spleen
qi, and stops diarrhea. For chronic diarrhea or daybreak diarrhea
due to cold from deficiency of the Spleen and Kidneys with stagna-
tion of the middle qi. In contrast to the principal formula, this is for
conditions with more severe abdominal pain. In Discussion of Medi-
cal Formulas, the Qing-dynasty physician Fei Bo-Xiong succinctly
explained its differences from the principal formula:

daily [activity]. It steams the Spleen and Stomach to transport
and transform the food. For Kidney diarrhea, Two- Miracle Pill

(er shen wan) is appropriate. In case of Spleen diarrhea with hy-
peractive wood controlling earth, Evodiae Fructus (wii zhi yt)
is able to disperse the qi of the terminal yin. Therefore, it can be
used to curb wood. If that is not the case, then there is noth-

ing better than removing Schisandrae Fructus (wti wei zi) and
Evodiae Fructus (wii zhi yu) and replacing them with Foeniculi
Fructus (xido hui xing) and Aucklandiae Radix (mii xiang).

Halt the Carts Pill

zhi che wan

Within Mahayana Buddhism, the three types of Buddha corre-
spond to different programs of skillful means (upaya) or expedi-
ent practices, Chapter 3 of the Lotus Sutra compares the three
types of Buddha to three carts, namely, a goat cart, a deer cart,
and an ox cart. Some authors in the history of Chinese medicine
took up this idea and linked the three carts to the three burners
when referring to the transformative movement of essence, qi,
and spirit in the body. This formula treats dysenteric disorders
due to problems in the qi dynamic, expressed in terms of the
uncontrolled movement of the three carts, leading to leakage
from the carts.

Indications

Discharge of blood and pus from the bowels (blood and pus
can be mixed up with each other) that comes and goes, te-
nesmus, continuous abdominal pain, irritability of the chest,
a red tongue with little coating, and a thin, rapid pulse.

This is chronic or intermittent dysenteric disorder due
to damp-heat that has not been eliminated and gradually
damages both the yin and yang. Damp-heat that remains in
the Intestines for a long period of time leads to stagnation of
qi and stasis of blood. These various pathogens intermingle,
causing the discharge of blood and pus from the bowels as
well as tenesmus. Chronic or intermittent dysenteric disorders
invariably damage the blood and yin, and, over the long term,
the Spleen yang as well. The former manifests as irritability, a
red tongue with little coating, and a thin and rapid pulse. The
latter manifests as continuous abdominal pain due to failure
of the yang to warm and move the Spleen qi.

Analysis of Formula

The pattern treated by this formula is one of excess compli-
cated by deficiency, where the chronic retention of damp-
heat has led to deficiency of the yang qi and yin blood. To
treat this pattern, the formula combines four strategies from
Basic Questions: cool what is hot, disperse what has clumped,
restrain what has dispersed, and tonify what is deficient. Its
chief herb is bitter and cooling Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng
lidn), which drains fire and dries dampness, making it a key
herb in the treatment of dysenteric disorders. There are two
deputies. The first is Asini Corii Colla (e jiao), which enriches
the yin and nourishes the blood, and is described in Compre-
hensive Outline of the Materia Medica as treating “Intestinal
wind and dysenteric diarrhea.” The second is Angelicae si-
nensis Radix (dang gui), which nourishes and harmonizes the
blood, and, according to Delving into the Description of the
Materia Medica, “stops hot dysenteric disorders and abdomi-
nal pain.” Acting synergistically, the two deputies nourish the
blood and support the normal qi, as well as prevent the bitter,
drying Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn) from further damag-
ing the yin. Acrid, warming Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jiang)
serves as an assistant to warm the middle, expel dampness,
and supports the normal qi. In combination with Coptidis
Rhizoma (hudng lidn), it forms a synergistic pair in which
its bitterness directs the turbid qi downward, and its acridity
raises the clear and also balances both excessive cooling and
heating. Mature vinegar, added in the production of the pills,
serves as an envoy and adds an astringent quality.

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula is contraindicated for the initial stages of a dy-
senteric disorder, where treatment should focus on eliminat-
ing the pathogenic qi. The source text advises to avoid pork,
cold beverages, and greasy food while taking this formula.

Commentary

This formula can be viewed as a variation of Pinellia Decoc-
tion to Drain the Epigastrium (ban xid xie xin tang) or Mume
Pill (wit mei wan), both of which combine acrid, warming
Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jidng) with bitter, cooling Coptidis
Rhizoma (hudng lidn) to treat a variety of Intestinal patterns,
including dysenteric disorders.

Over the centuries, different texts have published contra-
dictory information about the type of dysenteric disorder for
which this formula is indicated. These include cold (Impor-
tant Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces), mixed cold
and heat (Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library), heat
from deficiency (Convenient Reader of Established Formulas),
and “all kinds of dysenteric disorders” (Formulary of the Phar-
macy Service for Benefiting the People in the Taiping Era).

One elegant approach to this formula that focuses on
the qi dynamic is described by Zhang Lu in Extension of the
