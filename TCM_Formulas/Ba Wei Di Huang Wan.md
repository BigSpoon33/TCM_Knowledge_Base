This formula represents the classical approach to "yang within yin" - using yin-nourishing herbs as the foundation while adding yang-warming herbs to create balanced kidney tonification. Essential for kidney yang deficiency patterns.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows hormone-regulating, anti-aging, and immune-supporting effects. The combination demonstrates benefits for reproductive health, thyroid function, and age-related decline. Studies show potential benefits for infertility, chronic fatigue, and hypothyroidism.

### Clinical Experience
Essential formula for reproductive disorders and chronic fatigue with cold constitution. Particularly effective for people over 40 with declining energy and reproductive function. Often requires 3-6 months for full benefits. Best combined with lifestyle modifications to support yang qi.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: 6-9g granules twice daily, or decoct above doses twice daily
**Preparation**: Usually taken as pills for long-term use, decoction for acute conditions
**Timing**: Morning and evening, preferably on empty stomach
**Duration**: 3-6 months minimum for reproductive and chronic conditions
