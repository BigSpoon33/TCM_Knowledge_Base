### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows neuroprotective, circulation-improving, and anti-inflammatory effects. Huang Qi contains compounds that protect neurons and improve blood flow. Studies demonstrate efficacy in stroke recovery, neuropathy, and circulation disorders.

### Clinical Experience
Essential formula for stroke rehabilitation and neurological recovery. Particularly effective when started after acute phase. Often used long-term for chronic neurological conditions. Best results with rehabilitation therapy and lifestyle modifications.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 9-12g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, cook Huang Qi first for 30 minutes
**Timing**: Between meals for best absorption
**Duration**: 3-6 months for acute recovery, longer for chronic conditions
