Actions Enriches the yin, causes fire to descend, eliminates
irritability, and calms the spirit

w

Indications

Irritability with a sensation of heat in the chest, insomnia,
palpitations with anxiety, a red tongue with a dry, yellow
coating, and a thin, rapid pulse. There may also be sores on
the tongue or in the mouth.

This is a so-called heat transformation (341% re hua) pat-
tern in the lesser yin warp of a cold damage disorder. The
lesser yin corresponds to the Kidneys, which govern the flu-
ids and store the essence, and the Heart, which governs the
blood vessels. When pathogenic heat enters the lesser yin,
it consumes the yin fluids, blood, and essence. This results
in a pattern characterized by excess heat at the qi level (the
heat pathogen usually enters via the Stomach or Intestines)
combined with deficiency of yin and blood. The presence of
qi-aspect pathogenic heat is reflected in the red tongue with
a dry, yellow coating, while the thin, rapid pulse indicates

that the yin has already been damaged. Lesser-yin water (the
Kidneys) is no longer able to properly control lesser-yin fire
(the Heart). This leads to a sensation of heat in the chest and
symptoms of a disturbed spirit: palpitations with anxiety, ir-
ritability, and insomnia characterized by an inability of the
patient to calmly lie down. Sores in the mouth and on the
tongue are also a sign of pathogenic heat in the Heart.

Analysis of Formula

To treat a pattern characterized by heat excess and blood
deficiency whose symptoms predominantly manifest in the
Heart lesser yin, this formula utilizes a strategy of directing
fire downward by means of bitter, cooling herbs while simul-
taneously nourishing the yin and blood with sweet, salty, and
sour substances. The chief ingredients are the bitter, cooling
Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn), which directly clears fire
from the Heart and thereby calms the spirit, and the sweet
and neutral Asini Corii Colla (e jido), which indirectly con-
trols the Heart fire by enriching the yin and nourishing the
blood. Together, they facilitate interaction between water and
fire to effectively treat the root and branch of this pattern.
The deputies are bitter and cooling Scutellariae Radix (hudng
gin), which drains heat from the upper burner and the Intes-
tines to assist Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn) in directing fire
downward, and sour and cooling Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi
shdo), which assists Asini Corii Colla (e jido) in enriching
and retaining the yin to harmonize the functions of the qi
and also both of the heat-draining herbs in controlling the
yang, The assistant and envoy is sweet and balanced egg yolk
(ji zi hudng), which enters the Heart and Kidneys, tonifies the
yin and blood, and resolves heat toxicity. It assists the heat-
draining herbs in eliminating the pathogen while protecting
against their drying properties, but also acts in concert with
the blood-tonifying substances to enrich the yin.

Commentary

Like Gardenia and Prepared Soybean Decoction (zhi zi chi
tang), discussed in Chapter 4, and Sour Jujube Decoction
(sudn zdo ren tang), discussed above, this formula treats a
form of deficiency irritability ( ‘Axi fan). This is a disorder
characterized by symptoms like vexation, restlessness, insom-
nia, and subjective sensations of fullness in the chest indicat-
ing the presence of pathogenic heat. Such heat represents a
local excess, but unlike patterns where the heat has led to
clumping of body fluids or other substances, it has ‘no form,
‘Deficiency’ in this context thus does not refer primarily to
deficiency of qi or essence, but functions as a designator that
refers to a class of disorders in which the pathodynamic does
not manifest with palpable excess or fullness.

In the conditions treated by this formula, the heat will
tend to be of external origin (including alcohol, sugar, or
other foodstuffs that generate heat). Hence, even though the


470 Chapter 10 / Formulas that Calm the Spirit

patient will show signs of blood and yin deficiency, these are
secondary. To treat patterns characterized by yin and blood
deficiency and empty fire, one should select a formula like
Ass-Hide Gelatin and Egg Yolk Decoction (e jido ji zi hudng
tang) or Major Arrest Wind Pearls (da ding feng zha), dis-
cussed in Chapter 14. These formulas retain the yin- and
blood-tonifying ingredients of Coptis and Ass-Hide Gelatin
Decoction (hudng lidn e jido tang} but combine them with
salty and cooling substances that clear heat without damag-
ing the yin.

The particular combination of excess heat and deficiency
of essence treated by this formula is reflected in a strategy
often said to embody the principle of draining the south (i.e.,
fire) while tonifying the north (i.e., water) first outlined in
the Classic of Difficulties. Its distinguishing characteristics
are a capacity for draining damp-heat pathogens from the
body while simultaneously enriching the yin and tonifying
the blood. In the type of cold damage disorders for which
this formula was first composed, such pathogens enter the
body primarily via the mouth and lodge in the Stomach and
Intestines.

Later Usages

The scope of this formula has been expanded by later writ-
ers to include qi-aspect heat penetrating to the blood aspect,
bleeding disorders, and dysenteric disorders due to heat tox-
in. A passage in the 19th-century Japanese work Expansion of
the Categorized Collected Formulas notes:

It treats all kinds of patterns involving loss of blood, chest pal-
pitations, body fever, abdominal pain and mild dysentery, a dry
tongue, burnt lips, irritability and restlessness with inability to
lie down, bodily exhaustion, a complexion drained of blood or,
alternatively, a red, flushed complexion.

In clinical practice, the following pointers provided by the
contemporary physician Huang Huang in One-Hundred
Classic Formulas, based on a review of both Chinese and
Japanese sources, will prove useful in determining when this
formula is appropriate:

* The tongue will be red, indicating the presence of heat.

¢ The pulse will be thin and rapid, indicating the presence of
both heat and yin deficiency.

* The skin will tend to be dry and may show signs of flaking
or chafing, but there will also be redness, particularly in the
face.

* There will often be bleeding or a tendency to bleed, indi-
cating heat stirring the blood to move recklessly.

Comparison

> Vs. Sour JujuBe DEcocTION (sudan zdo ren tang)

Both formulas treat irritability and insomnia. Comparing the
indications of these formulas in their source texts, the dif-

ferences between them become clear. Coptis and Ass-Hide
Gelatin Decoction (hudng lidn e jido tang) is for irritability
when the patient is unable to lie down, that is, when he is so
irritable that he cannot even tolerate lying in bed. This is due
to the yang failing to enter the yin, and the treatment strategy
focuses on draining fire from the Heart and enriching the yin
and blood. Sour Jujube Decoction (sudan zdo ren tang) is for
irritability with insomnia in which the patient is able to lie in
bed, but cannot sleep. This occurs when deficient Liver blood
is unable to nourish the Heart, and the treatment strategy
focuses on tonifying and harmonizing the Liver.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
nervous exhaustion, the recuperative stage of an infectious
disease, autonomic dystonia, erectile dysfunction, apthous
ulcers, and hypertension.

Indications

Disorientation, frequent attacks of melancholy and crying
spells, inability to control oneself, restless sleep (sometimes
with night sweats), and frequent bouts of yawning. In severe
cases, the behavior and speech become abnormal.

This is called restless organ disorder (f#8% zdng zdo), an
emotional condition that is generally due to excessive worry,
anxiety, or pensiveness. This injures the Heart spirit and un-
settles the ethereal and corporeal souls. The pathodynamic
underlying this disorder is outlined in Chapter 11 of Essen-
tials from the Golden Cabinet:

[Patients manifesting with] pathogenic weeping that causes the
ethereal and corporeal souls to be unsettled are deficient in qi
and blood. [Disorders characterized by] qi and blood defi-
ciency pertain to the Heart. Patients with Heart qi deficiency
are [full] of fears. When they close their eyes wanting to sleep,
they dream of going far away, [indicating] that their essence
and spirit are dispersing, and their ethereal and corporeal souls
are moving chaotically.

Patients who have suffered recent or recurring blood loss,
which can further injure the blood and qi, such as women
who have recently given birth, also can suffer from this con-
dition. It is therefore listed in the source text under ‘miscel-
laneous disorders of women.

Not only is the cause of this disorder primarily emotional,
its manifestations are also of an emotional nature. As ex-
plained above, this is due to the ethereal and corporeal souls
losing their mooring and the spirit being lost. The souls are
literally ‘lost; implying that they become detached from the
conventions of normal behavior and are no longer controlled

by the rules and etiquette that govern ordinary human in-
teraction. In the early stages of such a disorder, the patient
is mentally disoriented, anxious, impulsive, and suffers from
fitful sleep. During attacks, they often feel extremely upset or
depressed to the point of uncontrollable crying, manic behav-
ior, or severe disorientation. More severe cases will present
with frequent attacks of unusual behavior, especially those
relating to a loss of self-control (crying, yawning, etc.). One
explanation for the yawning is that it reflects the frustrated
attempt of the yang (which has been almost extruded from
the body due to deficiency of the yin) to reintegrate with
the body. Note that while the source text mentions attacks
of yawning as one of the indications for this formula, many
modern practitioners believe that attacks of moaning or deep
sighing occur more frequently in this type of patient. The in-
somnia and night sweats (sweat, like blood, being associated
with the Heart) reflect that this condition is primarily one of
Heart deficiency.

Analysis of Formula

According to Chapter 8 of Divine Pivot, the ethereal and cor-
poreal souls come and go with the spirit and essence. In order
to guide the drifting souls back toward a more normal attach-
ment to the body, this formula focuses on tonifying the nutri-
tive qi with sweet substances while simultaneously inhibiting
the unrestrained dispersal of the souls. The chief herb, sweet
and salty Tritici Fructus (xido madi), is light in weight, reach-
ing outward to the exterior, yet also enters the Heart channel
where it conserves the fluids of the Heart. According to the
Inner Classic, wheat is the cereal associated with the Heart;
Sun Si-Miao thought that it nourished the Heart qi. This abil-
ity, more commonly used to treat spontaneous sweating and
night sweats, is utilized here to control the dispersal of the
ethereal and corporeal souls. The deputies are sweet Glyc-
yrrhizae Radix (gan cdo), which nourishes the Heart, toni-
fies the qi, and harmonizes the middle burner, and Jujubae
Fructus (da zeo), which augments the gi and moistens in-
ternal dryness. Although both of these herbs are generally
understood to be tonifying, they also clear heat. Records of
Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica, for instance,
observes of Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo) that it “is yellow in
the middle, with a reddish bark,’ and thus

certainly an herb of the Spleen and Heart channels. ... Its ef-
fects are completely due to its sweetness, by which it tonifies,

by which it moderates. Whenever the sage [Zhang] Zhong-Jing
prescribed it in formulas, he used it in its prepared form to
tonify or moderate urgency, but in its unprepared form to drain
fire—yet even this ‘draining’ involved the idea of moderation.

Because the herb is used here in its unprepared form, this
implies that its focus is on draining excess rather than toni-
fying deficiency. Likewise, Divine Husbandman’s Classic of
the Materia Medica states of Jujubae Fructus (da zdo) that


472 Chapter 10 / Formulas that Calm the Spirit

“jt governs pathogenic qi in the Heart and abdomen, quiets
the middle, nourishes the Spleen, and assists the twelve chan-
nels.”

By combining three simple and readily available herbs,
this formula thus achieves a remarkable effect: it guides the
floating souls back within the bounds of normal behavior,
allowing the patient to feel at ease with herself once again. If
the efficacy of such ‘kitchen medicine’ may be difficult to ac-
cept because only powerful remedies are considered capable
of treating unusual disorders, physicians throughout the ages
have been aware that it is precisely this simplicity that gener-
ates the effect. The spirit is yang in nature, but, unlike qi, does
not attach to any substance. It is difficult to influence with
herbs alone and requires the most subtle of treatment strate-
gies. And what could be more subtle then pacifying the way-
ward soul by means of herbs that nourish the nutritive yin,
governed by the Heart and therefore rooting the spirit?

Commentary

While in the source text this formula is discussed under the
heading of ‘miscellaneous women’s disorders, it is equally ap-
plicable to men as well as children.

Which Organ is Restless?

There has been some discussion by later commentators about
the meaning of ‘organ’ in the term restless organ disorder.
Some, like the 18th-century writer You Yi in Personal Stan-
dards for the Essentials from the Golden Cabinet, believed that
it refers to the Womb, and specifically to the deficiency of
blood in that organ. However, this type of problem is also
seen, if less frequently, in men. Others, such as You's contem-
porary, Wu Qian, editor of Golden Mirror of the Medical Tra-
dition, believed that it refers to the Heart. Wu argued that
when the Heart is tranquil, the spirit is properly stored; but
when that organ loses its tranquility, the spirit becomes dis-
orderly. This explanation fits more closely with the purpose
of the formula, which focuses on the Heart. In Elaborating on
the Subtleties of the Golden Cabinet, the modern physician
Cao Ying-Fu argued that the Lungs were the main root of this
disorder because the Lungs are associated with melancholia
and crying, which are prominent symptoms. In fact, all of the
yin organs can be involved, depending on the specific case.
Besides the Heart, the Spleen can be injured by overwork or
obsessive deliberation; fire from Liver constraint is often im-
plicated in hyperactive yang; and qi deficiency also affects
the Kidneys and Lungs. This is the view taken by the Qing-
dynasty author Xu Bin, who writes in Discussion and Annota-
tion of the Essentials from the Golden Cabinet that “[the term]
organ refers to all of the five yin organs.”

Controversy over Pathodynamic

Commentators similarly disagree with respect to the path-

odynamic responsible for producing the symptoms of this
disorder. Some, including the Yuan-dynasty writer Zhao Li-
ang-Ren in Elucidating the Meaning of Discussion of Formu-
las from the Golden Cabinet, argued that the symptoms are
caused by Liver deficiency and subsequent constraint that
also affects the Lung and results in a state where the person is
sad and cries. Although this explanation accords with some
of the actions attributed to Tritici Fructus (xide midi), it is
difficult to reconcile overall with the formula’s emphasis on
controlling floating yang by nourishing the nutritive yin. The
opening and unblocking actions of a formula like Rambling
Powder (xiao ydo sdn) would appear to be much more con-
sistent with the logic of Zhao’s argument.

Other physicians, including You Yi and Pu Fu-Zhou, thus
believed that a pathology of the Womb was not the effect but
rather the cause of this disorder. You’s argument in Personal
Standards for the Essentials from the Golden Cabinet is repre-
sentative of this view:

Restless organ disorder is exactly what Chen [Zi-Ming] was
referring to by blood deficiency of the Womb that is affected

by wind and transforms into fire. In blood deficiency {caus-
ing] restless organ [disorder,] internal fire harasses [the Heart,]
causing the spirit to be uneasy. [This manifests] as sorrow dam-
age with a desire to cry.

Neither of these positions clearly explains why constraint of
the ministerial fire should lead to the symptoms of restless
organ disorder and how this pathology differs from that of a
Sour Jujube Decoction (sudn zdo ren tang) pattern. Wu Qian
and the editors of Golden Mirror of the Medical Tradition
resolve this by simply defining the disorder as a disturbance
of the seven emotions that prevents the Heart from being
tranquil. A similar but slightly more elaborate analysis is of-
fered by Chen Nian-Zu in Simple Annotation of the Essentials
from the Golden Cabinet:

The yin organs pertain to yin. Agitation is due to yin deficiency
that is exploited by fire. There is no need to restrict this to

any particular yin organ because, irrespective of which one is
agitated, the symptoms will be the same. However, the [specific
symptoms] of sorrow damage [accompanied] by a desire to
cry ... are due to a Heart disorder. Observing [that a patient
who] frequently yawns indicates a Kidney disorder. [From this,
one can conclude] that when the five emotions generate fire, its
movement can be linked to the Heart; and that when the yin
organs are damaged, this will invariably exhaust the Kidneys.

This argument, despite explaining some aspects of the condi-
tion, would logically lead to the selection of formulas such
as Emperor of Heaven's Special Pill to Tonify the Heart (tian
wdng bu xin dan) or Coptis and Ass-Hide Gelatin Decoction
(huang lidn e jiao tang), rather than to the present formula.
Another perspective, which can be traced back at least to Ye
Tian-Shi, views this as being due to problems affecting the
Liver and Stomach. As Ye wrote in Selections of Formulas and
Cases from the Hall of Longevity:
