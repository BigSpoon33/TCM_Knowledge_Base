### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows hormone-regulating, bone-strengthening, and longevity-promoting effects. The combination of animal-derived gelatin with plant-based yin tonics provides comprehensive nutritional support. Studies demonstrate efficacy in infertility, osteoporosis, and age-related decline.

### Clinical Experience
Ultimate formula for aging-related yin deficiency and reproductive disorders. Particularly effective for women with fertility issues and menopausal symptoms. Often used long-term for constitutional support and healthy aging. Best results with adequate rest and nutrition.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: 6-9g granules twice daily, or traditional pills as directed
**Preparation**: Usually taken as pills, can be decocted
**Timing**: Between meals with warm water
**Duration**: 3-6 months minimum for chronic conditions, longer for anti-aging
