Formulas that Sedate and Calm the Spirit 481

ter, and warming Aquilariae Lignum resinatum (chen xiang)
comprise a second group of assistants that regulate the qi
dynamic. Bubali Cornu (shui niu jido) clears heat from the
nutritive gi and settles fright, while Aquilariae Lignum res-
inatum (chen xiang) directs the qi from the upper into the
lower burner, facilitating the transformation of hyperactive
yang into physiological qi. The small amount of Cinnabaris
(zhi sha), which is used to coat the pills, serves as an envoy
that focuses the action of the entire formula on the spirit.

Note that, due to its endangered status, Rhinocerotis Cor-
nu (xi jido) is not used at present; Bubali Cornu (shui niti
jido) is substituted, with a much larger dosage. Also, the en-
dangered status of Aquilariae Lignum resinatum (chen xiang)
can make it difficult to obtain, as a certificate of cultivation is
needed for importation.

Overall, therefore, this formula is very balanced. Accord-
ing to Ran Xue-Feng in Annotated Fine Formulas from Gen-
erations of Famous Physicians, “it uses moistening in order
to tonify, and tonification in order to unblock, Nurturing the
generating dynamic for the good offices of the normal qi, this
is the mildest formula among those that sedate and calm the
spirit.”

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula contains a number of cloying ingredients and is
therefore contraindicated in the treatment of insomnia, fright
palpitations, and similar conditions in those with patterns of
phlegm-dampness or phlegm-heat.

Commentary

This formula was composed by the Song-dynasty physician
Xu Shou-Wei. It is listed in the source text as treating wind-
stroke with the following pattern:

When a wind pathogen is received in the interior due to
[preexisting] deficiency of the Liver channel, the ethereal soul
disperses [and cannot be] conserved. The presentation is one of
fright palpitations.

In Chinese medicine, fright palpitations are defined as those
caused by sudden shock and fright, such as witnessing or
hearing something horrible or frightening, especially when it
is completely unexpected. Ordinary palpitations may also be
accompanied by anxiety, but there the causation is reversed,
that is, palpitations reflect a state of nervousness in which one
becomes more easily frightened, rather than fright causing
the palpitations.

Most commentators have followed Xu Shou-Wei’s in-
terpretation and define Liver deficiency producing internal

wind as the pathodynamic underlying this pattern. Based on
their own clinical experience, later physicians added other
symptoms to this pattern. One-Hundred Questions on Wom-
en’s Disorders, for instance, prescribes its for the treatment
of “red-colored urine [with urination] that is neither rough
nor painful, suggesting the presence of internal heat. This
is likely, as the Liver carries the ministerial fire, which by
its nature is hot. In contemporary texts such as Annotated
Fine Formulas from Generations of Famous Physicians by Ran
Xue-Feng, this is further linked to nervous system disorders.
In Six Texts Summarizing the Medicine of Xu Ling-Tai, the
Qing-dynasty scholar-physician Xu Da-Chun attributes this
pathodynamic to:

Liver deficiency with blazing heat [in which] the overwhelming
heat engenders wind. [The wind] prevents the Heart qi from
directing downward [and the Liver] from storing the ethereal
soul. Restless sleeping and dreaming ensue, generating [a pat-
tern characterized by] fright palpitations and insomnia.

Comparison

> Vs. CINNABAR PILL TO CALM THE SPIRIT (zhii sha an
shen wdn)

Both of these formulas treat disordered spirit associated with
fire excess and blood deficiency leading to such symptoms as
agitation, irritability, restlessness, palpitations, insomnia, and
dream-disturbed sleep. However, Cinnabar Pill to Calm the
Spirit (zhi sha an shen wan) focuses on the Heart, whereas
Mother-of-Pearl Pill (zhen zhi mut wan) focuses on the Liver,
This is reflected in symptoms such as dizziness and a thin,
wiry pulse. The pulse in patterns for which Cinnabar Pill to
Calm the Spirit (zhit sha dn shen wan) is indicated will, in-
stead, tend to be thin and rapid.

Biomedical Indications
With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used

to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
epilepsy and cataracts.

Alternate names

Infants; Mother-of-Pearl Special Pill (zhen zhi dan) in Additions to the
Essential Teachings of [Zhu] Dan-Xi

Modification

* For a more severe presentation, add Magnetitum (ci shi),
Ostreae Concha (mu li), or Fossilia Ossis Mastodi (long gu).
