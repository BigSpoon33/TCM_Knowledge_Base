§32 Chapter 12 / Formulas that Regulate the Qi

In this manner, the root of the disorder is treated by
warming and tonifying the Liver and Kidneys, and the branch
by promoting the movement of qi and dispersing the cold.

Cautions and Contraindications

Contraindicated in patients with heat, redness, swelling, and
pain of the scrotum due to damp-heat pouring down into the
lower burner.

Commentary

The analysis of this formula and its indications given above
are derived from contemporary Chinese medical textbooks
that tend to attribute this type of bulging disorder to cold
obstructing the Liver channel. However, the author of the
source text, Zhang Jie-Bin, presents a different approach.
Zhang states that this formula was composed to treat “sudden
or severe pain from bulging disorder ... [in a pattern] that is
not characterized by the presence of excess pathogenic [qi]
yet is of a cold nature.” Like other physicians, he observed
many different types of bulging disorder, but he was clear
that:

Cold-type bulging disorder can cause the most severe pain. It
is most often caused by contracting cold pathogenic qi or by
habitually [eating] raw foods. It generally occurs in those [pa-
tients] who like warmth and are averse to cold, [whose] pulse
is wiry and thin, [whose] hands, feet, and tip of the nose are
generally cold [to the touch], and [who] do not have any heat
signs in their stool or urine.

For Zhang Jie-Bin, deficiency thus constituted an important
background factor in the etiology and presentation of the
patterns that define this formula’s scope of action:

[This pattern occurs] because of excessive sexual desires, or
because of harm from overwork, or from pent-up anger, or
following the consumption of damp foods and alcoholic drinks.
Having no idea about what to be wary of, when they contract a
cold pathogen, the yin [from the outside] seeks out the yin [in
the inside] and flows into and clumps in the Conception and
Penetrating vessels, the seas of gi and blood. Flowing down-
ward into the yin parts, it then generates all types of bulging
disorders.

In his understanding of the pathodynamic of bulging disor-
ders, Zhang Jie-Bin follows the original definition of bulg-
ing qi advanced in Chapter 60 of Basic Questions: “When the
Conception vessel causes illness, in men there is clumping in-
ternally and there are the seven [types of] bulging disorders.
In women, there are discharges as well as conglomerations
and gatherings (74% jid ji)” This was reiterated in Chap-
ter 20 of Classic of Difficulties: “When the Conception vessel
gives rise to illness, one suffers from internal clumps ( #4 nei
jie). In men, this gives rise to the seven [types of] bulging
disorders; in women, to concretions and accumulations.” The
Qing-dynasty writer Chen Jin-Ao elaborates on this patho-
dynamic in Wondrous Lantern for Peering into the Origin and

Development of Miscellaneous Diseases: “If the Conception
vessel gives rise to illness, this is not illness that comes from
the yin, but in reality [it refers to problems] that arise because
there is no yang in the yin.” If yin here is understood to refer
to the blood, and yang to the qi, in particular the yang qi or
ministerial fire generated in the gate of vitality, then disorders
of the Conception vessel refer to illness caused by failure of
the yang qi to mobilize and move the yin blood. Naturally,
this occurs more readily when these resources are depleted
by inappropriate habits and lifestyles, and when a persor’s
essence-blood has become depleted.

This perspective, the particular choice of herbs in this
formula, makes eminent sense. Many of the herbs in this for-
mula, for instance, are regularly used by gynecologists and
other physicians who wish to address disorders of the ex-
traordinary vessels. Foeniculi Fructus (xido hui xidng) is said
to enter the Conception vessel, tonify the gate of vitality, and
warm the cinnabar field (4+ ® dan tidn). Cinnamomi Cortex
(rou gui), likewise, tonifies the ministerial fire at the gate of
vitality, and warms the Conception vessel. Aquilariae Lignum
resinatum (chen xiang) enters the gate of vitality. Angelicae
sinensis Radix (dang gui) and Lycii Fructus (geu qi zi) are im-
portant herbs for tonifying the blood and essence of the Con-
ception and Penetrating vessels. Even Poria (fii ling) is used
by some physicians to direct herbs into the Stomach channel,
and so, at least indirectly, into the Penetrating vessel.

Because the Liver stores the blood, is associated with
the sea of blood, and is closely connected physiologically to
the functions of the Conception vessel, naming the formula
Warm the Liver Decoction (nudn gan jian) is not inconsistent
with this interpretation. In fact, as shown in the discussion of
Resolve the Liver Decoction (jie gan jidn) below, Zhang Jie-
Bin often named his formulas after the branch of the treat-
ment, rather than the root. This understanding extends the
formula’s applications to the treatment of dysmenorrhea due
to cold and deficiency of the Conception and Penetrating
vessels, and makes it a base formula for the treatment of Liver
yang deficiency patterns in contemporary practice.

Comparison
> Vs. Top-QUALITY LINDERA PowDER (fidn tdi wit yao sdn)

Both formulas treat bulging disorders characterized by acute
abdominal pain that may radiate into the testes. This is caused
by qi stagnation and clumping of gi and fluids following the
invasion of cold pathogenic qi. However, Top-Quality Lindera
Powder (tidn tdi wit ydo sdn) treats patterns of excess in pa-
tients with strong constitutions. Warm the Liver Decoction
(nudn gan jidn), on the other hand, treats mixed patterns
of excess and deficiency, where a cold pathogen causes qi
stagnation in a patient whose essence, blood, and yang are
deficient. For this reason, Top-Quality Lindera Powder (tian
tdi wii yao sdn) focuses entirely on dispersing stagnation by


Formulas that Promote the Movement of Qi 533

means of acrid, warming herbs, whereas Warm the Liver De-
coction (nudn gan jidn) also tonifies the fire at the gate of
vitality and nourishes the sea of blood.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
varicocele, hydrocele, and inguinal hernia.

constraint and qi stagnation characterized by fullness, distention,
and pain in the chest and flanks, diarrhea, or restless fetus. Although
this formula resolves Liver qi constraint, its focus is on regulating the
qi dynamic of the middle burner. In terms of five-phase doctrine, it
thus treats a pattern where earth excess constrains the transforma-
tions of wood qi via the control cycle. This is explained in a com-
mentary by the modern physician Qin Bo-Wei in [Qin] Qian-Zhai’s
Lecture Notes on Medicine:

Although this formula is called Resolve the Liver [Decoction],
apart from Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi shdo), [which] nourishes
the Liver, and Perillae Folium (zi sa ye), which aromatically
dredges its qi, it only contains substances that transform damp-
ness, move the qi, and regulate the Spleen and Stomach. Be-
cause [in this pattern] Spleen and Stomach dampness obstruct
the qi [causing it] to stagnate, which impacts the spreading of
Liver gi, in order to treat the root, one must focus on the middle
burner. Therefore, the formula does not employ Bupleuri Radix

(chdi hit) to dredge the Liver but Perillae Folium (zi si ye), rely-
ing on its ability to smoothe Liver constraint while also being
able to harmonize the Spleen and Stomach. If the Spleen and
Stomach are [sufficiently] strong to transport [qi and blood, ]
then the Liver qi expands naturally. Therefore, resolving the
Liver implies resolving what constrains the Liver and not treat-
ing the Liver directly.

Method of Preparation Decoction. The source text does
not specify which type of Glehniae/Adenophorae Radix (sha
shen) should be used. Practitioners, therefore, must use their
own discretion in prescribing Glehniae Radix (bei sha shen) or
& Adenophorae Radix (nda sha shen). Both herbs moisten dry-
ness, but the former is better suited for enriching the yin, while
the latter is better for transforming phlegm. The use of Oryzae
Testa (++ 30 HR chit teu kang) is first mentioned in Comprehensive
Outline of the Materia Medica, where it is described as sweet,
acrid, and warming, and as entering the Stomach and Large
Intestine to open the Stomach and direct the qi downward.
Nelumbinis Calyx (47 & # he ye di) is described as being bit-
ter and astringent, with a balanced nature. It enters the Spleen,
Stomach, and Liver to strengthen the Spleen, expel dampness,
direct the Spleen qi upward, and stimulate its yang functions.
If these herbs are unavailable, practitioners should make
appropriate substitutions. One suggestion is to substitute
Nelumbinis Folium (he ye) for Nelumbinis Calyx (he ye di).
For Oryzae Testa (chi teu kang), possible substitutions include
Inulae Flos (xudn fir hud) together with Setariae (Oryzae)
Fructus germinatus (gu yd), or Evodiae Fructus (wu zhi yu)
together with Citri sarcodactylis Fructus (f0 shou).

® Actions Regulates the qi, opens constraint, moistens dryness,
® and transforms phlegm

Indications

Swallowing that is accompanied by a choking sensation,
or the feeling of esophageal constriction or blockage, focal
distention of the chest and diaphragm, or distention that is
accompanied by indistinct pain and relieved by belching,
dry retching, or spitting up of phlegm or oral mucus. These
primary symptoms may be accompanied by difficult bowel
movements, a dry mouth and throat, gradual emaciation, a
red tongue with a white coating, and a thin, wiry pulse.


534 Chapter 12 / Formulas that Regulate the Qi

This is dysphagia-occlusion (*& "4 ye ge). Chronic qi con-
straint leads to clumping of qi such that the body fluids are no
longer dispersed throughout the body but collect and trans-
form into phlegm. This robs the gi dynamic of its lubrication
but also obstructs the vessels and collaterals. This is experi-
enced as dryness of the mouth and throat, occlusion of the
esophagus, and indistinct pain. Stagnation of the qi dynamic
manifests as focal distention in the chest and diaphragm. As
the Stomach’s downward-directing function becomes imped-
ed, vomiting, spitting up of phlegm and oral mucus, and dry
retching result. Desiccation of the yang fluids eventually af-
fects the blood, causing the stools to become dry and difficult,
the mucous membranes to dry up, and the body to take on
an emaciated appearance. The red tongue indicates damage
to the body fluids, the white coating the presence of phlegm.
The thin pulse, likewise, reflects deficiency of yin fluids, while
its wiry quality points to phlegm and qi stagnation.

Analysis of Formula

This formula treats stagnation of the qi dynamic causing the
body fluids to congeal as phlegm, which deprives the organ-
ism of physiological fluids and leads to dryness. While qi
stagnation is generally treated by means of acrid, warming
herbs, such a strategy is clearly contraindicated in this case.
Instead, the formula adopts a strategy of moistening dryness
to resolve constraint, while simultaneously transforming the
phlegm and opening up the clumping. This is reflected in
the synergism between the two chief herbs, Glehniae/Ade-
nophorae Radix (sha shen) and Fritillariae cirrhosae Bulbus
(chuan bei mt). The former clears Stomach heat and enrich-
es without being cloying. The latter resolves constraint and
transforms phlegm without being drying. Together, these two
herbs effectively open the gi dynamic of the upper burner
when it has become clogged by phlegm.

Curcumae Radix (yi jin), which facilitates the movement
of qi to open up constraint while also dispelling blood stasis
to disperse clumping, and Amomi Fructus (sha ren), which
moves the qi to promote the qi dynamic of the middle burner
and harmonizes the Stomach to stop vomiting and retching,
serve as deputies. The remaining herbs are all assistants. Poria
(fu ling) leaches out dampness and transforms phlegm and
gently supports the middle burner in its production of blood
without being drying. Salviae miltiorrhizae Radix (dan shen)
invigorates the blood, eliminates stasis, and thereby assists
the dispersion of clumping that has penetrated to the blood
aspect. Nelumbinis Calyx (he ye di) directs the yang upward
and strengthens the Spleen’s transportive and transforma-
tive functions to dispel dampness and harmonize the Stom-
ach. Oryzae Testa (cht teu kang) opens the Stomach, directs
the qi downward, and is a specific herb for the treatment
of occlusion. Together, the assistants effectively facilitate the
downward-directing of turbid phlegm and support the ascent
of the clear yang to unblock the qi dynamic and eliminate

pathogenic excess without causing further dryness. Although
the formula does not contain any specific envoys, this func-
tion is covered by the complementary synergism developed
between the two herbs Nelumbinis Calyx (he ye di) and Ory-
zae Testa (chi teu kang), which focus on the ascending and
descending functions of the qi dynamic , with the diaphragm
as its fulcrum.

Cautions and Contraindications

Although this formula moistens dryness, its focus is on regu-
lating the qi dynamic and transforming phlegm. It is contra-
indicated in cases of occlusion due to blood stasis character-
ized by an inability to swallow food or vomiting up of blood;
in yin deficiency patterns with desiccated fluids characterized
by a tongue without coating; and in qi and yang deficiency
patterns accompanied by weight loss and fading spirits.

Commentary

The Chinese medical disease category dysphagia-occlusion
describes a range of conditions characterized by sensations of
obstruction and occlusion of the esophagus that are accom-
panied by vomiting or retching. The Qing-dynasty physician
Cheng Guo-Peng composed this formula in response to what
he perceived as being shortcomings in traditional strategies
for treating dysphagia-occlusion. Cheng wrote:

Ancient formulas for treating dysphagia-occlusion generally
rely on medicinals that stop vomiting. They disregard [the
fact] that vomiting is a symptom of dampness, for which dry-
ing is the suitable [treatment strategy]. Dysphagia-occlusion

is a symptom of dryness that is best [treated] by moistening.
... The symptoms of dysphagia-occlusion do not go beyond
the four words ‘dry withering [of the] gastric cavity’ (7 hi-F
4% wei wdn gan gdo). If withering [occurs] in the upper [part
of the] gastric cavity, fluids [still] pass but food enters only
with difficulty. If withering [occurs] in the lower [part of the]
gastric cavity, food enters but is vomited [up again] after some
time. If the Stomach is withered and one administers drying
herbs, will this not aggravate the dryness rather than effect

a cure? This is why Major and Minor Pinellia Deoctions (da
xido ban xia tang) are contraindicated in [the treatment of]
dysphagia-occlusion. Instead, one should use Open Diaphrag-
matic Occlusion Powder (qi ge sdn) to open the gate and assist
it [by following up] with Four-Gentlemen Decoction (si jin zi
tang) to regulate the Spleen and Stomach.

One of the other formulas suggested by Cheng Guo-Peng in
the treatment of dysphagia-occlusion was Rambling Powder
(xiao ydo sen). This underscores the importance he accorded
to the regulation of the qi dynamic and the middle burner in
the treatment of this disorder.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
esophagitis, esophageal diverticulum, and the early stages of
esophageal cancer.

So
# regulates the menses, and alleviates pain

Indications

For dysmenorrhea with scanty, dark menstrual blood with
clots, Pain occurs before the onset of menstruation or during
the early part of menstruation. Lower abdominal pain will be
accompanied by distention, which is more pronounced than
the pain. There may also be premenstrual symptoms such
as swollen and painful breasts. The tongue is normal with a
white coating, and the pulse is wiry and tight.

This is dysmenorrhea due to qi stagnation, which causes
blood stasis. Menstruation depends not only on the accu-
mulation of blood in the Womb, but also on the downward
movement of qi that guides the blood downward and out of
the body. Qi stagnation in the lower abdomen is experienced
as pain and distention. The fact that distention is more severe
than pain indicates that qi stagnation rather than blood stasis
is the root cause of this pattern. This is also the reason why
the symptoms occur premenstrually or during the early part

of menstruation. However, because the flow of blood is also
impeded, menstruation may be scanty, with dark menstrual
blood. The uterus and sea of blood in the lower abdomen
connect with the Liver and Stomach channels through the
Conception and Penetrating vessels. Failure of the gi to move
the blood in the uterus below may thus lead to qi excess
above manifesting in distended, swollen, and painful breasts,
as these are traversed by the Liver and Stomach channels.
The tongue is normal, indicating that the disorder is in the
qi rather than the blood. The white coating suggests cold as a
possible cause of the stagnation. The wiry and tight qualities
of the pulse reflect the same pathodynamic,

Analysis of Formula

This formula employs acrid and warming herbs that facil-
itate the movement of qi in order to promote the smooth
flow of menstrual blood. Acrid, warming Linderae Radix (wi
yao), which gives the formula its name, is the chief herb. It
smoothes the flow of qi, disperses cold, and alleviates pain.
It directs rebellious gi downward to help relieve the excess
symptoms in the chest, disperses cold to address the cause of
the stagnation, and alleviates pain to treat the symptoms. Ac-
rid, aromatic, and neutral Cyperi Rhizoma (xiang fit) serves
as the deputy, complementing the functions of the chief herb
in multiple ways. It specifically treats disorders due to qi
clumping, but also enters the blood aspect to move blood
that has become static due to qi stagnation. If Linderae Ra-
dix (wit yao) is better at directing the qi downward, Cyperi
Rhizoma (xidng fi) is better at raising and lifting the qi. If
the former is better at eliminating cold, the latter is better at
resolving constraint due to emotional factors. Their combi-
nation thus addresses the blockage of qi within both the qi
and blood levels, releases constraint from both the Liver and
Gallbladder, directs rebellious qi in the chest and abdomen
downward, and warms the flow of qi, which has been slowed
by pathogenic cold.

With the exception of Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo), all of
the other herbs serve as assistants. Amomi Fructus (sha ren)
and Aucklandiae Radix (mu xiang) focus on the qi dynamic
of the middle burner, the Spleen and the Stomach, because of
its focal role in the ascent and descent of qi. Bitter and acrid
Aucklandiae Radix (mii xiang) promotes the movement of qi
and stops pain. Acrid, warming, and aromatic Amomi Fructus
(sha ren) also promotes the movement of qi and transforms
dampness. Together with Aucklandiae Radix (mu xiang), it re-
duces distention and alleviates pain while also strengthening
the Spleen. Because qi moves not just the blood but also the
fluids, qi stagnation is widely accompanied by dampness and
water accumulation. This conjunction of symptoms, often
found in premenstrual syndrome, is effectively addressed by
this combination of herbs. Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng
jidng) warms the Stomach to disperse cold, supporting the
warming, dispersing action of the chief herbs and the regula-
