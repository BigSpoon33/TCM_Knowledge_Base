Formulas that Treat Malarial Disorders and Vent Pathogens from the Membrane Source 135

dampness and phlegm are obvious etiological factors. This
formula influenced the approach to all subsequent treatment
of malarial disorders, and the herbal combinations used here
were taken up by later physicians in the treatment of other
epidemic infectious diseases. The most influential of these
was the Ming-dynasty physician Wu You-Ke, whose Reach
the Source Drink (dd yudn yin) is discussed below.

Biomedical indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat malaria and similar biomedically-defined disorders.

Modifications

* For malarial attacks that occur with increasing frequency
or do not respond to treatment, indicating that the patho-
gen has moved from the qi to the blood level, add herbs
that invigorate the blood and expel stasis like Trogopterori
Faeces (wii ling zhi) and Persicae Semen (tdo ren).

* For strong chills, add Cinnamomi Ramulus (gu? zhi).

¢ For nausea and vomiting, add Pinelliae Rhizoma prepara-
tum (zhi ban xia) and Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng
jiang).

Source Formulary of the Pharmacy Service for Benefiting the People
in the Taiping Era (1107)

Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mii) ....... ... .. .. ., L000g
Dichroae Radix (chdngshdn).. ©... 00. 2.2 00... .. 1000g
Tsaoko Fructus (cdo gud)... 0... eee 1000g

Alpiniae officinarum Rhizoma (gdo lidngjiang)......... .... 600g

The source texts advises to grind the herbs into powder and prepare
a draft by decocting 9g in 1 cup of water with 5 slices of Zingiberis
Rhizoma recens (sheng jiang) and 1 piece of Jujubae Fructus (da zdo)
until one-third has evaporated. Checks malaria and treats phlegm
by warming the yang and draining heat. Like the principal formula,
Dichroa Drink (chdng shan yin) checks malaria by combining Di-
chroae Radix (chdng shan) and Tsaoko Fructus (cdo gud). However,
it focuses on harmonizing the yin and yang rather than moving qi
stagnation and expelling phlegm. It utilizes Anemarrhenae Rhizoma

(zhi mi) to drain heat from the yang brightness and Mume Fruc-
tus (wi mei) to generate fluids, while Alpiniae officinarum Rhizoma
(gao lidng jiang) and Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata (zh) gdn cdo)
warm the greater yin and tonify the qi. The Qing-dynasty physician
Fei Bo-Xiong recommended this formula for malaria that did not
respond to other treatments.
