## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
"Jia Wei" means "added flavors" - referring to the addition of Chai Hu and Shan Zhi to Gui Pi Tang. This modification addresses the common clinical scenario where heart-spleen deficiency occurs with liver qi stagnation. The liver component is essential for people with stress-related insomnia and mood issues.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows enhanced benefits compared to Gui Pi Tang for mood disorders. Chai Hu provides liver-protective and stress-reducing effects while Shan Zhi clears heat and reduces inflammation. The combination demonstrates superior results for anxiety-depression and stress-related conditions compared to the original formula.

### Clinical Experience
Superior to Gui Pi Tang for people with both fatigue and emotional volatility. Particularly effective for women with premenstrual symptoms, postpartum depression, or menopausal mood changes. Often preferred in modern practice due to the high prevalence of liver qi stagnation in stressed populations.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, can reduce Chai Hu if too dispersing
**Timing**: Morning and evening doses, evening dose 2 hours before bed
**Duration**: 1-3 months for chronic conditions, often used for maintenance
