= ame oil for one week. Heat the herbs and oil gently until it begins

| to slowly bubble. Lower the heat and cook until the Angelicae
= sinensis Radix (dang gui) begins to slightly brown on the edges.
Turn off the heat, and when the mixture cools to the point that

it will not burn the skin, strain out the herbs. Reheat the liquid
over a low flame. When it is warm enough to melt the bees-
wax, add it in. Stir the mixture until the beeswax is completely
melted, and then spoon the mixture into glass containers to cool
and harden into an ointment, The amount of beeswax needed
depends on the type of beeswax used, the season of the year, and
the consistency desired for the ointment. To achieve the proper
consistency of ointment, more beeswax is needed in the summer
and less in the winter.

When cooling the oil after it is boiled with the herbs, it is

traditional in China to place the pot with the hot oil inside a
pot with cool water, in a setup resembling a double boiler. This

the high heat has imparted to the oil.

Note: The source text does not specify the quantity of sesame
oil or beeswax. The suggested quantities are estimates based on
