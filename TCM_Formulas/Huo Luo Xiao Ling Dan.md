Formulas that Pacify and Extinguish internal Wind 653

Comparisons

> Vs. ANTELOPE HoRN AND UNCARIA DECOCTION
(ling jido gou teng tang)

Both formulas treat patterns of warm pathogen disorders
where heat has penetrated to the blood aspect causing stir-
ring of internal wind. However, Antelope Horn and Uncaria
Decoction (ling jido gou teng tang) treats excess patterns with
heat in the blood generating wind, characterized by high fe-
ver, irritability, restlessness, dizziness, vertigo, twitching and
spasms of the extremities, a deep-red, dry, or burnt tongue
with prickles, and a wiry, rapid pulse. By contrast, Major Ar-
rest Wind Pearls (da ding feng zhii) treats late-stage deficiency
patterns with harm to the true yin, and yang separating from
yin, characterized by weariness, muscle spasms with alternat-
ing flexion and extension of the extremities, a deficient or
frail pulse, and a deep-red tongue with a scanty or peeled
coating.

The source text advises to first decoct Testudinis Plastrum (gui ban)
with Mylilussiccus (dan cai) in 5 cups of water until 2 cups remain
before dissolving Asini Corii Colla (e jiao) in the strained decoc-
tion. When this has cooled down, egg yolk (ji zi hudng) and Infantis
Urina (teng bian) are added. Enriches the yin, extinguishes the
wind, and stops the vomiting. For warm pathogens that have been
in the body for a long time and entered the lower burner, causing
inversion characterized by vomiting and a thin but still forceful
pulse. Wu Ju-Tong, the author of this formula, defines this as a
disorder of the Penetrating vessel combining aspects of both excess
and deficiency, which are reflected in the pulse. According to the
source text, the formula uses the combination of Asini Corii Colla
(e jio) and egg yolk (ji zi hudng) to nourish the yin and extinguish
the wind; Testudinis Plastrum (gui bdn) “to tonify the Conception
vessel and settle the Penetrating vessel”; Mytilus seu Perma (dan
cai) to tonify the Liver and Kidneys, and because of its “ability to
tonify the true yang within the yin ... as well as anchor the upward
movement of the true yang”; and Infantis Urina (teng bidn) “as
a turbid fluid that guides [the formula] into the turbid pathways
[of the Penetrating vessel].’ Compared to the principal formula,
it is less tonifying and is indicated for patterns where the yin and
essence have not yet been completely exhausted.

Indications

Rigid extremities, muscle spasms and twitches in the extremi-
ties, dry mouth, parched lips, a deep-red tongue with a scanty
coating, and a thin, rapid pulse. There may also be dizziness
and vertigo.

This is blood deficiency and insufficiency of yin fluids
that leads to stirring of internal wind. It is a pattern that oc-
curs in the late stages of warm pathogen disorders and is re-
ferred to as ‘deficiency wind’ (i A xii feng). Because the yin
and blood have been damaged by the warm pathogen, they
are unable to nourish the sinews, leading to yang excess char-
acterized by twitches, spasms, and rigidity in the muscles of
the extremities. Muscle twitches, which appear and disappear
quickly and involve rapid movements, are associated with
wind. The mechanism leading to dizziness and vertigo may
be explained in terms of the five phases: when water, which
has been damaged by heat, is unable to generate wood, the re-
sult is Liver yin and blood deficiency, which leads to internal
stirring of wind. The dry mouth and parched lips are indica-
tive of heat injuring the yin and fluids. The deep-red tongue
with a scanty coating and the thin, rapid pulse are signs of
heat injuring the yin.

Analysis of Formula

The focus of this formula is primarily to nourish the yin and
blood, and secondarily to sedate the yang and unblock the
channels. The chief ingredients, Asini Corii Colla (e jiao) and
egg yolk (ji zi hudng), nourish the yin and blood, extinguish
wind, and sedate the yang. He Lian-Chen says of this combi-
nation: “These two ingredients [belong to medicinals made
from the] blood and flesh of sentient beings. They are heavy
substances with a thick flavor. They are very capable of pro-
viding yin, extinguishing wind, augmenting the yin fluids,
and moistening the sinews.” The deputies, Rehmanniae Radix
(sheng di hudng), fresh Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi shdo), and
Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata (zhi gdn cdo), a combination
of sweet and sour substances, soften the Liver to extinguish
the wind, The combination of Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi shdo)
and Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata (zhi gan cdo) is very effec-
tive in treating painful spasms.

The assistants, Uncariae Ramulus cum Uncis (g6u teng),
Haliotidis Concha (shf jue ming), and Ostreae Concha (mi
h), sedate the ascendant yang and extinguish wind. These ac-
tions are indirectly strengthened by Poriae Sclerotium para-
radicis (fu shen), which calms the Liver and the spirit. The en-
voy, Trachelospermi Caulis (luo shi teng), focuses the actions
of the other ingredients on the collaterals and sinews. Divine
Husbandman’s Materia Medica prescribes this formula for
wind-heat with lifeless muscles; Miscellaneous Records of Fa-
mous Physicians states that it nourishes the Kidneys, governs
lumbar and sacral pain, fortifies the sinews, and facilitates

movement in the joints. Especially when combined with Pae-
oniae Radix alba (bdi shdo) and Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata
(zhi gan cdo), it is very effective in relaxing the sinews and
unblocking the collaterals.

Working synergistically, the ingredients of this formula
tonify deficiency (injury to the yin fluids and blood) while
also effectively dealing with the excess (internal stirring of
wind). In practice, it is essential to distinguish the primary
from the secondary aspects of the disorder. The relative dos-
age of the ingredients should reflect this distinction.

Commentary

The source text does not specify an indication for this formu-
la but merely notes that it represents “a strategy for enriching
the yin and extinguishing wind.“ In Revised Popular Guide
to the Discussion of Cold Damage, He Lian-Chen defines its
pathodynamic more precisely:

[This is] not true [i.e., external] wind but blood deficiency gen-
erating wind. Its real cause is the failure of blood to nourish the
sinews [so that] the vessels constrict and the sinews contract,
making flexion and extension impossible. Thus, the hands and
feet contract. This is similar to stirring of wind [in internal
medicine]. Therefore, it is called surreptitious wind due to
internal deficiency (WS sii 8 A, ne} xii an feng) and is generally
known as Liver wind. This pattern often occurs when a warm
pathogen heat disorder remains in the collaterals. In [those
cases, it is due to heat damaging the blood and yin fluids.

This explanation clarifies that use of the formula is not re-
stricted to warm pathogen heat disorders, but that it is equal-
ly useful for treating internal medicine patterns character-
ized by yin and blood deficiency and hyperactive Liver yang
with such symptoms as dizziness and tinnitus. Key markers
in both cases will be a dry mouth and dry lips, a crimson
tongue with little coating, and a thin, rapid pulse.

Historically, the treatment strategies on which this formu-
la is based were first elucidated by the Qing-dynasty physician
Ye Tian-Shi in Case Records as a Guide to Clinical Practice. To
treat patterns characterized by internal wind seizing the col-
laterals and deficiency wind, Ye recommended strategies like
“relaxing the Liver, moistening the blood, and extinguishing
wind,’ and “nourishing the blood to extinguish wind.” He also
argued that “wind herbs [as well as] cold and cooling [for-
mulas] are strongly contraindicated,” as are “hard and drying
herbs.” Some writers, like the contemporary formula expert
Chen Chao-Zu in Treatment Strategies and Formulas in Chi-
nese Medicine, argue that the use of Trachelospermi Caulis
(lud shf teng) in this formula violates these principles and its
use should accordingly be reconsidered.

Formulas that Pacify and Extinguish Internal Wind 655

Both formulas were composed by Yu Gen-Chu to treat stir-
ring of Liver wind in the context of warm pathogen disorders
and both contain Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi shdo}, Uncariae
Ramulus cum Uncis (g6u teng), Poriae Sclerotium pararadicis
(fu shen), Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di hudng), and Glycyr-
thizae Radix (gan cdo) to relax the Liver, enrich the fluids,
clear fire, and extinguish wind. Antelope Horn and Uncaria
Decoction (ling jido gou teng tang) combines these ingredi-
ents with Saigae tataricae Cornu (ling ydng jido), Mori Folium
(sang ye), Chrysanthemi Flos (ju hud), Fritillariae cirrhosae
Bulbus (chudn bei mt), and Bambusae Caulis in taeniam (zhti
ru), while also specifying that Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di
hudng) and Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo) should be used
fresh. As a result, it is stronger at clearing fire while also trans-
forming phlegm, and is indicated for spasms and convulsions
as well as loss of consciousness that occurs during episodes
of high fever.

By contrast, Ass-Hide Gelatin and Egg Yoke Decoction
(e jido ji zi hudng tang) adds egg yolk (ji zi hudng), Asini Co-
rii Colla (e jiao), Ostreae Concha (mii li), Haliotidis Concha
(shi jue ming), and Trachelospermi Caulis (luo shf teng), as
well as Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata (zhi gan cdo). It thus
focuses more strongly on nourishing the blood and provid-
ing essence, on anchoring the errant yang, and on opening
the collaterals and sinew vessels. It is indicated for late-stage
warm pathogen and yin deficiency disorders characterized by

muscle spasms, dizziness, a thin and rapid pulse, and other
signs of empty wind.

> Vs. Major ARREST WIND Pzar.s (de ding feng zhii)

Both formulas treat internal wind caused by essence and
blood deficiency and contain Egg yolk (ji zi hudng), Asini
Corii Colla (e jido), Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi shdo), Rehman-
niae Radix (sheng di hudng), and Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan
cao) to provide yin, anchor the errant yang, and extinguish
wind. However, Major Arrest Wind Pearls (da ding feng zhii)
is indicated for conditions of severe deficiency with yin and
yang beginning to separate. For this reason, it does not treat
wind directly, but relies entirely on enriching the yin and con-
taining the yang with substances like Testudinis Plastrum (gui
ben), Trionycis Carapax (bie jid), Ophiopogonis Radix (mai
men dong), Cannabis Semen (hud md ren), and Schisandrae
Fructus (wi wei zi). Ass-Hide Gelatin and Egg Yolk Decoc-
tion (e jido ji zi hudng tang), on the other hand, directly elimi-
nates wind from the vessel sinews and collaterals with herbs
like Uncariae Ramulus cum Uncis (geu teng) and Trachelo-
spermi Caulis (Iud shi teng), even if its main focus is also on
nourishing the blood.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
the sequelae of encephalitis and meningitis.
