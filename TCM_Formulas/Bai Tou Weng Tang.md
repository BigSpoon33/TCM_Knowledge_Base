112 Chapter 3 / Formulas that Harmonize

pium (chen pt), assist Bambusae Caulis in taeniam (zhti ri) in
draining Gallbladder and Stomach heat, directing rebellious
qi downward, harmonizing the Stomach, and transforming
phlegm. The assistant ingredients, Poria rubra (chi fu ling),
Glycyrrhizae Radix (gen cdo), Talcum (hud shi), and Indigo
naturalis (qing dai), drain damp-heat through the urine to
open constraint in the Triple Burner.

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula clears heat and transforms dampness. It is con-
traindicated in cases of phlegm-dampness due to yang defi-
ciency.

Commentary

This is a combination of three formulas: Minor Bupleurum
Decoction (xido chdi hu tang), which clears heat constraint
from the lesser yang; Warm Gallbladder Decoction (wen dan
tang), which clears heat, expels phlegm, and regulates the
Gallbladder and Stomach (see Chapter 17); and Jasper Pow-
der (bi yu sin), which clears heat, resolves toxicity, and expels
dampness (see Chapter 5). Artemisiae annuae Herba (ging
hdo) is added to vent the exterior aspect.

The use of Artemisiae annuae Herba (qing hao) as the
chief ingredient gives this formula a milder dispersing action
than Minor Bupleurum Decoction (xido chdi hu tang), whose
chief ingredient is Bupleuri Radix (chdi hu). Artemisiae an-
nuae Herba (qing hdo) is the colder of the two, while its aro-
matic nature makes it a specific herb for transforming damp-
heat constraint in the lesser yang. The original formula uses
only the tips of the fresh plant to focus its action on venting
pathogenic heat to the exterior.

The author of this formula is the Qing-dynasty physician
Yu Gen-Chu from Zhejiang province in southern China. Yu
based his approach to the treatment of seasonal disorders on
cold damage therapeutics, but integrated new approaches to
the treatment of damp-warmth disorders that were then for-
mulated in nearby Jiangsu. These focused particularly on the
functions of the Triple Burner in order to eliminate patho-
genic dampness from the body. This is reflected in the present
formula, which contains Jasper Powder (bi ys sen), an impor-
tant formula in warm pathogen therapeutics.

In fact, it is its function of treating damp-heat or phlegm-
heat in the Triple Burner that has allowed later generations
of physicians to extend the indication of the formula beyond
the narrow domain of seasonal disorders. Sweet Wormwood
and Scutellaria Decoction to Clear the Gallbladder (hao gin
ging dan tang) can clear such pathogens from the course of
the lesser yang channels when they cause symptoms like tin-
nitus, deafness, dizziness, jaundice, hemorrhoids, or urinary
obstruction. It is equally effective in treating systemic mani-
festations of damp-heat such as night sweats, palpitations, or
sleep dysfunctions.

Comparison
> Vs. Minor Bupteurum DecocTion (xido chdi hu ting)

Both formulas treat lesser yang patterns characterized by al-
ternating chills and fever, discomfort in the hypochondria,
nausea, and a bi
