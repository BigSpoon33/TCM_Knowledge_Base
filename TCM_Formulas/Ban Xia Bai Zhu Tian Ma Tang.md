## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
Classic formula for phlegm-dampness generating internal wind, particularly affecting the head. The combination addresses the root (spleen deficiency creating phlegm) and the manifestation (wind symptoms like dizziness). Tian Ma is the key herb for calming internal wind.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows anti-vertigo, neuroprotective, and gastroprotective effects. Tian Ma contains compounds that affect the nervous system and balance. Studies demonstrate efficacy in Ménière's disease, migraines, and vestibular disorders.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for chronic dizziness and headaches related to digestive weakness. Particularly effective for people with "heavy head" sensation and digestive symptoms. Often used long-term for constitutional support in prone individuals.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Cook Ban Xia longer to reduce toxicity, add Sheng Jiang
**Timing**: Between meals, can take with ginger tea
**Duration**: 2-8 weeks for acute symptoms, longer for chronic conditions
