Formulas that Dispel Summerheat and Facilitate the Resolution of Dampness 239

tongue signs reflect relatively mild summerheat-dampness, as
does the soggy (damp) and rapid (summerheat) pulse.

Analysis of Formula

The proper treatment of summerheat requires an outlet. If
accompanied by dampness, summerheat can be relieved by
promoting urination. The chief ingredient, cold, bland Tal-
cum (hud shi), clears summerheat and facilitates the resolu-
tion of dampness. Its nature is heavy, and it therefore directs
downward. It is also slippery and able to facilitate passage
through the apertures, be they the pores of the skin above
or the urinary orifices below. Thus, Li Shi-Zhen considered
Talcum (hud shi) to be an herb for clearing pathogenic heat
from the entire Triple Burner, one whose actions were not
limited to promoting urination. The deputy, Glycyrrhizae
Radix (gen cdo), harmonizes the middle and has a mild abil-
ity to clear heat and resolve toxicity. This combination not
only promotes urination, but also generates fluids, thereby
enabling the formula to perform its tasks without injuring
the qi or fluids.

Cautions and Contraindications

Because this formula may injure the qi and fluids, use with
caution when treating weak, elderly, or yin-deficient patients.
Contraindicated in cases with copious, clear urine or in sum-
merheat without dampness.

Commentary

This formula treats a yang-type summerheat disorder in
Zhang Jie-Bin’s two-fold classification scheme. Its author is
Liu Wan-Su, one of the four great masters of the Jin-Yuan pe-
riod, widely known for his focus on heat and fire pathogens.
Liu Wan-Su recommended the formula for a wide range of
conditions characterized by heat in the interior, matching the
equally wide-ranging influence of Talcum (hud shi) on the
Triple Burner.

[This formula] treats body fever, vomiting, dysentery, diarrhea,
Intestinal lumps with red and white dysentery, urinary block-
age, and painful urinary dysfunction. It promotes urination but
is particularly [useful] for stony painful urinary dribbling. ...

It [also] dissipates qi accumulation, unblocks the nine orifices
and six yang organs, generates body fluids, removes stoppage
and clumping, eliminates built-up water, stops thirst, eases the
middle, eliminates irritability, heat, palpitations, abdominal
distention, pain, and stifling [sensations]. It tonifies and aug-
ments the five yin organs and greatly nourishes the qi of Spleen
and Kidneys. ... In the interior, [it treats] internal damage

[leading to] impotence. It calms the ethereal soul and settles the
corporeal soul, [tonifies] all deficiency, and treats convulsions,
fright palpitations, and forgetfulness, It stops irritability, full-
ness, shortness of breath, and coughing due to damage of the
yin organs. [It helps where] food is not descending, pain in the
muscles and flesh, mouth ulcers, and tooth decay. It brightens
the ears and eyes, strengthens the sinews and bones, unblocks
the blood vessels, harmon
