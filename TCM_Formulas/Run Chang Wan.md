diseases there is often a stage
where the pathogenic influence remains
lodged in the exterior even though it has already
penetrated into the interior. Similar problems may
occur if a person with an interior disorder contracts a
new pathogen, which then obstructs the exterior. In
each case, the patient will present with a combined
exterior-interior disorder.
There are three basic treatment strategies for
dealing with such problems: resolve the exterior

for combined yang brightness and lesser yang
disorders; Seven-Substance Decoction with
Magnolia Bark (hou pd gi wi tang) for combined
yang brightness and greater yang disorders; Kudzu, Scutellar-
ia, and Coptis Decoction (ge gen hudng qin hudng lidn tang)
for yang brightness disorders with heat pathogens in both
the exterior and interior; and Cinnamon Twig and
Ginseng Decoction (gui zhi ren shen tang) for
cold in the interior complicated by wind-cold in
the greater yang. These formulas continue to be
widely used today. They also became the mod-

nario applies where exterior excess is combined with interior
deficiency, as discussed in Chapter 1.

Although the core strategies used in the formulas dis-
cussed here—sweating, warming, cooling, and purging—

This method aims at releasing wind-cold from the exterior
by means of sweating, while simultaneously draining internal
heat via the stool and urine.

In contemporary Chinese medicine, external disorders are
generally divided into heat- and cold-type disorders, while

286 Chapter 7 / Formulas that Release Exterior-Interior Excess

Accurate diagnosis is imperative for successful use of
these formulas. The practitioner must identify which patho-
genic influence is involved, its location (interior or exterior),
and the extent of its development (level or warp) before the
appropriate formula can be selected and modified to match
the precise pattern. Once a formula’s composition and its
indication have been understood, however, its use can be
expanded beyond its original indication to problems facing
every clinician in contemporary practice.

FORMULAS THAT
RELEASE THE EXTERIOR
AND PURGE THE INTERIOR

The formulas in this group are indicated for patterns charac-
terized by the presence of an externally-contracted pathogen
in the exterior while excess accumulation obstructs the inte-
rior. The term ‘interior’ here does not generally refer to the or-
gans as opposed to the channels, but more often to the bowels
associated with the yang brightness as opposed to the greater
and lesser yang warps, or the exterior of the yang brightness
warp itself. This is because heat excess in the interior is typi-
cally a manifestation of a yang brightness pattern.

The patterns treated by formulas in this section are char-
acterized by fever and chills that are accompanied by ab-
dominal fullness, constipation, and a red tongue with a yellow
coating. Formulas that treat these disorders combine herbs
that release the exterior, such as Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui
zhi), Ephedrae Herba (md hudng), Bupleuri Radix (chdi hi),
Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bd he), Schizonepetae Herba
(jing ji2), and Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng), with herbs
that purge accumulation from the interior, such as Rhei Radix
et Rhizoma (da hudng) and Natrii Sulfas (mdng xiao).

Actions Harmonizes and releases the lesser yang, and drains
@ internal clumping due to heat

Indications

Alternating fever and chills, fullness in the chest and hypo-
chondria (with or without pain), a bitter taste in the mouth,
nausea, continuous vomiting, hard focal distention or fullness
and pain in the epigastrium, burning diarrhea or no bowel
movements, melancholy, slight irritability, a yellow tongue
coating, and a wiry, forceful pulse.

This is a concurrent lesser yang and yang brightness-warp
disorder. The alternating fever and chills, sensation of full-
ness in the chest and hypochondria, bitter taste in the mouth,
and wiry pulse are indicative of a lesser yang-warp disorder.
The sensation of firm masses or distention and pain in the
epigastrium, absence of bowel movements or hot, burning
diarrhea, yellow coating on the tongue, and forceful pulse are
indicative of a yang brightness organ-warp disorder. It is not
uncommon to find a flooding or excessive pulse. The yang
brightness signs indicate that the pathogen has moved deeper
into the body. Compared to a purely lesser yang condition,
the heat and constraint are thus more severe. This explains
the symptoms of uncontrolled vomiting, melancholy, and in-
creased irritability.

This formula can also be used for commingled heat with
diarrhea (1424 F #| xie re xia fi). This is a pattern, first out-
lined in Discussion of Cold Damage, where diarrhea is ac-
companied by heat. The term ‘heat’ in this context may denote
fever, that is, an objective rise in body temperature accessible
to the physician by means of palpation, as well as mere sub-
jective sensations experienced by the patient but not acces-
sible to the physician. In both cases, neither the pulse nor the
tongue reflects the presence of heat, which differentiates this
pattern from excess heat yang brightness patterns.

Analysis of Formula

Because it focuses on a combined lesser yang and yang
brightness disorder this formula combines a strategy of har-
monization with one of downward draining. Harmonization
vents the pathogen in the exterior via the lesser yang, while
downward draining expels the heat knotting in the interior.


Formulas that Release the Exterior and Purge the Interior 287

Although normally purging heat from the interior would be
contraindicated in lesser yang disorders, it is permitted here
due to the simultaneous occurrence of a yang brightness in-
terior excess pattern.

This formula has two chief herbs. Bupleuri Radix (chdi
hu) dredges the lesser yang and releases the exterior. Rhei
Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) enters the yang brightness to
drain heat and open the bowels. These functions are ampli-
fied by two deputies. The first, bitter and cold Scutellariae
Radix (hudng qin), combines with Bupleuri Radix (chdi hu)
to clear heat from the lesser yang but also assists Rhei Radix
et Rhizoma (da hudng) in draining heat from the bowels.
The second, Aurantii Fructus immaturus (zhi shi), is a strong
regulator of gi movement that breaks up qi stagnation and re-
duces focal distention and fullness in the chest and abdomen.
When combined with Bupleuri Radix (chdi hi), its ability to
facilitate the flow of qi is greatly strengthened. When com-
bined with Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng), it breaks up
clumping in the bowels.

One of the assistants, Paeoniae Radix (shdo yao), relaxes
urgency and stops pain. In concert with Aurantii Fructus im-
maturus (zhi shi) and Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng), it
treats the pain from excess in the abdomen. The other as-
sistant, Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhi ban xia), harmo-
nizes the middle burner and directs the rebellious Stomach qi
downward. When combined with one of the envoys, Zingib-
eris Rhizoma recens (sheng jiang), it effectively stops the vom-
iting. The other envoy, Jujubae Fructus (da zdo), strengthens
the ability of Paeoniae Radix (shdo yao) to soften the Liver and
reduce abdominal spasms. This combination also protects the
yin from injury by pathogenic heat and from the harsh drain-
ing properties of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) and
Aurantii Fructus immaturus (zhi shi), The combination of
Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jiang) and Jujubae Fructus
(da zdo) mildly regulates the nutritive and protective qi, and
assists in the release of the pathogenic influence.

Commentary

This is the first formula in the history of Chinese medicine
to focus on simultaneously venting heat from the exterior
and draining it from the interior. It is therefore the model on
which all the other formulas in this section are based.

Used for concurrent lesser yang and yang brightness
organ disorders, this formula is based on two formulas that
separately treat each of these single-warp conditions: Minor
Bupleurum Decoction (xido chdi hu tang) for the lesser yang,
and Major Order the Qi Decoction (da cheng qi tang) for the
yang brightness. Ginseng Radix (ren shen) and Glycyrrhizae
Radix preparata (zhi gan cdo) are omitted to prevent the toni-
fying and cloying properties of these herbs from obstructing
the flow, which would aggravate the problems of vomiting
and defecation. Since the abdominal pain is more severe than

the distention, Magnoliae officinalis Cortex (hou pd) and
Natrii Sulfas (mdng xiao) are omitted, and Paeoniae Radix
(shdo yao) is added. Depending on which type of Paeoniae
Radix (shdo yao) is chosen, one can achieve a different effect.
Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi shdo) helps relax urgency by toni-
fying the fluids. Paeoniae Radix rubra (chi shdo) will focus
more strongly on cooling the blood and unblocking stasis.
Although purging is generally inappropriate for lesser yang-
warp disorders, concurrent lesser yang and yang brightness
organ-warp disorders require the use of purgatives to attack
the interior aspect of the problem.

Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng)

Although this formula is found in both Discussion of Cold
Damage and Essentials from the Golden Cabinet, only the lat-
ter lists Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) as an ingredient.
Later commentators therefore argued over whether inclusion
of this herb in the formula is essential. There are three differ-
ent views. The first, represented by the Song text Three Works
on the Discussion of Cold Damage by Xu Shu-Wei, held that
Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) is essential: “Rhei Radix
et Rhizoma (de hudng) is an essential herb in [treating] cold
damage. Its omission from Major Bupleurum Decoction (da
chdi hu tang) must [have been] an error”

The opposite view was expressed by the Ming-dynasty
commentator Ke Qin. In Collected Writings on Renewal of the
Discussion of Cold Damage, Ke argued that in this disorder
the pathogen is just beginning to enter the Stomach organ,
obstructing its opening but not yet its central portion. This
is reflected in the symptoms of hard focal distention in the
epigastric region and diarrhea. These symptoms indicate that
the passages of the bowels are still open, hence the use of Rhei
Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) is not yet necessary,

Finally, in Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and
Respecting the Western, the early modern physician Zhang
Xi-Chun attempted to reconcile these opposing views:

Later generations [of physicians following Zhang Zhong-Jing]
feared the fierceness of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) and
tended to replace it with Aurantii Fructus immaturus (zh! shi).
They [argued] that if a formula did not work, one could then
still add Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) without, however,
removing Aurantii Fructus immaturus (zhi shi). This is the
origin of [the dispute over] why, on one occasion [in Zhang
Zhong-Jing’s works,] the formula Major Bupleurum Decoction
(da chdi hu tang) contains Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng),
and on another it does not.

Most modern textbooks include Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da
hudng), arguing that it is essential to flush clumping heat
from the Intestines. One should also note that, in relation
to the other herbs in the formula, the dosage of Rhei Radix
et Rhizoma (da hudng) is actually very low. Hence, as the
modern physician He Lian-Chen commented: “In addition


288 Chapter 7 / Formulas that Release Exterior-Interior Excess

to harmonizing [the middle] and resolving [the exterior, the
formula] only gently purges.” Most prepared products of this
formula contain Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng).

Usage

Major Bupleurum Decoction (da chdi hu tang) may be used
to treat either diarrhea (due to accumulation of heat in the
Intestines) or constipation. It may also be used for Liver and
Gallbladder fire causing headache, tinnitus, diminished hear-
ing and vision, red eyes, manic behavior, or palpitations with
anxiety if the presentation also includes epigastric fullness
and pain, a bitter taste in the mouth, a red tongue with yellow
coating, and a fast, wiry pulse. Another important modern
usage is wheezing caused by inability of the gi to descend due
to the obstruction of the epigastric area and flanks.

This is also an important formula for treating fevers, and
not just those presenting with alternating heat and cold. More
important is the presence of such markers as tension and
fullness in the flanks and epigastrium aggravated by pres-
sure, and a rather acute and accelerated disease process. Note
that it may be necessary to press quite deeply in those who
are overweight before the characteristic abdominal signs are
elicited, while they will be felt more superficially in those who
are thin.

Comparisons
> Vs. Minor BupLeuruM Decoction (xido chdi hu ting)

Both of these formulas treat lesser yang-warp disorders. How-
ever, a Major Bupleurum Decoction (da xido chdi hu tang)
presentation is characterized by more severe vomiting (rather
than occassional vomiting or just nausea) caused by stronger
heat. Thus, the formula contains a much larger dosage (24g
vs. 9g) of Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jidng). Symptom-
atically, Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jiang) stops nau-
sea and vomiting while functionally, it assists Bupleuri Radix
(chdi hi) in venting the pathogen to the exterior. A Major
Bupleurum Decoction (da chdi hu tang) presentation must
also have symptoms of heat in the yang brightness organ with
clumping, such as abdominal fullness, focal distention, and
pain.

Because Minor Bupleurum Decoction (xido chdi hu tang)
contains herbs that harmonize and tonify the Spleen and
Stomach, it can be used when heat has already been purged
from the interior but some heat still remains in the exterior.
In these cases, the formula not only effectively vents any lin-
gering pathogen but also strengthens the qi of the middle
burner that has been weakened by the prior purgation.

> Vs. BUPLEURUM DECOCTION PLUS MIRABILITE
(chdi hu jid mang xido tang)

Relative to this formula, Major Bupleurum Decoction (da xido

chdi hu tang) focuses on disorders of excess with hard focal
distention of the epigastrium and an absence of injury to the
Stomach qi. The fever will tend to be constant and rise in the
afternoon. By contrast, Bupleurum Decoction plus Mirabilite
(chdi hii jia mdng xido tang) is indicated for constipation and
fullness in the chest and hypochondria with alternating fever
and chills that are more pronounced in the afternoon.

> Vs. Major ORDER THE Qi DECOCTION
(da cheng qi tang); see PAGE 66

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used.
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders. One
group involves the upper digestive system and includes cho-
lecystitis, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, and peptic ulcers as well
as viral hepatitis, enteric fever, and scarlet fever. In these cas-
es, the formula is usually given in high doses as a decoction
in order to produce a rapid effect. The other group involves
metabolic and autonomic disruptions such as diabetes, hy-
pertension, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, and obesity. In these
cases, the formula is usually given in lower doses over longer
periods of time, often in the form of concentrated powders.
