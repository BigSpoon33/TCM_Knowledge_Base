## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
"Six Gentlemen" builds on the "Four Gentlemen" (Si Jun Zi Tang) by adding phlegm-transforming herbs. Perfect formula for modern lifestyle - addresses both qi deficiency and phlegm-dampness accumulation from poor diet and sedentary habits.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows gastroprotective, immunomodulating, and anti-fatigue effects. The combination of qi-tonifying and phlegm-transforming herbs shows synergistic benefits for digestive function and energy levels. Studies demonstrate efficacy in functional dyspepsia.

### Clinical Experience
Extremely practical formula for patients with chronic fatigue and digestive issues. Often more effective than Si Jun Zi Tang alone due to phlegm component. Particularly good for people who feel heavy, sluggish, and have poor digestion.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, simmer Ban Xia longer to reduce toxicity
**Timing**: Between meals for digestive symptoms
**Duration**: 4-12 weeks for chronic conditions
