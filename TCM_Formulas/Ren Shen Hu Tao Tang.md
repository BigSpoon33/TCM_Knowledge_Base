| to Rectify the Qi

* hud xiang zheng qi san

; In its broadest sense, ‘rectify the qi’ (.E &. zheng qi) implies the
capacity to rectify abnormal seasonal qi (#7 BF F EZ & s} sht
bit zheng zhi qi). Besides the six pathogenic qi, there are many

: other types of abnormal seasonal qi, including ‘mountain vapors
= and miasmatic qi’ (+) JA & shan ldn zhang qi), Because this

® formula is acrid and warming in nature, it rectifies only the qi

: that has become abnormal due to the invasion of wind-cold-
dampness or miasmatic qi.
