8 Actions Drains heat from the Lungs and calms wheezing

Indications

Coughing, wheezing, and fever with skin that feels hot to the
touch, all of which worsen in the late afternoon. There is also
a dry mouth, little or difficult-to-expectorate sputum, a thin,
rapid pulse, and a red tongue with a yellow coating.

This is lurking fire due to constrained heat in the Lungs.
This heat causes the Lung qi to rebel, which manifests as

coughing and wheezing. The Lungs govern the skin; lurk-
ing heat in the Lungs causes the skin to feel hot to the touch
with light pressure. This so-called ‘steaming’ heat is thought
to emanate from the skin itself. It should not be confused
with the hot skin associated with a yang brightness-warp dis-
order, which originates in the flesh and feels hot at all levels of
pressure. Constrained heat also injures the yin of the Lungs.
For this reason, the coughing, wheezing, and fever all worsen
in the afternoon when the Lung qi is at its nadir (the most yin
time for the Lungs). This should be distinguished from con-
ditions of Kidney yin deficiency where there is fever only in
the afternoon. The dry mouth, thin and rapid pulse, and red
tongue with a yellow coating are all indicative of heat.

Analysis of Formula

In order to treat constraint caused by lurking fire in the
Lungs, the formula uses a strategy of clearing heat and drain-
ing fire, assisted by calming wheezing to address the symp-
toms. The chief herb, dry-fried Mori Cortex (chdo sang bdi
pi), drains constrained heat from the Lungs and thereby stops
the coughing and wheezing. It combines a moistening nature
with an acrid flavor, allowing it to drain heat without damag-
ing the Lungs, which is regarded as the ‘tender organ. This
is particularly suitable in a formula directed specifically at
children. It is assisted by the deputy, Lycii Cortex (di gui pi),
which is sweet, bland, and bitter. It enters the Kidneys to clear
heat from deficiency and into the Lungs to drain lurking fire.
Essentials of the Materia Medica argues that it is able to vent
heat pathogens from the Lungs that are retained following an
external invasion and float to the surface from time to time
as tidal fevers.

Both the chief and deputy consist of root bark (cortex),
which in Chinese is called ‘skin’ (X pi). In the human body,
the health of the Lungs is reflected in the skin. Traditionally,
therefore, the peel or bark of plants was considered especially
useful for treating the Lungs. If there is more heat from con-
straint than from deficiency, the dosage of the chief herb is
increased; if there is more heat from deficiency, the dosage of
the deputy is increased.

The assistants, Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata (zhi gan
ceo) and Nonglutinous rice (jing mi), protect the Stomach
from the cold properties of the other herbs. In terms of the
mother-child method, they also help the mother (i.e., earth,
which corresponds to the Spleen and Stomach) nurture the
child (i.e., metal, which corresponds to the Lungs).

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula is often modified to protect the Spleen from
injury by the cold-natured herbs in the formula. It is con-
traindicated for coughing and wheezing due to wind-cold,
wind-heat, or damp-phlegm.


Formulas that Clear Heat from the Organs 187

Commentary

The source text refers to the disorder treated by this formula
as ‘Lung overabundance in children’ (+> L4¥  xido er fei
sheng). Not until the Ming and Qing eras did physicians de-
fine the nature of this overabundance as ‘Lung fire’ and pro-
vide a detailed analysis of the disease dynamic and etiology.
With an overabundance of heat, the clearing and clarifying
function of the Lungs is impaired and the qi rebels upward,
producing a high, clear-sounding cough with little sputum.
The heat itself is thought to arise from the oscillation between
excess and deficiency that reflects the immaturely developed
yin and yang in children. This pattern must therefore be dis-
tinguished from both external excess, where pathogenic heat
constrains the diffusion of Lung qi, and internal deficiency,
where an objective lack of fluids and essences is insufficient
to moisten and cool the Lungs. For this reason, the formula
focuses on draining heat without employing excessively cool-
ing or bitter substances such as Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao)
or Scutellariae Radix (hudng gin) that would damage the qi
dynamic; and it tonifies the qi and yin indirectly by strength-
ening earth and clearing deficiency heat rather than relying
on sweet, moistening herbs such as Ophiopogonis Radix (mdi
men deng) or Asparagi Radix (tidn men dong) that would in-
crease stagnation. The famous Qing-dynasty physician Fei
Bo-Xiong concisely summed up this strategy: “Clearing Lung
fire and supplementing the Spleen and Stomach—this is the
method of caring for the mother [in order to treat the child].
If one were to add [bitter, cold herbs that damage the earth
like] Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn), one would let go of the
guiding [principles] laid down within the formula’s composi-
tion.”

Usage in Exterior Conditions

Physicians have long argued whether this formula can be used
when a pathogenic factor is present in the exterior. Symptom,
Cause, Pulse, and Treatment and the Golden Mirror of the
Medical Tradition prescribe modifications of this formula to
treat patterns where exterior wind-cold is tying the protective
qi in the exterior. Systematic Differentiation of Warm Patho-
gen Diseases, on the other hand, contains a famous essay en-
titled “On Why Drain the White Powder (xie bdi sen) Cannot
Be Used Rashly” in which its author, Wu Ju-Tong, explains:

Throughout the ages the commentators on this formula

only discuss its merits but do not [appear to] know about its
drawbacks. ... This formula is excellent for treating cough,
ascending qi, and fever from deficiency in the wake of feverish
disorders or pox in children, if no external pathogen remains
but the true original [qi] is unable to return to its source [in the
gate of vitality]. However, if one uses Mori Cortex (sang bdi pi)
and Lycii Cortex (di git pi) where wind-cold or wind-warmth
truly are in overabundance, or if one adds either of these herbs
to other formulas [in the treatment of such disorders], it is like
pouring oil into a soup. They will plug [the exterior and pro-
duce] clumping, so that [the disorder] cannot be resolved.

The early modern physician Zhang Shan-Lei forefully repeat-
ed this warning, stating that unless there exist clear indica-
tions, use of this formula without significant modification is
best avoided until all external pathogens have been cleared.

Comparisons
> Vs. WHITE TiGER DEecoctTION (bai hu tang)

The basic organization of these two formulas is very similar.
Sweet herbs to tonify earth are combined with substances
that clear heat from the Lungs. Although White Tiger Decoc-
tion (bai hu tang) was originally used to treat yang brightness
disorders, proponents of the warm pathogen disorder current
broadened its scope to include the treatment of greater yin
qi-level heat in the Lungs. It treats the overabundance of heat
with some damage to the yang fluids. This pathology is ef-
fectively controlled by the chief ingredient Gypsum fibrosum
(shi gao), which clears heat in the interior and vents it to the
outside. By contrast, Drain the White Powder (xie bai san) is
indicated for Lung fire occurring against a background of yin
deficiency. The pathology here is one of accumulation, which
its chief herb Mori Cortex (sang bdi pi) effectively drains via
the urine.

>» Vs, EPHEDRA, APRICOT KERNEL, GYPSUM, AND LICORICE
Decoction (md xing shi gan tang)

Both of these formulas treat wheezing and coughing due to
heat constraining the diffusion and downward-directing of
the Lung gi. However, Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Gypsum, and
Licorice Decoction (md xing shi gdn tdng) treats patterns
characterized by heat excess arising either from the contrac-
tion of a cold pathogen that has transformed into heat or from
excess internal heat. In both cases, the heat is pronounced,
and the patient will most likely possess a strong constitution.
Drain the White Powder (xie bdi sadn), on the other hand, is
indicated for Lung fire from constraint against a background
of yin deficiency. This was originally thought to arise from
the delicate balance between yin and yang in children, which
readily allows the yang to escape the control of yin without
either being objectively excessive or deficient. Symptomati-
cally, Drain the White Powder (xie bdi sen) presentations are
often characterized by a sensation of steaming heat in the
afternoons and by skin that is warm to the touch but dry.
Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Gypsum, and Licorice Decoction
(md xing shi gan tang) presentations will typically have light
sweating and signs of excess heat, such as fever and thirst.

: Actions Disseminates Lung qi, clears heat, and unblocks the
orifices (specifically the nose)

Indications

Nasal polyps, nasal congestion, atrophic rhinitis, sinusitis,
and allergic rhinitis.

This formula treats the failure of the Lungs to disseminate
the qi along with accumulation of Lung heat when these re-
sult in nasal congestion or nasal polyps. The patient will often
present with a rapid pulse and a red tongue with a white or
yellow coating.

Analysis of Formula

Magnoliae Flos (xin yi), which disperses wind and unblocks
the nose, serves as the chief herb in the formula. Scutellariae
Radix (hudng gin), Gardeniae Fructus (zhi zi), Anemarrhenae
Rhizoma (zhi mi), and Gypsum fibrosum (shf geo) clear heat
and resolve toxicity. Ophiopogonis Radix (mai men dong)
works with Lilii Bulbus (bdi he) to enrich the yin and moisten
the Lungs so as to offset damage to the Lung yin caused by
the drying herbs in the formula and the stagnant heat inher-
ent in this disorder. These herbs serve as deputies by address-
ing the heat congestion that is at the heart of this pattern.

The assistant herbs concentrate on assisting the chief in-
gredient in unblocking the nose by diffusing the Lung gi and
directing it downward. Eriobotryae Folium (pi pd ye) clari-
fies and descends, thus directing the Lung gi downward and
helping the Lung disseminate the qi. Cimicifugae Rhizoma
(sheng md) raises the clear yang and clears heat and resolves
toxicity. This combination of Eriobotryae Folium (pi pd ye)
and Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng md) regulates the flow of
qi in the upper body so that the turbid qi descends and the
clear qi rises.

Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo) serves as envoy by harmo-
nizing the formula, clearing heat, and resolving toxicity. In
sum, the formula clears the heat from constrained stagnation,
disseminates the Lung qi, and unblocks the nose.

Commentary

This formula is derived from the section on the treatment
of nasal piles (4 4 bi zhi) in Orthodox Lineage of External
Medicine. Here ‘piles’ refers to growths in the nose equivalent
to what Western medicine calls nasal polyps. According to the

text, nasal piles form because the “Lung qi is not clear [lead-
ing to] constrained stagnation of wind and dampness.”

This is a concise way of saying that, because the Lung qi
is not flowing freely to the nose, wind and dampness are not
properly dispelled and dispersed and thus stagnate in the
nose. If this is allowed to continue, the pile grows larger and
larger until it completely blocks the nasal passage. Golden
Mirror of the Medical Tradition cites the same formula for the
treatment of this disorder and adds that, over time, the pile
will turn purple and hard.

The source text says that when this formula is combined
with the local application of a powder called Sal Ammoniac
Powder (ndo shd sdn)* the nasal pile will gradually shrink.
Due to the toxicity of two of the ingredients in this powder,
Realgar (xieng hudng) and Calomelas (qing fen), it cannot be
used in the modern Western clinic. This may explain why the
main use of Magnolia Flower Drink to Clear the Lungs (xin yi
ging fei yin) at present is in the treatment of other outcomes
of the failure of the Lung qi to disseminate and the ensuing
stagnation of wind, dampness, and heat: mostly chronic rhi-
nitis, nasal congestion, sinusitis, and allergic rhinitis. While
surgery is the treatment of choice for most nasal polyps, this
formula can be used postoperatively to prevent recurrence.

Because this formula disseminates the Lung qi and clears
heat, with the addition of cough-relieving agents, it is also
suitable for the treatment of Lung-heat cough with yellow
phlegm. This is particularly true if the Lung-heat pattern in-
cludes nasal congestion. It should be noted, however, that
Magnolia Flower Drink to Clear the Lungs (xin yf qing fei
yin) has little capacity to release pathogens from the body’s
exterior, so it would be inappropriate if the Lung heat is part
of a respiratory disorder that includes signs such as aversion
to wind and cold and a floating pulse. Also, despite the in-
clusion of such yin-tonifying agents as Ophiopogonis Radix
(mai men dong) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mi), the
formula is nevertheless drying and should therefore be used
with caution in patients who exhibit signs of yin or fluid de-
ficiency.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
nasal polyps, sinusitis, rhinitis, atrophic rhinitis or allergic
rhinitis. With modifications, it can also treat chronic cough
or bronchitis.

§ Actions Clears lurking fire from the Spleen and Stomach

Indications

Mouth ulcers, bad breath, thirst, frequent hunger, dry mouth
and lips, a red tongue, and a rapid pulse. Also for tongue
thrusting in children.

This is lurking fire in the Spleen. The Spleen ‘opens through
the mouth, thus Spleen fire is manifested in oral symptoms.
Heat readily transfers from the Spleen to the Stomach (its
paired organ), which leads to thirst and frequent hunger. Heat
in the Spleen can also cause the tongue to become hot, dry,
and red. A red tongue and a rapid pulse are signs of heat. The
tongue is regarded as the ‘sprout’ of the Heart. Why then is
tongue thrusting regarded as a sign of Spleen dysfunction? A
branch of the Spleen channel reaches the root of the tongue
and spreads through its underside. When heat disrupts the
function of the channel, it stimulates the tongue and causes
it to thrust outward. Heat in the Spleen may also cause the
tongue to become hot and dry. It may then thrust out of the
mouth in an effort to cool and moisten itself.

Analysis of Formula

This formula employs a strategy of clearing and dispersing
to drain lurking fire from the Spleen and Stomach. Gypsum
fibrosum (shi gdo), one of the chief ingredients, is acrid and
cooling and is one of the principal herbs for clearing heat
from the middle burner. Gardeniae Fructus (zhi zi), the other
chief ingredient, drains heat from all three burners through
the urine and enters the Heart to relieve irritability. Although
these are the chief ingredients, their dosage is relatively small.
This is to prevent their cooling and descending actions from
further constraining or bottling-up the lurking fire. The large
dosage of Saposhnikoviae Radix (fdng feng), one of the depu-
ties, disperses the lurking Spleen fire in accordance with the
principle of treating constrained fire by dispersal. If the con-
dition is treated simply as a case of Stomach fire to be cleared
and drained, and the dispersing action of this herb is omitted,
there will be no improvement. Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang
feng) also supports the physiological ascending function of
the Spleen yang. Acting in concert, these three ingredients
thus drain fire without injuring the Spleen and Stomach yang,
and disperse constraint without fanning pathological fire.

The second deputy, Pogostemonis/Agastaches Folium
(hud xiang ye), aromatically revives the Spleen. Working to-
gether with Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng), it restores the
qi mechanisms of the Spleen and Stomach and assists in dis-
persing the lurking fire. Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan ceo), honey,
and the wine serve as assistants and envoys. Together they
regulate the middle burner, drain fire, and harmonize the ac-
tions of the other ingredients in the formula.

Cautions and Contraindications

Contraindicated in cases with Stomach yin deficiency and
tongue thrusting due to congenital qi deficiency.

Commentary

The composition of this formula provides an insight to the
proper treatment of lurking heat (fire). Cold substances that
drain heat from the middle burner play a very small role.
What is needed are substances that gently clear and disperse,
as recommended by the Qing-dynasty physician Wang Xu-
Gao: “It is appropriate to drain lurking fire in the Spleen and
Stomach very gently, unlike fire from excess that [needs] to
be drained urgently.” This is another example of flexibly ap-
plying the adage from the Inner Classic, “For fire from con-
straint, discharge it” (X #8 %Z hud yi fa zhi).

Nevertheless, the role of Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang
feng) in the formula has been disputed. The early modern
physician Zhang Shan-Lei, in particular, considered its in-
clusion, especially in such a high dosage, to be a mistake.
He argued that it fans rather than disperses fire and should
therefore be omitted. To settle this question, researchers at the
Nanjing College of Chinese Medicine examined the functions
