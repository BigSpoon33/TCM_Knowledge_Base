## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
"Gui Pi" means "restore the spleen" - emphasizing that the spleen is the source of qi and blood production. Classic formula for the heart-spleen relationship where spleen weakness leads to blood deficiency, which then disturbs the heart spirit. Essential pattern includes both physical weakness and mental-emotional symptoms.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows adaptogenic, antidepressant, and sleep-improving effects. The combination enhances neurotransmitter production and reduces stress hormones. Ginseng and Astragalus boost energy and immune function while spirit-calming herbs improve sleep quality. Studies demonstrate efficacy in insomnia, depression, and chronic fatigue.

### Clinical Experience
Essential formula for people who are "tired but wired" - exhausted but can't sleep properly. Particularly effective for students, caregivers, and professionals with chronic stress leading to fatigue and insomnia. Often used long-term for constitutional support. Best results with stress reduction and good sleep hygiene.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, can cook Suan Zao Ren longer for better effect
**Timing**: Morning and evening doses, evening dose 2 hours before bed
**Duration**: 1-3 months for chronic conditions, often used for maintenance
