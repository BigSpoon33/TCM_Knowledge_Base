Formulas that Warm and Open the Sensory Orifices 497

Cautions and Contraindications

Contraindicated during pregnancy. This formula is used for
acute childhood convulsions associated with a pattern of ex-
cess and is inappropriate for chronic childhood convulsions
due to waning of the Spleen and Kidney yang. If this diagno-
sis cannot be clearly made in a specific case, it is best not to
use the formula.

Commentary

This is an important formula for childhood convulsions. The
key indications are fever, irritability, restlessness, impaired
consciousness, sudden collapse, vomiting, and diarrhea. Not
only does it have the capability of calming down a very seri-
ous, urgent condition in children, but it shows how a wide
variety of ingredients can be well-crafted into one formula.

In this case, there are four groups of ingredients that are
integrated into a whole; those that:

1. Clear the Heart and open the sensory orifices
2. Clear heat and transform phlegm
3, Extinguish wind and stop spasms, and

4. Regulate the gi and harmonize the Stomach.

All four groups are necessary because, by definition, acute
childhood convulsions must be due to an externally-con-
tracted pathogen that invades a child who has preexisting
phlegm from food stagnation that has transformed into heat,
which then stirs up Liver wind.

Because this formula eliminates wind, transforms phlegm,
regulates qi, and harmonizes the Stomach, its use has been
expanded to include indigestion, vomiting, diarrhea, and
coughing in children whenever the presentation involves
stagnation and heat.

Note that not all of the available prepared medicines by
this name have the same formulation. In particular, they often
reduce the dosage or number of acrid, warm substances as
a means of avoiding making the fire and subsequent wind
worse.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
in treating such biomedically-defined disorders as acute en-
cephalitis, acute meningitis, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria,
septicemia, pediatric seizure disorder, seizure disorder, and
severe, acute gastroenteritis.
