Formulas that Release the Exterior and Purge the Interior 287

Although normally purging heat from the interior would be
contraindicated in lesser yang disorders, it is permitted here
due to the simultaneous occurrence of a yang brightness in-
terior excess pattern.

This formula has two chief herbs. Bupleuri Radix (chdi
hu) dredges the lesser yang and releases the exterior. Rhei
Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) enters the yang brightness to
drain heat and open the bowels. These functions are ampli-
fied by two deputies. The first, bitter and cold Scutellariae
Radix (hudng qin), combines with Bupleuri Radix (chdi hu)
to clear heat from the lesser yang but also assists Rhei Radix
et Rhizoma (da hudng) in draining heat from the bowels.
The second, Aurantii Fructus immaturus (zhi shi), is a strong
regulator of gi movement that breaks up qi stagnation and re-
duces focal distention and fullness in the chest and abdomen.
When combined with Bupleuri Radix (chdi hi), its ability to
facilitate the flow of qi is greatly strengthened. When com-
bined with Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng), it breaks up
clumping in the bowels.

One of the assistants, Paeoniae Radix (shdo yao), relaxes
urgency and stops pain. In concert with Aurantii Fructus im-
maturus (zhi shi) and Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng), it
treats the pain from excess in the abdomen. The other as-
sistant, Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhi ban xia), harmo-
nizes the middle burner and directs the rebellious Stomach qi
downward. When combined with one of the envoys, Zingib-
eris Rhizoma recens (sheng jiang), it effectively stops the vom-
iting. The other envoy, Jujubae Fructus (da zdo), strengthens
the ability of Paeoniae Radix (shdo yao) to soften the Liver and
reduce abdominal spasms. This combination also protects the
yin from injury by pathogenic heat and from the harsh drain-
ing properties of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) and
Aurantii Fructus immaturus (zhi shi), The combination of
Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jiang) and Jujubae Fructus
(da zdo) mildly regulates the nutritive and protective qi, and
assists in the release of the pathogenic influence.

Commentary

This is the first formula in the history of Chinese medicine
to focus on simultaneously venting heat from the exterior
and draining it from the interior. It is therefore the model on
which all the other formulas in this section are based.

Used for concurrent lesser yang and yang brightness
organ disorders, this formula is based on two formulas that
separately treat each of these single-warp conditions: Minor
Bupleurum Decoction (xido chdi hu tang) for the lesser yang,
and Major Order the Qi Decoction (da cheng qi tang) for the
yang brightness. Ginseng Radix (ren shen) and Glycyrrhizae
Radix preparata (zhi gan cdo) are omitted to prevent the toni-
fying and cloying properties of these herbs from obstructing
the flow, which would aggravate the problems of vomiting
and defecation. Since the abdominal pain is more severe than
