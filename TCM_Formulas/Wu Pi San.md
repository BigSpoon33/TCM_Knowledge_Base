focus. While Four-Substance Decoction (si wi tang) is better
suited for blood deficiency, it is less able than Arborvitae Seed
Pill for Women’s Disorders (nit ke bdi zi ren wdn) to move the
blood and dispel stasis, nor can it treat the disturbance of the
spirit that is part of the pattern that Arborvitae Seed Pill for
Women’s Disorders (nil ke bdi zi ren wdn) treats. For cases
where blood deficiency is paramount and stasis secondary,
the two formulas can be used together.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
amenorrhea and irregular menstruation.

Modifications

* For severe blood stasis, manifestIng in stabbing pain in the
lower abdomen, purple tongue color, and clotted menstrual
blood, add Verbenae Herba (md bian cdo), Persicae Semen
(tdo ren), Carthami Flos (hdeng hua), and Spatholobi Caulis
(ji xue teng).

¢ If the patient suffers from Spleen-deficient digestive diffi-
culties, replace Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shti di hudng)
with Two-Solstice Pill (er zhi wan).

* For blood-deficient headaches, add Angelicae sinensis Ra-
dix (dang gui) and Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chuan xidng).

¢ For insomnia, add Albiziae Cortex (he hudn pi) and
Spatholobi Caulis (ji xue teng).

* For amenorrhea due to a meager amount of blood, add
Lycopi Herba (ze ldn), Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gut),
Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo), and Paeoniae Radix alba
(bdi shdo). In Golden Mirror of the Medical Tradition, the
combination of these four herbs is called Lycopus Decoc-
tion (ze dn tang).

' painful spasms, and alleviates pain
Indications

Irritability, slight chills, spasms of the calf muscles, and the
absence of coating on the tongue. The formula also treats

cramps in the hands, and abdominal pain that improves with
pressure.

This formula was originally used for the first pattern de-
scribed here, which was said to occur when the inappropriate
use of sweating had injured the blood or yin. At present, it is
used for any type of pain in the calves with blood deficiency
or injury to the fluids. The irritability and lack of tongue
coating are attributed to injury to the yin. The slight chills
are due to weakness of the yang that follows injury to the
yin, and may not always be present. The spasms, cramps, and

tations that are commonly associated with patterns of L
