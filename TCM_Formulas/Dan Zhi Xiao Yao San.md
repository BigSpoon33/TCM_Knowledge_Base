rectum, and various types of internal bleeding. In all cases,
the blood is pale and the bleeding is accompanied by cold
extremities, a wan complexion, pale tongue, frail pulse, and
other symptoms indicating middle burner cold.

Other presentations include chronic childhood convul-
sions (% K jing feng) characterized by emaciation, cold
hands and feet, vomiting, and diarrhea; spitting of frothy sa-
liva during the recovery stage of an illness; sudden turmoil
disorder with cold marked by an absence of thirst; and chest
painful obstruction characterized by rigid focal distention in
the heart region, a sense of fullness in the chest, and pain in
the hypochondria that shoots toward the heart.

When the Spleen yang is deficient, the clear yang can-
not ascend, which causes diarrhea with watery stools. When
the Stomach loses its ability to make the turbid yin descend,
nausea and vomiting ensue. The loss of appetite is indica-
tive of Spleen deficiency. When cold invades the abdomen, it
causes contraction, and thus pain. This process is reflected in
the saying, “When the yang is deficient, the yin ascends.” The
absence of thirst is indicative of cold. Cold from deficiency is
also reflected in the pale tongue with a white coating and the
submerged, thin pulse.

The Spleen governs the blood, and the power of qi con-
tains the blood. Cold invading the middle burner or insuf-
ficiency of Spleen yang impairs these functions. If the Spleen
qi lacks the power to contain the blood, bleeding may oc-
cur throughout the body. This disease dynamic is aptly sum-
marized by Tang Zong-Hai in Discussion of Blood Patterns:
“When the classics state that the Spleen governs the blood,
(they mean that] the movement of blood above and below
depends entirely on the Spleen. If the Spleen yang is deficient,
it is unable to govern the blood”

Chronic childhood convulsions (% A. jing feng) are at-
tributed to disharmony of the protective and nutritive qi due
to insufficient development of middle burner yang. This is
manifested in such symptoms as emaciation, cold hands and
feet, vomiting, and diarrhea. Spitting of frothy saliva in the
recovery stage of an illness indicates damage to the Spleen
yang, which is unable to contain the yang fluids.

Sudden turmoil disorder can be caused by an external
cold pathogen that directly attacks the middle burner, espe-
cially where the Spleen and Stomach are deficient due to ir-
regular eating and a poor diet. Damage to the middle burner
yang qi results in insufficient separation of the clear and tur-
bid, as well as a disorder in the ascending and descending
actions of the qi dynamic, which manifests in vomiting and
diarrhea.

Chest obstruction is characterized by exuberance of yin
and deficiency of yang. The cold of deficiency in the middle
burner slows down the movement of qi, causing the yin fluids
and blood to stagnate in the chest. Yin occupying the position
of yang manifests as rigid foca
