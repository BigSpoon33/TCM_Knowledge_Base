Formulas that Drive Out Excess Water 93

Yu’s Achievement Powder
® Yu gong san

The Great Yu was the last legendary leader of China’s prehistoric
| tribal confederation. He is famous for having tamed the great

i floods of the Yellow River, a job in which his father had failed

§ and that took him and his workers 13 years to accomplish. His

| success came to be known as ‘Yu's achievement’ (& #4 Yui gong).
& This formula drives out edema that floods the body, an achieve-
| ment likened to that of the Great Yu.

: Pharbitidis Semen (qian niti zi)... 600 ee 120g

& reduces edema

Indications

Generalized floating edema, abdominal distention, wheezing
and fullness, constipation, urinary difficulty, and a submerged
and forceful pulse. There may also be swelling and distention
of the scrotum accompanied by a feeling of heaviness and
pain, dampness, sweating, and reduced urination.

This is yang edema caused by water dampness invad-
ing the body and obstructing the qi dynamic. Water damp-
ness collecting in the muscles and skin manifests as floating
edema of the entire body. Water and qi accummulating in the
interior and obstructing the qi dynamic leads to inhibited
urination, constipation, wheezing, and fullness of the abdo-
men. As water dampness enters the blood vessels, it causes
the pulse to become submerged. The forcefulness of the pulse
reflects the constrained normal qi.

The same disease dynamic can also manifest as a wa-
ter bulging disorder (7 4h shii shan). Here water dampness,
which by its nature is a yin pathogen, accumulates in the
lower burner, causing scrotal swelling and distention. Heavi-
ness and pain indicate that the movement of qi has become
obstructed. Functionally, this obstruction leads to reduced
urination. Accumulated water dampness may seep to the out-
side instead, causing the scrotal region to become moist. This
is referred to as ‘damp sweating’ (374 shi han).

Analysis of Formula

Although yang water and water bulging are two distinct dis-
orders in Chinese medicine, their underlying disease dynamic
is the same. For this reason, they can be resolved by applying
the same strategy of driving out water and moving the qi.

This formula uses cold and bitter Pharbitidis Semen (qian
niti zi) as the chief herb. Its nature is to direct downward. It
excels at reducing edema by promoting urination and driv-
ing out water by means of purgation. The deputy is Foeniculi
Fructus (xido hut xiang), which moves qi and stops pain. Its
warmth moderates the cold nature of the chief herb, while its
acrid nature aids restoration of the normal qi dyna
