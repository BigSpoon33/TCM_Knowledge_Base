Blood-nourishing herbs support hematopoiesis and circulation. Studies demonstrate benefits in chronic fatigue, immune dysfunction, and post-illness recovery.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for profound weakness and exhaustion from chronic illness, cancer treatment, or constitutional deficiency. Particularly effective for people who need comprehensive support for multiple organ systems. Often used long-term for constitutional rebuilding. Best results with gradual increase in activity and stress reduction.

**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 9-12g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, can be taken as pills for long-term use
**Timing**: Morning and evening doses, take with warm water
