© The name of this formula is generally thought to be related to the
chief ingredient, either because it is the color of peach blossoms,
as suggested by Zhang Zhi-Cong, or because it is also known

as peach blossom stone (#6764 tdo hud shi), as explained by

Li Shi-Zhen. A very different derivation was suggested by Wang
Zi-Jie: “Peach Blossom Decoction is not so named because of its
color. It is used [to treat] yang deficiency of the Kidney organ.
[Its effect] is like the warmth [of the spring] returning to a cold
winter valley. Hence the name.”

Actions Warms the middle, dispels cold, binds up the bowels,
and stops dysenteric disorders

SORE a

Indications

Chronic dysenteric disorders with dark blood and pus in the
stool, abdominal pain that responds favorably to local pres-
sure or warmth, a pale tongue, and a pulse that is slow and
frail or faint and thin.

The first stages of a dysenteric disorder are usually due to
damp-heat, but over time the Spleen and Stomach are injured
and the condition transforms into one of cold from deficiency
and the loss of fluids. Deficiency of the middle burner (Spleen
and Stomach) yang combined with weak fire in the lower
burner prevents food from being digested, transformed, or
transported, and inhibits the metabolism of water. This leads
to internal obstruction of damp-cold, which disrupts the qi
mechanism of the Large Intestine. The obstruction and dis-
ruption injure the collaterals of the Intestines, and dark blood
and pus appear in the stool. The lack of bright color in the
blood, the presence of pus, and the absence of a strong odor
distinguishes this disorder from that caused by damp-heat.
Abdominal pain that responds favorably to local pressure
or warmth is a classic symptom of Spleen and Kidney yang
deficiency. The pale tongue, and the pulse that is slow and
frail] or faint and thin, also reflect weakness of the Spleen and
Kidney yang.

Analysis of Formula

This formula employs three strategies first outlined in Basic
Questions—bind that which is dispersing, warm that which
is cold, and tonify that which is deficient—in order to treat
unremitting diarrhea or dysentery due to yang deficiency.
The chief ingredient, warming and astringent Halloysitum
rubrum (chi shi zhi), binds up the Intestines and stabilizes
the abandoned disorder. Due to its warming nature, it is
particularly useful for treating blood and pus in the stool
due to cold from deficiency. Half of the formula is taken as
a powder so that the substance itself reaches the Intestines;
this will increase its absorptive action. The deputy ingredi-
ent, Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jidng), calms the middle burner
and expels cold. Assisting the original yang, it revitalizes the
Spleen’s transportive and transformative functions so that
it is able once more to contain essence. The contemporary
physician Zhang Xi-Chun argues that because the formation
of pus in the pattern treated by this formula is due to cold,
Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jidng) has the additional functions
of dispelling cold from the blood by means of its warmth and
of opening stasis by means of its acridity, thereby effectively
dealing with the root and branch of pus formation. The assis-
tant, Nonglutinous rice (jing mi), nourishes the Stomach and
harmonizes the middle burner. It helps the other ingredients
improve the function of the Stomach and Intestines.

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula is astringent and warming in nature and there-
fore contraindicated for dysenteric disorders due to damp-
heat. Such patterns are treated by formulas like Peony De-
coction (shdo yao tang), Scutellaria Decoction (hudng gin
tang), or Pulsatilla Decoction (bdi tou weng tang), discussed
in Chapter 4.

Commentary

While this formula warms the middle and binds up the In-
testines, its tonifying action is minimal. Without significant
modification, it is therefore used only in treating the branch,
and not the root, of this disorder. After the diarrhea has
stopped, other formulas should be used to treat the root. This
is reflected in the source text, which states that its administra-
tion may be discontinued after just one dose, provided the
diarrhea stops.

This formula was first mentioned in Discussion of Cold
Damage (paragraph 306) where it is recommended for “lesser
yin disorders with dysenteric diarrhea and pus and blood in
the stools.” The text goes on to mention a number of other
symptoms that may be observed in this pattern. They include
abdominal pain, urinary difficulty, incessant diarrhea, and
blood in the stools. Some commentators think that the pres-
ence of symptoms that do not directly relate to the stools, that
is, abdominal pain and urinary dysfunction, constitute key


428 Chapter 9 / Formulas that Stabilize and Bind

markers for successfully using the formula in clinical prac-
tice. This has allowed contemporary physicians to expand
its use to patterns of cold from deficiency occurring in the
context of disorders such as rectal abscesses, bowel cancer,
hemorrhoids, or anal fistulae. The modern Shanghai physi-
cian Cheng Men-Xue (cited in Contemporary Explanations
of Ancient Formulas) provides one of the clearest differentia-
tions of these symptoms:

When using Peach Blossom Decoction (tdo hud tang) to treat
pus and blood in the stools, abdominal pain, and dysenteric
diarrhea, the pain must be chronic with a slow pulse and a dark
complexion or other distinctive manifestations of cold. The
pus in these [cases] is leakage and loss of intestinal mucous
lubricant with a jelly-like appearance like that of fish brain. The
bleeding [is caused] by internal damage to the yin collaterals
and has a pale black color, or it will be stagnant, dark, and not
fresh. The abdominal pain is not due to stagnation, nor heat,
but to the cold of deficiency damaging the Intestines, thus, it
will respond very favorably to warmth and pressure. These
[signs] are very different from the abdominal pain, pus, and
bleeding [that accompany] heat-type dysenteric disorders.

Because dysenteric diarrhea is usually associated with damp-
heat, Cheng’s statement that this is a lesser yin disorder sug-
gests that it is a relatively chronic problem involving deficient
Kidney yang and loss of absorptive capacity in the lower
burner. Historically, there has been disagreement about the
etiology of this disorder. Some commentators believe that it
results from a transfer of heat to the lesser yin channel, while
others believe that it is due primarily to cold from deficiency
in the lower burner. At present, both etiologies are accepted.

Comparisons
> Vs. YELLOW Eartu Decocrion (hudng tu tang)

Both of these formulas from Essentials from the Golden Cabi-
net can be used to treat blood in the stools associated with
yang deficiency. They are very similar in terms of their com-
position in that each uses a mineral substance to bind up
the Intestines and stop bleeding, Halloysitum rubrum (chi
shi zhi) versus Terra flava usta (zdo xin tu); a warming, ac-
rid herb to assist the original yang, Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan
jiang) versus Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi); and
a sweet herb to tonify the middle, Nonglutinous rice (jing
mi) versus Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo). However, whereas
Peach Blossom Decoction (tdo hud tang) treats lesser yin pat-
terns where the blood congeals due to excess cold, character-
ized by dark-colored blood and pus, Yellow Earth Decoction
(hudng ti tang) treats bleeding due to damp-heat penetrating
into the blood aspect, characterized by fresh-looking blood.
For this reason it also includes bitter, cold Scutellariae Radix
(hudng gin) in order to drain damp-heat, as well as Rehman-
niae Radix preparata (shu di hudng) and Asini Corii Colla (e
jido) to harmonize the blood.

> Vs. TRuE Man’s DEcOcTION TO NOURISH THE ORGANS
(zhen ren yang zang tang)

Both of these formulas warm and tonify the Spleen yang in
order to treat unremitting diarrhea and dysentery, but they
differ in their focus and composition. True Man’s Decoction
to Nourish the Organs (zhen ren ydng zang tang) uses a very
large dose of Papaveris Pericarpium (ying si: ke) as its chief
ingredient and thus focuses primarily on stopping excessive
bowel movements. Secondarily, it tonifies and warms the mid-
dle burner qi and also tonifies the blood. It is thus indicated
primarily for Spleen gi and yang deficiency leading to severe
diarrhea. Peach Blossom Decoction (tdo hud tang), on the
other hand, focuses on warming and binding the Large Intes-
tine, employing Halloysitum rubrum (chi shi zhi) to bind up
the Intestines and stop the bleeding. Although the pattern it
treats often results from yang deficiency of the middle burner,
its focus is on treating the manifestation. Clinically, the use
of this formula should be followed by one that treats the root
once the acute symptoms have been relieved.

The source text prescribes this formula to treat incessant diarrhea
that does not respond to the use of formulas that leach out damp-
ness, treat damp-heat, or warm the interior. According to the com-
mentators, this suggests that the treatment must focus on the lower
burner and on binding up the Intestines. In contrast to the principal
formula, Halloysite and Limonitum Decoction (chi sht zhi yui yii lidng
tang) focuses only on binding up the Intestines and not on assisting
the original yang. It is thus unsuitable for treating patterns charac-
terized by the discharge of blood and pus, indicating stasis of blood
due to cold.

Actions Warms and tonifies the Spleen and Kidneys, binds up
the Intestines, and stops diarrhea

Indications

Diarrhea that occurs daily just before sunrise, lack of inter-
est in food and inability to digest what is eaten, soreness of
the lower back with cold limbs, fatigue and lethargy, a pale
tongue with a thin, white coating, and a submerged, slow, and
forceless pulse. There may also be abdominal pain.

This is daybreak diarrhea (2 29% wii geng xie), also
called ‘cock-crow diarrhea’ because it occurs every day just
before sunrise. This is the time of day when the yin is at its
peak and the yang is starting to rise. Because this is the yang
within the yin, diarrhea occurring at this time reflects a prob-
lem of yin transforming into yang, or yang rising out of the
yin. Yang also refers to fire, and yin to water. If the fire at the
gate of vitality (source yang) is weak, the yang will not prop-
erly rise and the yin will suddenly descend, causing diarrhea
at this time.

As explained in more detail in the COMMENTARY below,
the pathodynamic that leads to this manifestation involves the
Kidneys’ governance of opening and closing, the Spleen func-
tions of transportation and transformation, and the Liver’s
ability to control the spreading of ministerial fire throughout
the body. When the yang of the Spleen and Kidneys is defi-
cient, there is a lack of interest in food, and because the defi-
cient Spleen yang is unable to ‘cook’ or decompose food, what
is eaten is not digested. Pain results from cold contracting the
abdomen as a result of the Liver being unable to disseminate
fire. The Spleen governs the limbs, and the lower back is the
province of the Kidneys; yang deficiency of these organs leads
to soreness of the lower back and cold limbs. When the yang
is deficient, the spirit cannot become fully animated. This lack
of animation is manifested in fatigue, lethargy, and a ‘dispir-
ited’ demeanor. A pale tongue with a thin, white coating and a
submerged, slow, and forceless pulse are characteristic of cold
from deficiency.

Analysis of Formula

This formula treats patterns due to insufficient fire at the gate
of vitality, which is unable to supply the Kidneys and Spleen
with the warmth they require to carry out their transforma-
tive processes. To treat the ensuing diarrhea, this formula em-
ploys a dual strategy of warming and binding to deal with
both the root and branch. The chief herb is acrid, bitter, and
warm Psoraleae Fructus (bu gu zhi). It directly tonifies the
gate of vitality and benefits earth (Spleen) by fortifying this
aspect of fire. It also has an astringent nature that acts on the
Kidneys to secure the primal yang, and on the Spleen to stop
the diarrhea. According to Commentary on the Divine Hus-
bandman’s Classic of Materia Medica, it generates yang from
within yin, thus making it an ideal herb for the treatment of
daybreak diarrhea from yang deficiency. The deputy, Myristi-
cae Semen (ru dou kou), warms the Spleen and Kidneys and
binds up the Intestines. It works synergistically with the chief
herb by focusing its actions on the Intestines. It is often used
to treat lack of appetite due to cold from deficiency.

One of the assistants, Evodiae Fructus (wu zhi yi), dis-
perses cold in the middle burner (Spleen and Stomach) and
thereby complements the action of the chief herb (which
warms the source of the prenatal qi) by warming the source


430 Chapter 9 / Formulas that Stabilize and Bind

of the postnatal qi. Entering the Liver channel, it dredges
Liver constraint, promoting the movement of qi and stopping
pain, all of which are aspects of this pattern. The other assis-
tant, Schisandrae Fructus (wt wei zi), is a strong, warm, and
astringent herb that strengthens the deputy’s ability to bind
up the Intestines. It also works synergistically with Evodiae
Fructus (wii zhi yui), one herb being warm, acrid, drying, and
strongly dispersing, the other sour, sweet, and astringent. The
envoys, which are added to the decoction but removed before
the pills are made, include Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng
jiang), which disperses cold and activates the metabolism
of water, and Jujubae Fructus (da zdo), which nourishes the
Spleen and Stomach.

When the Spleen and Kidneys are warmed and the Large
Intestine is stabilized, the transformation and transportation
of foodstuffs will resume, and the diarrhea will stop.

Cautions and Contraindications

Without modification, this formula should not be used if
there is accumulation or stagnation in the Stomach or In-
testines. One should also avoid raw or cooling foods while
taking this formula.

Commentary

This formula is very effective for daybreak diarrhea. It was
devised by the Ming-dynasty physician Xue Ji, a strong pro-
ponent of warming and tonification who emphasized organ
systems as core rubrics in pattern differentiation. Like many
other physicians associated with this current of thought, Xue
Ji focused particularly on the Spleen and Kidneys as the two
organ systems whose physiological agencies he viewed as most
closely intertwined with the functions of the original yang.
Thus, the original indications of this formula were “deficiency
and frailty of Spleen and Kidneys, soft stools, and disinter-
est in food, [and] also patterns [characterized] by diarrhea
and abdominal pain.” To treat this pattern, Xue combined
two existing formulas from Xu Shu-Wei’s 12th-century book,
Formulas of Universal Benefit from My Practice: Two-Miracle
Pill (er shen wen), composed of Psoraleae Fructus (bi git zhi)
and Myristicae Semen (rou dou kou), and Schisandra Pill (wi
wei zi san), composed of Evodiae Fructus (wu zhit yti) and
Schisandrae Fructus (wit wei zi). The first of these formulas
treated “deficiency and frailty of Spleen and Kidneys with to-
tal disinterest in food,’ the second “Kidney diarrhea,’ a term
equated by some authors with daybreak diarrhea. It is via this
association that the new formula came to be regarded as the
exemplar for the treatment of this disorder.

Our brief genealogy of Four-Miracle Pill (si shen wan)
allows two important observations regarding the use of this
formula in the clinic. First, its use is not limited in any strict
sense to daybreak diarrhea, but extends more widely to pat-
terns presenting with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and lack of

appetite. All of these reflect deficiency of the fire at the gate of
vitality that extends, in particular, to the Spleen and Kidneys.
Secondly, inasmuch as the formula does treat daybreak diar-
thea, its use of Evodiae Fructus (wi zhii yu) and Schisandrae
Fructus (wii wei zi) is of particular significance. The joint ac-
tion of these herbs, which combine acrid and warming disper-
sion with sweet and sour restraining, is a classic strategy for
tonifying the function of constrained Liver yang attributable
to cold from deficiency. There is no particular reason why di-
arrhea due to Kidney and Spleen yang deficiency should only
occur at daybreak. It is more likely that such deficiency will
manifest with diarrhea that has no fixed pattern or that is ag-
gravated by the intake of cold foods. An understanding of the
Liver’s role in the dissemination of ministerial fire is needed
to fully grasp the disease dynamic that leads to daybreak di-
arrhea (i.e., diarrhea that only occurs at this time).

If the Kidney is in control of the storage and release
(opening and closing) of the ministerial fire produced in the
gate of vitality, the Liver is in charge of its dispersal through-
out the three burners. If this dispersal is constrained by Liver
deficiency, it will manifest in a manner typical of Liver wood
pathology: suddenly, rebelliously, and at a moment that re-
flects the transformation of yin into yang corresponding to
the terminal yin. All of these are present in daybreak diarrhea.
In addition, the Chinese medical literature associates day-
break diarrhea with other Liver-related problems: food and
alcohol accumulation, for instance, as well as Liver fire. Many
commentators, too, have been explicit about the contribution
of Liver constraint to the pattern treated by Four-Miracle Pill
(si shen wan). Ke Qin’s discussion in Golden Mirror of the
Medical Tradition is one of the most perceptive:

Diarrhea is an abdominal disorder, and the abdomen is where
all three yin meet. A loss of regulation in any one organ can lead
to diarrhea. Therefore, Zhang Zhong-Jing devised formulas that
master diarrhea from [disorders] of the three yin. ... However,
even if for one organ there are six different strategies, when all
three organs connect with each other [in causing the problem],
it would remain for a long time without ever being cured, such
as the symptom of having diarrhea after the first watch [i.e.,
after 1 A.M.]. [The treatment methods] had not yet reached
this [problem].

Now, from the time the cock crows to daybreak, [although]
the sky is dark, it is {the time] of yang within the yin. When the
yang qi should arrive but does not, a deficient pathogen is able
to remain without being expelled, causing diarrhea at dawn.
This has four reasons: first, a deficient Spleen unable to control
water; second, a deficient Kidney unable to move water; third,
frail fire at the gate of vitality unable to generate earth; fourth, a
lesser yang whose qi is too deficient to spread out. Acting as an
assistant, the acridity and warmth of Evodiae Fructus (wi zhi
yt) is used to expedite the propensity that the Liver wood has
to disperse, thereby opening the way for water qi to propagate
[allowing the body] to receive spring’s generation.

Over the centuries, physicians developed the formula further
by following three basic strategies:
