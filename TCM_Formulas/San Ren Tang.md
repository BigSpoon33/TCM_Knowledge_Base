Comparisons

> Vs. TANGKUEI DecocTion TO ToNIFY THE BLoop (dang
gui bu xuee tang) AND RESTORE THE SPLEEN DECOCTION

(gui pi tang)

All three formulas can be used to tonify the blood and treat
heavy menstruation, or blood deficiency resulting from heavy
menstruation. Both Tangkuei Decoction to Tonify the Blood
(dang gui bu xue tang) and Restore the Spleen Decoction (gui
pi tang) tonify the qi in order to tonify the blood. Another
way to put this is that they improve the assimilation functions
of the Spleen and Stomach in order to facilitate the produc-
tion of blood. Because the Spleen manages blood by provid-
ing the qi that contains it, both of these formulas are also
used to treat excessive bleeding: the former is used for acute
blood loss, while the latter is better for chronic conditions
accompanied by signs of Spleen deficiency. Both formulas
combine Astragali Radix (hudng qi) and Angelicae sinensis
Radix (dang gui) in order to focus the qi on the production
and containment of blood,

Four-Substance Decoction (si wit tang) focuses on the
Liver and on the Governing and Conception vessels. It aims
to tonify the blood in its role as an essence rather than the
functions that produce and manage it, even if, as Wu Kun
points out in Investigations of Medical Formulas, this also
involves the digestive functions of the middle burner:

Plants are not sentient. How can they then generate blood?
When one says that the [herbs in this formula] generate blood,
one meanis that Paeoniae Radix (shdo yao) and Rehmanniae Ra-
dix preparata (shi di hudng) are able to nourish the yin of the
five yin organs, and that Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chudn xiong)

is able to regulate the qi within the nutritive [aspect]. When the
five yin organs function harmoniously, they generate blood. If
one says that the four substances [themselves] generate blood,
then this is not so. The master says: When the blood is deficient,
one can use this formula to regulate [the condition and produc-
tion of blood]. However, in [cases of] excessive blood loss from
either the upper or lower [body orifices] accompanied by the
symptom of [labored] breathing, use of the four substances is
forbidden.

In clinical practice, the patterns of blood deficiency for which
Four-Substance Decoction (si wit tang) is indicated will thus
invariably show signs of dryness because essence is lacking.
The digestive function, on the other hand, is not impaired. By

contrast, Restore the Spleen Decoction (gui pi tang) patterns
are characterized by the presence of dampness that comes
from Spleen deficiency. Tangkuei Decoction to Tonify the
Blood (dang gui bii xue tang) is differentiated from both for-
mulas by its use in acute bleeding patterns.

Drains fire, resolves toxicity, tonifies the blood, and stops bleed-
ing. For chronic, continuous, and excessive uterine bleeding due to
heat accompanied by pale complexion, stabbing pain in the abdo-
men, and alternating fever and chills. This is a combination of Four-
Substance Decoction (si wit tang) and Coptis Decoction to Resolve

Toxicity (hudng lidn jie du tang), discussed in Chapter 4. The name
refers to the formula’s ability to warm the chills that often accompany
blood deficiency (blood is the substratum that carries the warmth of
yang qi around the body), while simultaneously clearing heat from
the blood, which in this case is the cause of the blood deficiency
(blood heat consumes yin blood). In clinical practice, this is reflect-
ed in symptoms like heat in the upper body while the lower body
is cold, irritability and restlessness despite fatigue and exhaustion,
a submerged but rapid pulse, and a dry tongue with a red tip and a
thin white coating. At present, this formula is also commonly used
for stubborn skin diseases such as eczema, dermatitis, and urticaria
characterized by dry, itchy, and inflamed skin.

¥ Actions Tonifies the qi and generates blood

Indications

Hot sensation in the muscles, a red face, irritability, thirst with
a desire to drink warm beverages, a pale tongue, and a flood-
ing, large, and deficient pulse that is forceless when pressed
hard. Also for fever and headache due to loss of blood.

This is a pattern of heat from deficiency characterized
by blood deficiency and floating yang. Blood stores qi by
providing a substance to which its dynamic can attach itself.
When the blood is deficient, the yin is then unable to contain
the yang, which floats to the superficial aspects of the body.
This is explained by Tang Zong-Hai in Discussion of Blood
Patterns: “When the blood is deficient, this [manifests with]
fever and sweating. For when the blood does not match the
qi, the qi becomes exuberant and discharges to the outside.”
Symptomatically, the classic signs of ‘floating yang’ include
a hot sensation in the muscles, a red face, irritability, and
thirst with a desire for warm beverages. The definitive (al-
most pathognomonic) sign is the flooding, large, and defi-
cient pulse that reflects perfectly the weak yang qi dilating in


Formulas that Tonify the Blood 339

an attempt to reach the superficial parts of the body. The pale
tongue is indicative of blood deficiency. The same pathologi-
cal mechanism underlies the fever that follows a severe loss of
blood. In these cases, headache occurs because the process is
relatively acute and therefore has some force behind it: when
the yang floats to the head, it causes pain.

Analysis of Formula

In the pattern treated by this formula, blood deficiency is
the root, but floating yang is the primary external manifesta-
tion or branch. Blood is difficult to generate, while qi easily
disperses. Following the adage, “In acute conditions treat the
branch,’ the formula thus focuses on preventing the qi from
discharging. For this purpose, the formula employs a large
dosage of Astragali Radix (hudng qf) as its chief herb. Astrag-
ali Radix (hudng qi) not only strongly tonifies the original qi
of the Spleen, but also secures the exterior, as explained in
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica: “Its cortex
reaches directly to the exterior skin and muscle, securing the
protective yang and amply filling the exterior level. These are
its specific strengths, so it is really marvelous for all disorders
involving exterior deficiency.“ Turning this qi inward will, in
turn, facilitate the production of blood, which is produced by
the qi transformations of the middle burner. Furthermore,
augmenting qi also supports movement and transformation,
and thereby reinforces the generation of blood on a second
level. A smaller dosage of Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui)
is utilized as a deputy to address the root cause. Among the
blood-tonifying herbs, Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui)
in particular is used here for two reasons. First, it tonifies but
also invigorates the blood, and therefore works better in gen-
erating new blood than do other, more cloying substances.
In a related manner, it also replenishes the ‘gi of the blood’
and therefore works particularly well in conjunction with As-
tragali Radix (hudng qi), which indirectly tonifies the blood
by tonifying the qi, as previously explained.

Cautions and Contraindications
Use with caution in cases with tidal fever from yin deficien-
cy.

Commentary
Original and Later Indications

Like many other formulas composed by the Jin-dynasty phy-
sician Li Dong-Yuan, this formula treats a pattern character-
ized by the fever of deficiency as its main manifestation. On
first glance, the symptoms (fever, irritability, thirst, a red face,
and a flooding, large pulse) are similar to those of a White
Tiger Decoction (bdi hii tang) pattern. However, the latter
formula is used for treating a yang brightness pattern char-
acterized by manifestations typical of excess: high fever with
profuse sweating, strong thirst for cold beverages, and an ex-

cessive pulse. This formula, by contrast, is for a pattern of
blood deficiency characterized by manifestations typical of
deficiency: low fever, slight sweating, a thirst for warm bever-
ages, and a deficient pulse. Needless to say, prescribing one of
these formulas when the other is indicated could have disas-
trous consequences.

In the literature, the pattern treated by this formula is
commonly associated with consumptive fatigue (## Ido
juan), a form of blood deficiency caused by injury to the
source qi. This disorder was first described in Basic Ques-
tions, Chapter 62: “With what is called consumptive fatigue,
the qi of the form is debilitated and meager. The qi from
food does not ascend, and there is no movement in the upper
burner; nor is the lower epigastrium open. The Stomach qi
becomes hot [from constraint] and the heat sears the chest.
Therefore, there is internal heat.’ This suggests that internal
injury from consumptive fatigue depletes the source qi, which
in turn causes the nutritive qi and blood to become deficient.
Li Dong-Yuan attributed such deficiency to lack of food, pov-
erty, and overwork, and proposed a strategy of sweet, warm-
ing tonification as key to treating the resulting patterns. The
combination of Astragali Radix (hudng qi) and Angelicae si-
nensis Radix (dang gui) reflects this approach and is found
in many other of Li Dong-Yuan's formulas, most importantly
Tonify the Middle to Augment the Qi Decoction (bu zhong yi
qi tang). Taking up these ideas, later physicians incorporated
the combination into many other important formulas, includ-
ing Restore the Spleen Decoction (gui pi tang), Tangkuei and
Six-Yellow Decoction (dang gui lii hudng tang), and Tonify
the Yang to Restore Five-Tenths Decoction (bi ydng hudn wii
tang).

The range of indications for the present formula itself was
also expanded over time. One of its major uses at present is
for bleeding associated with deficient qi failing to control the
blood. Another very common use is in the treatment of sores
that do not heal for a long period of time after ulcerating, but
continue to exude a thin, pale fluid. These are called ‘yin-type
ulcers’ and are attributed to weakness of the protective qi and
blood, which inhibits the normal healing process. In this case,
the formula acts to support the protective qi, resolve toxicity,
and generate flesh to heal the sore.

Debates about Action and Usage

That the formula treats blood deficiency but uses a qi-toni-
fying herb as its main ingredient has led to intense debates
among commentators regarding the precise functions of As-
tragali Radix (hudng qi). Five distinct positions have emerged
in these debates:

* The first, represented by Wu Kun in Investigations of Medi-
cal Formulas, holds that Astragali Radix (hudng qf) “toni-
fies the qi in order to tonify the blood? based on the view


340 Chapter 8 / Formulas that Tonify

that the growth of yin depends in the last instance on the
generative capacities of yang.

* The second view, represented by Wang Ang in Medical For-
mulas Collected and Analyzed, assumes that the formula
treats deficiency of both the qi and blood and thus needs
two different herbs to deal with these two problems.

¢ A third group of physicians, represented by Wang Fu in
Collectanea of Investigations from the Realm of Medicine,
holds that Astragali Radix (hudng qi) tonifies the Spleen
and Stomach as the postnatal source of blood.

* A fourth position, represented by Zhang Bin-Cheng in Con-
venient Reader of Established Formulas, is that it is used as
an emergency measure to secure floating yang.

* Finally, a fifth group of physicians, represented by Chen
Nian-Zu in Compendium of Songs on Modern Formulas,
argues that the fever treated by this formula is due to unre-
solved heat constrained at the level of the skin and hair. In
the opinion of these physicians, Astragali Radix (hudng qi)
is light and slightly warming so that it can enter this part of
the body from which it clears heat by promoting sweating.

Although all five perspectives are validated by the indications
for which this formula has been used, that of Zhang Bin-
Cheng appears to come closest to the original indications.
As outlined above, Li Dong-Yuan specifically composed this
formula to treat a pattern resembling White Tiger Decoction
(bdi hi tang), from which it is distinguished merely by the
deficient pulse. If White Tiger Decoction (bdi hii tang) treats
patterns where the outward dispersion of yang qi has become
excessive, this implies that the present formula must treat pat-
terns of deficiency characterized by the same pathodynamic.
This justifies the large dosage of Astragali Radix (hudng qi)
and its use as chief herb in the formula. Many commenta-
tors therefore suggest that the dosage of this herb be reduced
considerably if the formula is used to treat blood deficiency
without floating yang or combined qi and blood deficiency.

Comparisons
> Vs. WHITE TIGER Decoction (bdi hii tang)

Both formulas treat feverishness, hot sensations in the mus-
cles, flushing, irritability, restlessness, and other symptoms of
heat through to the exterior. White Tiger Decoction (bdi hi
tang) treats patterns of yang brightness excess, as reflected
in thirst with a desire for cold drinks, profuse sweating, and
a flooding, excessive pulse that is forceful when pressed. By
contrast, Tangkuei Decoction to Tonify the Blood (dang gui
bii xue tang) treats patterns of deficiency where the qi in the
exterior is too weak to contain the yang. This is reflected in
thirst with a desire for warm drinks, sweating aggravated by
exertion, and a large but deficient pulse that appears strong at
the surface but is revealed as weak with pressure.

> Vs. OTHER FORMULAS THAT TREAT HEAT DUE TO
Qi Dericiency

This is one of a number of different formulas that can be
used to treat internal heat due to qi deficiency, where the use
of bitter, cold, heat-draining or sweet, cooling, yin-nourish-
ing herbs and formulas would be contraindicated. Tangkuei
Decoction to Tonify the Blood (dang gui bu xuee tang) treats
patterns characterized by blood deficiency failing to secure
the yang, which then floats to the exterior. Rambling Powder
(xiao ydo sdn) or Six-Gentlemen Decoction (li jin zi tang)
plus Bupleuri Radix (chdi hu) can be used to treat patterns
where the yang qi becomes constrained in the interior. Tonify
the Middle to Augment the Qi Decoction (bu zhong yi qi
tang) treats yang qi constraint due to failure of the clear qi
to ascend. Tonify Spleen-Stomach, Drain Yin Fire, and Raise
Yang Decoction (bii pi wei xie yin hud sheng ydng tang) treats
patterns characterized by relatively severe constraint and fire
exess due to inability of the qi to manage the ascent and de-
scent of fire. Finally, Minor Construct the Middle Decoction
(xido jian zhong tang) treats patterns characterized by nutri-
tive qi deficiency leading to a relative excess of protective qi.

> Vs. TANGKUEI AND SIX- YELLOW DECOCTION
(dang gui lit hudng tang)

Both of these formulas treat flushing and feverishness and
contain the synergistic combination of Astragali Radix
(hudng qi) and Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui). How-
ever, Tangkuei and Six-Yellow Decoction (dang gui lit hudng
tang) focuses on enriching the yin and draining excess fire
while the function of stabilizing the exterior in order to con-
trol sweating is secondary. It is therefore used to treat fever
and night sweats accompanied by a dry mouth and parched
lips, irritability, dry stools, dark and scanty urine, a red, dry
tongue, and a rapid pulse. Tangkuei Decoction to Tonify the
Blood (dang gui bi xue tang), on the other hand, focuses on
tonifying deficient qi in the exterior. For this reason, it uses a
very large dosage of Astragali Radix (hudng qi), but none of
the bitter, cooling, or yin-tonifying herbs used in Tangkuei
and Six-Yellow Decoction (dang gui litt hudng tang).
