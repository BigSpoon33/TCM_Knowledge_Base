196 Chapter 4 / Formulas that Clear Heat

be diagnosed “by examining [how a child] sleeps. There is
warm breath in the [open] mouth and they may sleep face
down with bouts of teeth grinding. All of these indicate Heart
heat.”

There has been considerable debate over whether this pat-
tern denotes heat from excess or deficiency. The proponents
of heat from excess argue that the presence of Akebiae Caulis
(mi: tong) and Lophatheri Herba (dan zhti ye), which leach
out fluids, can also injure the yin. They would not have been
included had the formula been intended for treating heat
from deficiency. On the other side, the proponents of heat
from deficiency argue that the absence of Coptidis Rhizoma
(hudng lidn), which treats heat excess in the Heart channel,
would certainly have been included had the formula been
intended for treating heat from excess.

A close look at the source text reveals that both of these
views are incomplete. Craft of Medicinal Treatment for Child-
hood Disease Patterns contains a description of ‘Heart qi ex-
cess’ (8 4. ¥ xin qi shi) that lists a desire to sleep face up (xt
yang wd 3-4 BA) as one of its signs. This pattern is treated
with Drain the Epigastrium Decoction (xie xin tang), a for-
mula containing Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn) as its chief
herb. Clearly, therefore, the pattern of Heart fire is not simply
one of Heart excess. In another passage, Qian Yi notes that
“Dark red [eyes imply] Heart heat. This is governed by Guide
Out the Red Powder (ddo chi sen). Pale red eyes [imply]
Heart deficiency heat («Ss ff 34 xin xii re). This is governed by
Rehmannia and Rhinoceros Powder (sheng xi san). The lat-
ter formula contains Radix Rehmanniae Glutinosae (sheng di
hudng) but not Akebiae Caulis (mi tong). Clearly, therefore,
Heart heat is not synonymous with heat from deficiency.

It follows that Qian Yi’s disease category “Heart heat’ refers
to a unique pattern that corresponds to an instability that
Golden Mirror of the Medical Tradition defines as “water de-
ficiency with fire that is not excessive” (KE KA € shui xi
hue bit shi). This description attempts to capture a pathology
that reflects the immature development of the qi dynamic in
children. Because the yin and yang are still unstable and un-
grounded, the qi in children readily moves this way and then
that, becoming hot or cold, excessive or deficient, without
either aberration from the norm indicating a substantial un-
derlying excess or deficiency. The present formula responds
by guiding out fire excess without damaging the yin, and by
generating yin fluids without retaining the pathogenic heat.

Usage

Over time, the original indication of this formula was ex-
panded by successive generations of physicians. The 11th-
century Formulary of the Pharmacy Service for Benefiting the
People in the Taiping Era, for instance, lists its indications as
internal heat in the Heart channel in both children and adults
with irritability, a stifling sensation in the chest, and co
