Formulas that Rescue Devastated Yang 279

Commentary

Cold directly attacking the three yin warps is a relatively acute
condition that requires urgent attention. According to Tao
Hua, the author of this formula, it can be distinguished from
cold that has penetrated into the interior via the yang warps
by the complete abscence of fever or headache at the onset of
the disorder. In addition to the obvious middle burner symp-
toms, the pulse is of central importance in identifying this
pattern. If the weak and therefore thin pulse associated with
Frigid Extremities Decoction (si ni tang) indicates that there
is insufficient yang to move the yin, the submerged, slow,
weak, and (at times) imperceptible pulse associated with this
pattern signifies yang deficiency coupled with a deficiency of
nutritive gi. The nutritive qi is produced in the middle burner
and fills the vessels. Without it, the protective yang has noth-
ing with which to attach itself. If it is lost in a situation where
there is also no yang, the pulse becomes imperceptible.

The formula therefore addresses a pattern where both
protective yang and nutritive yin are deficient. In Revised
Popular Guide to the Discussion of Cold Damage, He Xiu-
Shan is cited as calling it “the most beneficial formula for
augmenting the qi and generating the pulse.” In the same text,
He Lian-Chen stipulates that it could also be used for damage
to the original yang caused by using excessively cooling and
draining formulas when treating a warm pathogen disorder.
In Discussion of Medical Formulas, Fei Bo-Xiong explains
how it achieves these effects by comparing it with the purely
heating Frigid Extremities Decoction (si ni tang):

This formula can be used to treat moderate patterns of middle
burner cold. If its [name] refers to ‘meeting urgent needs’ (#&

& jit jf), this indicates the combination of Zingiberis Rhizoma
(gan jiang) and Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fit zi)
with Six-Gentlemen Decoction (litt jiin zi tang) and Schisan-
drae Fructus (wit wei zi). This [combination] moderates any
excessiveness in the nature of Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jidng)
and Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi). This differs
[significantly] from the [manner in which] Frigid Extremities
Decoction (si n} tang) removes one obstacle after another.

Comparisons
> Vs. GENERATE THE PULSE PowDER (sheng mai sdn)

The earliest formula for generating the pulse (9k sheng mai)
when it becomes imperciptible is Sun Si-Miao’s Generate the
Pulse Powder (sheng mai sdn), discussed in Chapter 8. That
formula treats a condition where the pulse disappears due
to concurrent deficiency of gi and body fluids. By contrast,
the present formula contains two of the three herbs used in
Generate the Pulse Powder (sheng mai sdn), namely, Ginseng
Radix (ren shen) and Schisandrae Fructus (wu wei zi). By
combining these two with strongly heating and unblocking
herbs, it creates a new formula that treats an imperceptible
pulse caused by excess cold and deficient nutritive qi.

> Vs. WHITE PENETRATING DECOCTION (bdi tong tang)

White Penetrating Decoction (bdi tong tang) also unblocks
the vessels but treats a pattern characterized by a strong and
tight pulse. Because the fluids are not deficient, this formula
simply uses acrid and heating herbs that scatter cold to re-
move the yin excess

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, acute gastroenter-
itis, food posioning, and hypotension.

4 Actions Restores the yang, strongly tonifies the source qi, and
m rescues the qi from collapse due to devastated yang

Indications

Cold extremities, sweating, weak breathing and shortness
of breath, dizziness, an extremely pale complexion, a pale
tongue, and a faint pulse that is almost imperceptible

This is severe deficiency of the source qi with sudden col-
lapse of the yang qi. The function of the yang qi is to warm
the body and promote the physiological activity of the entire
organism. Its source is the gate of vitality in the lower burner
and its strength is an expression of the prenatal constitution.
As the most yang aspect of the qi dynamic, it must attach
itself to more substantive elements, such as the nutritive qi,
body fluids, or blood, in order to carry out its functions. If
this happens, the interpenetration of yin and yang ensures
the smooth functioning of the qi dynamic. On the other
hand, if the yang qi collapses, all physiological processes be-
gin to break down and the movement of any other type of qi
ceases. In sudden collapse, the processes that are most visibly
affected are at the more yang aspects of the qi dynamic as-
sociated with the Heart and Lungs. If the yang qi is unable
to support the pulse, this manifests as cold extremities and
a faint, almost imperceptible, pulse. If it is unable to stabilize
the superficial levels of the body, this leads to sweating and a
drainage of the yin and fluids. Weak breathing and shortness
of breath, dizziness, pale complexion, and a pale tongue indi-
cate yang deficiency leading to Lung qi deficiency.

Analysis of Formula

To restore the exhausted yang and rescue the qi from col-
lapse, very warm and strongly tonifying herbs must be used.
The chief ingredient, sweet and warm Ginseng Radix (ren
shen), strongly tonifies the source qi within the Heart and
Lungs, augmenting the qi and enriching the fluids.The dep-
uty, Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi), warms and
tonifies the true yang at the gate of vitality. Together with
the main herb, it assists the Spleen earth at the center of all
transformation in the body. In this manner, it unfolds a rapid
supportive action into the entire qi dynamic, even though
it is composed of just two herbs. It is therefore suitable for
conditions of acute collapse of the yang qi.

Cautions and Contraindications

This is a very strong tonic designed for the treatment of acute
conditions. It should not be administered long term. Once the
yang qi has been restored and the acute stage has passed, the
pattern of disharmony should be reevaluated and the formula
modified accordingly. Extended use generates fire, which in-
jures the yin and consumes the blood.

Commentary

When the yang qi suddenly collapses, the functions of
ascending, descending, entering, and leaving come to a halt,
which presents a life-threatening condition. The powerful
tonifying action of this formula makes it suitable for emer-
gencies. Hospitals of traditional medicine in China prepare
the formula as a solution and administer it intravenously.
One way of explaining its rapid life-saving efficacy is
its dual tonification of pre- and postnatal yang and qi. The
Golden Mirror of the Medical Tradition takes this approach:

No [herb] excels at tonifying the postnatal qi like Ginseng
Radix (ren shen). No herb is as good at tonifying the prenatal qi
as Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zh? fu zt). This is [the prin-
ciple] on which Ginseng and Aconite Accessory Root Decoc-
tion (shen fu tang) is established. Mutually accentuating, if used
appropriately, these two herbs are able to transform qi in a flash
as if out of thin air, and to generate yang in an instant within
the gate of vitality. This formula possesses the most spirit-like
agility.

Another explanation is provided by the early modern physi-
cian Tang Zong-Hai in Discussion of Blood Patterns. Tang em-
phasizes the formula’s action on the lower and upper burn-
ers:

A person's original qi originates in the Kidneys and emerges
through the Lungs. If the Lung yin cannot exert its governance
of rhythm, the Kidney yang will be unable to return to its
source, leading to a pattern [characterized by] wheezing and
abandonment. One uses Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi
fui), which enters into the Kidneys, to tonify the root of yang
qi. One uses Ginseng Radix (ren shen), which enters into the
Lungs, to assist the governance of qi emission. The two herbs
mutually assist each other to strongly tonify the yang qi. Qi

is the yang of water and water is the yin of qi. Ginseng Radix
(ren shen) tonifies the yin of qi, while Aconiti Radix lateralis
preparata (zhi ft zi) tonifies the yang of water. If one under-
stands this, one understands everything about the strategy for
tonifying the qi.

not abandoned the organism. Thus, it uses strongly warm-
ing, acrid herbs to disperse the cold and restore the yang.
Ginseng and Aconite Accessory Root Decoction (shen ft
tang), on the other hand, treats patterns characterized by qi
abandonment with symptoms like wheezing, sweating, and
a very faint pulse. Thus, it balances the dispersion of cold
with the tonification of qi and fluids in order to secure the
qi and yang.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders includ-
ing cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock,
postpartum hemorrhage, uterine bleeding, and other causes
of hypovolemic shock.

which is used for chronic deficient yang patterns that have reached
a critical stage, the emphasis of this formula is on strengthening the
exhausted qi associated with acute, severe blood loss.
