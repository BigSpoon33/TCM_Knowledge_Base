Formulas that Tonify the Blood 343

Indications

Amenorrhea of gradual onset from long-term blood defi-
ciency. Attendant symptoms include general disquietude,
gradually worsening afternoon tidal fevers, emaciation, and
achy and uncomfortable flesh and bones of the hands and
feet. The formula also treats irregular menstruation or scanty
menses from deficiency of yin and blood accompanied by
blood stasis.

The source text puts the above symptoms in the context
of “yin deficiency blood weakness [which allows] yang to
roam and overwhelm. Scarce water cannot extinguish the
abundance of fire [leaving] fire to accelerate its drying ef-
fect on water [thus resulting in] devastation of fluids.” The
author goes on to say that the treatment principle in such
circumstances is to “nourish the blood and augment the yin.
One should be cautious not to use toxic herbs to unblock.”
The text also mentions that, despite obvious heat signs, one
should not use cool herbs such as Artemisiae annuae Herba
(qing hao) in this situation because to do so would cause the
blood to congeal, which would aggravate the disorder.

Analysis of Formula

The formula contains mild and moderate herbs to gently
nourish and move the blood and nourish the Heart. The chief
herb, Platycladi Semen (bai zi ren), is a good example of the
gentle and nourishing nature of this formula. Comprehensive
Outline of the Materia Medica states that this herb:

Nourishes Heart qi, moistens Kidney dryness, quiets the ethe-
real soul, and settles the corporeal soul. Its nature is balanced,
and it is neither cold nor drying. Its flavor is sweet and tonify-
ing, it is acrid and yet can moisten, its qi is clear and fragrant,
and it can penetrate the Heart and Kidney and augment the
Spleen and Stomach.

Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di hudng), the deputy
herb, enriches the Kidney yin and nourishes the blood, thus
addressing the two main causes of the disorder. Achyranthis
bidentatae Radix (niti xi) nourishes the Liver and Kidney,
invigorates the blood, dispels stasis, and guides the blood
downward. Dipsaci Radix (xi dudn) tonifies the Liver but
can also break up blood stasis. Because the author of this
formula wanted to avoid strong moving herbs for this pat-
tern, the movement of the blood is promoted with herbs that
tonify or nourish as they promote movement.

Lycopi Herba (ze dn) is a blood-moving agent that is ac-
rid, bitter, fragrant, and drying. It is often contraindicated in
cases of blood deficiency. In this formula, however, its drying
nature is offset by the inclusion of a large dosage of Rehman-
niae Radix preparata (shu di hudng). The acrid, dispersing,
and fragrant Spleen-arousing nature of Lycopi Herba (ze len)
also helps to obviate the stagnation that Rehmanniae Radix
preparata (shi di hudng) might otherwise engender. Lycopi
Herba (ze [en) unblocks the menses, invigorates the blood,

and dispels stasis. It joins with the more moderate Achyran-
this bidentatae Radix (niti xi) and Dipsaci Radix (xis duan) to
move the blood and dispel stasis.

The last of the four assistants is Selaginellae tamariscinae
Herba (#44 judn bdi), which has the English name of tama-
riskoid spikemoss. It is acrid and neutral, enters the Liver and
Heart channels, and stops bleeding when charred, but other-
wise invigorates the blood and unblocks the channels.

Commentary

In the early 20th-century gynecology text Compendium of
Secrets for Women’s Diseases, Chen Lian-Fang cites Arborvi-
tae Seed Pill for Women’s Disorders (nii ke bdi zi ren wan) as
one of the four formulas for the treatment of withered-blood
amenorrhea (2 4448 Pl xue kit jing bi), which is one of the
two main categories of amenorrhea, the other being blood
obstruction (.t2 hi xue ge). The two can be distinguished by
studying the history of the disorder and its attendant symp-
toms. In the same text, Zhang Jing-Yue notes:

Liver disease withered-blood pattern and blood-obstruction
pattern are similar, both displaying the symptom of amenor-
rhea. [However, in truth,] they are as different as ice and hot
coals. Withering [signals] exhaustion, blood deficiency in the
extreme. Obstruction [signals] blockage; the blood’s founda-
tion is not deficient [and there is evidence of] rebellion [from]
qi [stagnation], cold, or accumulation.

The onset may be gradual in both patterns, but the pres-
ence of pain or other symptoms of rebellion and excess in
the blood-obstruction type, and the attendant symptoms of
blood and yin deficiency in the blood-withering type, are im-
portant markers for differentiation. Chen Lian-Fang suggests
Arborvitae Seed Pill for Women’s Disorders (nii ke bdi zi ren
wdn) for withered-blood amenorrhea in patients who exhibit
blood deficiency with fire from yin deficiency. The thinking
here matches that of the formula’s author, Chen Zi-Ming, who
stated that the formula is for women who are “gradually los-
ing weight, have irritating pain in the flesh and bones of the
hands and feet, gradually worsening tidal fevers, and a faint
and rapid pulse.”

Although it treats patients with signs of deficiency fire,
Arborvitae Seed Pill for Women’s Disorders (ni ke bdi zi ren
wdn) is a warm and nourishing formula. Its author warned
against the use of cold herbs that would aggravate the stag-
nation and damage the yin and qi. Instead, he advised that
withered-blood amenorrhea required the use of nourishing
and gently moving agents, as the signs of heat will fall away
naturally as their root cause is eradicated.

Comparison
> Vs. Four-SuBsTaNnce DEcOcTION (si wit tang)

Both of these formulas treat menstrual irregularities owing to
blood deficiency and blood stasis. The difference lies in their


344 Chapter 8 / Formulas that Tonify

focus. While Four-Substance Decoction (si wi tang) is better
suited for blood deficiency, it is less able than Arborvitae Seed
Pill for Women’s Disorders (nit ke bdi zi ren wdn) to move the
blood and dispel stasis, nor can it treat the disturbance of the
spirit that is part of the pattern that Arborvitae Seed Pill for
Women’s Disorders (nil ke bdi zi ren wdn) treats. For cases
where blood deficiency is paramount and stasis secondary,
the two formulas can be used together.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders including
amenorrhea and irregular menstruation.

Modifications

* For severe blood stasis, manifestIng in stabbing pain in the
lower abdomen, purple tongue color, and clotted menstrual
blood, add Verbenae Herba (md bian cdo), Persicae Semen
(tdo ren), Carthami Flos (hdeng hua), and Spatholobi Caulis
(ji xue teng).

¢ If the patient suffers from Spleen-deficient digestive diffi-
culties, replace Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shti di hudng)
with Two-Solstice Pill (er zhi wan).

* For blood-deficient headaches, add Angelicae sinensis Ra-
dix (dang gui) and Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chuan xidng).

¢ For insomnia, add Albiziae Cortex (he hudn pi) and
Spatholobi Caulis (ji xue teng).

* For amenorrhea due to a meager amount of blood, add
Lycopi Herba (ze ldn), Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gut),
Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo), and Paeoniae Radix alba
(bdi shdo). In Golden Mirror of the Medical Tradition, the
combination of these four herbs is called Lycopus Decoc-
tion (ze dn tang).

© Actions Nourishes the blood, augments the yin, moderates
' painful spasms, and alleviates pain
Indications

Irritability, slight chills, spasms of the calf muscles, and the
absence of coating on the tongue. The formula also treats

cramps in the hands, and abdominal pain that improves with
pressure.

This formula was originally used for the first pattern de-
scribed here, which was said to occur when the inappropriate
use of sweating had injured the blood or yin. At present, it is
used for any type of pain in the calves with blood deficiency
or injury to the fluids. The irritability and lack of tongue
coating are attributed to injury to the yin. The slight chills
are due to weakness of the yang that follows injury to the
yin, and may not always be present. The spasms, cramps, and
abdominal pain are typically spasmodic, wind-like manifes-
tations that are commonly associated with patterns of Liver
blood deficiency or exuberant wood (Liver) overwhelming
earth (Spleen). The fact that the pain improves with pressure
indicates that it is neither due to heat (i.e., inflammatory in
nature) nor to an organic lesion.

Analysis of Formula

The chief herb is Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi shdo), which nour-
ishes the blood and preserves the yin. It enters the Spleen,
softens the Liver, and alleviates pain. It thereby addresses the
primary aspects of this condition. The Liver is a hard, ‘edgy’
organ, and its qi has a tendency to rebel transversely. This
herb is effective in moderating the wayward inclinations of
the Liver qi, especially when it overacts on earth, and pre-
serving the Liver yin; this is what is meant by ‘softening of the
Liver? Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata (zhi gan cdo) augments
the qi of the middle burner, especially that of the Spleen, and
moderates urgency. Together, these herbs regulate the rela-
tionship between the Liver and Spleen and nourish the sin-
ews and blood, which in turn stops the spasms and pain.

Commentary

This formula is very popular for treating a wide variety of
pain syndromes associated with spasms and cramps. In
Treatment Strategies and Formulas in Chinese Medicine, the
contemporary physician Chen Chao-Zu identifies the follow-
ing markers for use of this formula:

¢ Hypertonicity of the extremities characterized by difficult
extension and flexion

* Pain in the head, body, or limbs due to arterial spasms,
characterized by severe pulling pain

e Abdominal pain characterized by tightness and distention
that responds favorably to pressure

* Hypertonicity of smooth muscle leading to symptoms such
as wheezing, coughing, hiccup, vomiting, or diarrhea char-
acterized by subjective sensations of severe discomfort.

The formula is also used to overcome aconite toxicity.
The strategy by which this formula addresses these prob-
lems is widely known as ‘transforming yin with sweet and


Formulas that Tonify the Blood 345

sour [herbs]? There are two very different interpretations of
this adage in the literature. The first interprets ‘transforming’
to mean ‘forming’ and focuses on the yin-nourishing qualities
of the formula. The second reads ‘transforming yin’ as imply-
ing a more dynamic action of opening obstruction by means
of regulating the qi. Fei Bo-Xiong’s analysis of the formula in
Discussion of Medical Formulas is representative of the latter
view:

If there is no free flow, there will be pain. When the abdomen
and middle [burner] are not harmonized, the qi rebels and
there is turbid yin, In this case, one employs the method of
transforming yin with sweet and sour herbs in order to natu-
rally diminish rebellious qi, This is also the wisdom [implied in
the notion of] softening [excessive] restraint.

An interpretation that reconciles the two views was offered
by Chen Chao-Zu. Chen pointed out that the source text
uses equal amounts of Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo) and
Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi shdo), implying that both sweet
and sour flavors are equally important constituents of the
formula. This accords with Chapter 22 of Basic Questions,
which admonishes: “When the Liver suffers from tension,
urgently take sweet [medicinals] in order to moderate it.”
The yin-nourishing action of sweet herbs, in other words,
is a primary tool for moderating hypertonicity throughout
the body, and sweet herbs like Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo),
Jujubae Fructus (da zdo), and Maltosum (yi tdng) are con-
sistently used in classical formulas for this purpose. Rather
than merely harmonizing the middle burner or the actions
of the other herbs, sweet flavors thus actively control the
yang. Softening and moderating in nature, they relax ten-
sion, restore free flow, and thereby alleviate pain.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a very wide variety of biomedically-defined disorders.
These can be divided into the following groups:

¢ Pain and discomfort from spasms of skeletal muscles, liga-
ments, and related tissues including fibromyalgia, cramp-
ing calf muscles, vaginismus, priaprism, laryngeal spasm,
poststroke contractures, periarthritis of the shoulder, acute
lumbar strain, and spinal osteophytes

« Pain, often severe, from smooth muscle spasm such as bili-
ary colic, renal colic, gastric spasm, intestinal adhesions,
peptic ulcers, atrophic gastritis, bronchial asthma, pertus-
sis, ulcerative colitis, end-stage hepatic carcinoma, and
threatened miscarriage

* Bone and joint pain such as rheumatoid arthritis, heel pain,
cervical spine syndrome, necrosis of the femoral head, and
disc disease

« Neuralgia, including trigeminal neuralgia, intercostal neu-
ralgia, postherpetic neuralgia, sciatica, and diabetic neu-
ropathy

* Disorders marked by involuntary stimulation such as re-
calcitrant hiccups, restless leg syndrome, bruxism, facial
tics, Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, atrial fibrillation,
night terrors, and enuresis

¢ Bleeding disorders such as thrombocytopenic purpura, al-
lergic purpura, upper GI bleeding, bronchiectasis, and re-
current nosebleeds

* Problems due to decreases in humoral functionality such
as male and female infertility, hypotestosteronemia, im-
potence from increased prolactin levels, and myasthenia
gravis.

In addition, this formula has also been used for treating hep-
atitis, diabetes, acute mastitis, bacillary dysentery, habitual
constipation, anal fissures, and coronary artery disease.

Modifications

* For fixed pain that increases with pressure, substitute Pae-
oniae Radix rubra (chi shdo) for Paeoniae Radix alba (bdi
shdo).

* For a slow pulse and other signs of cold, add Zingiberis
Rhizoma (gan jiang).

¢ For a flooding pulse and other signs of heat, add Coptidis
Rhizoma (hudng lidn).

* To increase the efficacy of the formula in treating spasms of
the calf muscles, add Achyranthis Radix (nit x7) and Chae-
nomelis Fructus (mit gud).

* For abdominal pain, add Cyperi Rhizoma (xiang fu).
* For wind rash, add Cicadae Periostracum (chdn tu)), Ju-
jubae Fructus (da zdo), and Kochiae Fructus (di fa zi).

* For spasms of the extremities and stiff neck and back as-
sociated with encephalitis, after the fever has broken, add
Scorpio (qudn xie) and Scolopendra (wii gong).

@ Actions Warms the interior, nourishes the blood, and alleviates
pain

Indications

Postpartum abdominal pain, cold abdominal hernial pain, or
spasmodic pain in the flanks. The pain responds favorably
to pressure and warmth. The pulse is submerged, wiry, and
forceless.

This is a pattern of interior deficiency with cold blood. In
the postpartum period, the blood is often deficient because
of loss of blood and essence during birth. If an external cold
pathogenic influence takes advantage of this weakened con-
dition and invades the body, it will lodge in the blood level
and obstruct the dynamic of both qi and blood. Because defi-
ciency is the primary etiology, the pain will respond favorably
to pressure, and because it is a cold disorder, it will respond
favorably to warmth. The pulse is submerged and wiry be-
cause of the pain from interior cold, and forceless because of
the deficiency. This type of cold abdominal hernial pain and
spasmodic flank pain may also occur in individuals with con-
stitutional blood deficiency.

Analysis of Formula

The chief ingredient is mutton (ydng rdu). Heating, sweet, and
acrid in nature, mutton strongly tonifies the fire at the gate of
vitality, nourishes the blood, and augments the qi. Angeli-
cae sinensis Radix (dang gui), which tonifies without causing
stagnation, and warms without drying, serves as deputy. It is
also an excellent herb for generating blood, which is required
in this condition. Acrid, warm Zingiberis Rhizoma recens
(sheng jiang) scatters the cold and serves as the assistant in-
gredient. It also facilitates digestion of the chief ingredient
and thereby indirectly aids in tonification. Because it warms,
it also assists the deputy in moving the blood. The combina-
tion of these three ingredients not only nourishes the blood,
but also disperses the cold and thereby relieves the pain.

Commentary

This formula is an example of ‘food as medicine’ It embod-
ies the principle of ‘unblocking [through] tonification’ (38 #4

tong bit), taken up by later physicians, with the use of such
herbs as Cistanches Herba (rou ceng reng) or Morindae of-
ficinalis Radix (ba ji tidn). By this is meant the use of herbs
with a thick flavor capable of tonifying the blood and essence,
yet which are also warming and moving in nature so that
they can unblock the pain from deficiency. It is important to
note that when the formula is used in treating hernial pain, it
should be taken after the acute stage has resolved. It will not
help in acute conditions. Its use has been expanded to include
dysmenorrhea, leukorrhea, lower back pain, and abdominal
pain associated with cold from deficiency.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders such as
postpartum weakness, hernia, leukorrhea, male infertility,
and thrombocytopenic purpura.

Modifications
* For severe cold, increase the dosage of Zingiberis Rhizoma
recens (sheng jidng) to 48 grams. (source text)

* For severe pain and vomiting, add 6g of Citri reticulatae
Pericarpium (chen pf) and 3g of Atractylodis macrocepha-
lae Rhizoma (bdi zhti), (source text)

¢ For severe pain, add a large amount (over 30g) of Paeoniae
Radix alba (bdi shdo).

* For profuse, continuous sweating postpartum, add Astrag-
ali Radix (hudng qi).
« For lochioschesis, add Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui zhi).

| Actions Tonifies and augments the qi and blood

Indications

Pallid or sallow complexion, palpitations with anxiety that
may be continuous, reduced appetite, shortness of breath,
laconic speech, extremities that are easily fatigued, lighthead-
edness and/or vertigo, a pale tongue with a white coating,
and a pulse which is either thin and frail or large, deficient,
and without strength.

This is concurrent deficiency of the gi and blood, most
often due to imbalances caused by chronic disease or exces-
sive loss of blood. The Lungs control the body’s gi; when the
qi is deficient, the Lung qi will also be deficient. This mani-
fests as shortness of breath and laconic speech. A poor ap-
petite is almost a pathognomonic sign of Spleen qi deficiency.
In this case, the Spleen qi is too weak to transform and trans-
port nutrients to the extremities. When this is combined with
blood deficiency, the extremities are easily fatigued. Concur-
rent deficiency of the qi and blood also prevents nourishment
(the clear yang and the blood) from reaching the head and
Heart. This leads to palpitations (which may be continuous),
lightheadedness and/or vertigo, and a pallid or sallow com-
plexion. The complexion will be more pallid if the condition
is primarily one of qi deficiency, and more sallow if blood
deficiency predominates. The pale tongue with a white coat-
ing combines signs of blood and qi deficiency. If blood defi-
ciency predominates, the pulse will be thin and frail, and if qi
deficiency predominates, the pulse will be large, deficient, and
without strength.

Analysis of Formula

To treat patterns caused by both qi and blood deficiency, this
formula pays equal attention to both. All the chief herbs are
warming in nature. Ginseng Radix (ren shen) augments the
qi, and Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di hudng) nour-
ishes the blood. Two of the deputies, Atractylodis macro-
cephalae Rhizoma (bdi zhti) and Poria (fu ling), strengthen
the Spleen and dry or leach-out dampness, thereby assist-
ing Ginseng Radix (ren shen) in strengthening the qi of the
Spleen and Lungs. The other deputies, Paeoniae Radix alba
(bdi shdo) and Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui), nourish
the blood and thereby reinforce the action of Rehmanniae
Radix preparata (shi di hudng).

One of the assistants, Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chuan
xiong), invigorates the blood and promotes the movement
of qi. The other, Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata (zhi gan cdo),
augments the qi and harmonizes the middle burner. The en-
voys are Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jidng) and Jujubae
Fructus (da zdo), which regulate the absorptive function of
the Stomach and Spleen. This is especially important because
it allows the other herbs in the formula to be absorbed. The
envoys also regulate the relationship between the protective
and nutritive qi, which allows a patient suffering from defi-
ciency to recover without developing other problems.

Commentary

This formula is a combination of Four-Gentlemen Decoction
(si jain zi tang) and Four-Substance Decoction (si wit tang).
The reader is referred to those formulas for a more complete
discussion of the interaction among the ingredients. Because
one of these formulas tonifies the qi and the other one the
blood, most commentators interpret the combined formulas
as simply additive. The one exception is the modern physician
Zhang Shan-Lei, who views the formula as acting primarily
on the middle burner, as discussed in this passage from An-
notated and Corrected Synopsis of Shen’s Women’s Disorders:

Based on the physiological function of the ingredients, one can
say that Four-Gentlemen Decoction (si jiin zi tang) [consists of]
qi herbs, which are able to support the Spleen yang. Four-Sub-
stance Decoction (si wi tang) [consists of] blood herbs, which
are able to nourish the Spleen yin. The former relates to qi, the
latter to blood. Hence, one can explain [this formula] as focus-
ing on the Spleen and Stomach, and one need not just general-
ize about Four-Gentlemen Decoction (si jtin zi tang) tonifying
qi and Four-Substance Decoction (si wi: tang) tonifying blood.

If one examines the original indications of the formula, there
is some justification for Zhang’s focus on the middle burner.
These are listed in the source texts as abdominal pain, com-
plete disinterest in food, frailty of the yin and yang organs,
diarrhea, hardness and pain in the lower abdomen, and pe-
riodic chills and fevers. Furthermore, although originally a
women’s formula, it has long been used to treat any pattern
in both men and women where both the qi and blood are de-
ficient. The presentation may include chills and fever, weight
loss, abscesses that neither suppurate nor improve, and con-
tinuous spotting from uterine bleeding.
