## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
Master formula for the modern "stressed woman" - combines liver qi stagnation (emotional stress) with spleen qi deficiency (digestive weakness) and blood deficiency (fatigue). Represents the classic approach to psychosomatic disorders in TCM.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows anti-depressant effects, hormone-regulating properties, and digestive benefits. Chai Hu contains saikosides that affect neurotransmitters. Dang Gui provides hormone-modulating compounds. The combination shows synergistic effects on mood and digestion.

### Clinical Experience
Extremely effective for women with stress-related symptoms affecting mood, digestion, and menstruation. Often takes 4-6 weeks to see full effects. Best results when combined with stress management and lifestyle changes.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, can be taken as pills for long-term use
**Timing**: Between meals, preferably morning and evening
**Duration**: 3-6 months for chronic conditions, 2-3 cycles for menstrual issues
