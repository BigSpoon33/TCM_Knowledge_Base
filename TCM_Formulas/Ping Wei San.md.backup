### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows gastroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and digestive-enhancing effects. Cang Zhu contains compounds that improve gastric motility. Hou Po provides magnolol with anti-ulcer properties. Studies show benefits in functional dyspepsia.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for "thick, heavy" digestive symptoms. Particularly effective for people who feel worse in humid weather or after eating heavy meals. Often combined with other formulas for comprehensive treatment.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, can be taken as powder
**Timing**: Before meals to improve digestive function
**Duration**: 2-8 weeks for chronic digestive dampness
