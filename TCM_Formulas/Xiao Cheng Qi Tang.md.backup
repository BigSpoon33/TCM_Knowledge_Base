## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
"Xiao Cheng Qi" means "minor coordination of qi" - a gentler version of Da Cheng Qi Tang that focuses on moving qi and relieving mild to moderate constipation. Without Mang Xiao, it's less drastically purging but still effective for yangming bowel patterns. Perfect balance for constipation with qi stagnation but without severe heat accumulation.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows laxative, anti-inflammatory, and prokinetic effects. Da Huang contains anthraquinones with strong laxative action. Hou Po and Zhi Shi contain compounds that promote gastric motility and reduce inflammation. Studies demonstrate benefits in functional constipation, post-operative ileus, and bowel preparation.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for moderate constipation with bloating and discomfort. Particularly effective for people who need bowel stimulation but can't tolerate harsh laxatives. Usually works within 6-12 hours. Best results when combined with dietary modifications and adequate hydration. Modern use often for short-term constipation relief.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses, take warm once or twice daily as needed
**Preparation**: Da Huang added last 5-10 minutes of cooking to preserve active compounds
**Timing**: Usually taken in evening for morning bowel movement
**Duration**: Short-term use, 3-5 days maximum without medical supervision
