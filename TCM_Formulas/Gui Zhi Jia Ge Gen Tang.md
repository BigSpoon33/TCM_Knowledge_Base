Formulas that Release Exterior Wind-Cold 31

to the treatment of wind-cold-damp painful obstruction.

Headache, fever, chills, and the absence of sweating are
all due to exterior wind. Focal distention and a stifling op-
pression in the chest reflect qi stagnation and damp obstruc-
tion. The qi and fluids both rely on the free flow in the Triple
Burner to properly ascend and descend. The ability of the
protective qi to move in the Triple Burner is dependent on
the Lung’s ability to clarify and descend, the Liver’s capacity
to dredge and drain, and the Spleen-Stomach’s functions of
raising, ascending, and transporting. In patients who already
suffer from a tendency toward qi stagnation, an externally-
contracted pathogen immediately hinders the Lung’s ability
to disseminate, the Spleen’s ability to transport, and the Liv-
er’s ability to dredge. The resulting stagnation of qi hinders
the flow of fluids, and the obstruction of qi and fluids further
adds to the stagnation. The result is a situation where one
suffers simultaneously from externally-contracted wind-cold
and internal qi stagnation. Stifling oppression in the chest
and focal distention are signs of the stagnant obstruction of
qi and fluids. The tongue coating being thin and white, rather
than greasy, shows that the root cause is primarily qi stagna-
tion and not dampness.

Analysis of Formula

This is another formula built on the basis of Cyperus and
Perilla Leaf Powder (xiang sit sdn), which aims at simultane-
ously dispersing wind-cold from the exterior while opening
stagnant qi in the interior. The chief ingredient, Perillae Fo-
lium (zi sit ye), is acrid and warm. It opens obstructed Lung
qi, disseminates qi in the body’s exterior, and warms and dis-
perses the cold pathogen that fetters the exterior. By dispers-
ing the cold pathogen and opening the interstices, Perillae
Folium (zi sii ye) frees the Lung qi, fluids, and protective qi
to discharge naturally to the body’s exterior and thus relieves
the symptoms of exterior patterns such as chills and fever
and the absence of sweating. In addition, Perillae Folium (zi
si ye) arouses the Spleen and transforms dampness, thus
helping to eliminate focal distention and the stifling oppres-
sion in the chest. One deputy, Citri reticulatae Pericarpium
(chen pi), assists Perillae Folium (zi sii ye) in moving the qi
and transforming dampness. Another deputy, Cyperi Rhi-
zoma (xiang fi), supported by Citri reticulatae Pericarpium
(chen pi), regulates the qi and dredges the Liver, allowing it
to return to its preferred state of orderly reaching. Perillae
Folium (zi sii ye), Citri reticulatae Pericarpium (chen pi), and
Cyperi Rhizoma (xidng fu) as a group promote the free flow
of qi through the three burners.

The last two deputies, Ephedrae Herba (md hudng) and
Puerariae Radix (ge gen), work with Perillae Folium (zi sa ye)
to release pathogens from the body’s exterior. One assistant,
Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng md), works with Puerariae Ra-
dix (ge gen} to ascend and disperse; they release the muscle

layer. The deputies, Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chudn xidng),
which moves the qi within the blood, and Angelicae dahuri-
cae Radix (bdi zhi), work together with the ascending herbs,
Puerariae Radix (ge gen) and Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng
md), to treat wind-cold headache and nasal congestion. The
final deputy, Paeoniae Radix rubra (chi shdo), adjusts and
connects yin and yang, allowing the heat from internal stasis
to move to the exterior where it is released. This herb and Ch-
uanxiong Rhizoma (chudn xieng) also move the blood.

The remaining ingredients are envoys. Acrid and warm
Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jiang) helps Ephedrae
Herba (md hudng) and Perillae Folium (zi sii ye) dispel the
wind-cold pathogen from the exterior. Glycyrrhizae Radix
preparata (zhi gan cdo) tonifies and harmonizes the middle
and also harmonizes the various groups of ingredients. With
the exception of this herb, every ingredient fills one or more
of three roles: releasing wind-cold from the exterior; regulat-
ing the qi in the upper, middle, or lower burner; and relieving
specific symptoms such as headache or nasal congestion.

Commentary

Formulary of the Pharmacy Service for Benefiting the People
in the Taiping Era groups Ten-Miracle Decoction (shi shen
tang) with others that treat damage from cold. It is specifi-
cally listed to “treat unseasonable weather that brings on
fast spreading epidemics which affect many people. [It treats
these] without [the need of] inquiring into [whether] the af-
fliction [belongs to] yin or yang. Also, it can treat wind-cold-
damp painful obstruction.” The text goes on to say that the
formula is safe for the treatment of cold damage in pregnant
women as well as the old and young, irrespective of whether
the disorder is internal or external.

Since this formula has been on record since the Song dy-
nasty, there has been ample time for practitioners to develop
other uses for it and to refine the uses set forth in the source
text. The most common use for the formula is in the treatment
of wind-cold patterns that occur in the presence of internal qi
stagnation. Golden Mirror of the Medical Tradition suggests
this use when it notes that the formula can “discharge external
cold and soothe internal gi constraint to treat a condition
termed cold qi disease. [It] has the ability to warm the chan-
nels and enable the free flow of qi.”

The Ming-dynasty text Achieving Longevity by Guarding
the Seurce, and others, list Ten-Miracle Decaction (shi shen
tang) for epidemic pox disorders, to express papules. Puer-
ariae Radix (ge gen) and Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng md) are
used for this purpose, as in Cimicifuga and Kudzu Decoction
(sheng md ge gen tang). The formula is also mentioned in sev-
eral texts for the treatment of febrile epidemic disorders, such
as massive head febrile disorder.

The source text’s advice that the formula is safe for chil-
dren and pregnant women prompted its recommendation


32 Chapter 1 / Formulas that Release the Exterior

in Posthumous Manuscript from [Bian Que in] Handan for
treating serious wind-cold disorders during pregnancy, and
in Guide to Pediatrics for pediatric fevers due to wind-cold
with body aches, headache, chills, and the absence of sweat-
ing.

Although references to Ten-Miracle Decoction (shi shen
tang) fill the classical literature, its use seems to have lost
popularity in modern China. This is reflected in its omission
from modern teaching textbooks in the Peoples Republic.
This loss of esteem may be related to the sentiments expressed
by the Ming-dynasty physician Wu Shou, who urged caution
when using this formula because he felt that its yang bright-
ness herbs, Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng md) and Puerariae
Radix (ge gen), when used to treat greater yang disorders,
would lead wind-cold pathogens deeper, into the yang bright-
ness. However, the formula is still frequently used in Taiwan
and Japan for initial-stage wind-cold patterns. Interestingly,
a key use of Ten-Miracle Decoction (shi shen tang) in those
places as well as in the Peoples Republic is as a preventative to
epidemic disorders. The formula’s ability to promote the free
flow of qi in the interior and exterior of the body is viewed
as an effective way to enhance the body’s protective qi and
ward off illness. For this purpose, sources generally suggest a
smaller dose of 3-6g per day of the decocted powder.

Comparison

> Vs. AUGMENTED CYPERUS AND PERILLA LEAF POWDER
(jid wei xiang sit san)

Both formulas regulate the qi and release pathogens from the

exterior. However, because Augmented Cyperus and Perilla

Leaf Powder (jia wei xiding sti san) does both of these things
in a milder fashion, it is appropriate for less severe patterns.

Actions Discharges and disperses wind-cold, disseminates and
directs the Lung qi downward, transforms phlegm, stops cough,
| and calms wheezing

Indications

Wind-cold exterior patterns with chills, fever, cough with co-
pious sputum, nasal congestion, deep and low voice, headache,
clouded vision, fullness and oppression in the chest and dia-
phragm, a puffy tongue with tooth marks and a greasy, white
coating, and a floating pulse. It is also specifically indicated for
toothache with a swollen tongue due to wind-cold invasion.

Wind-cold exterior patterns present with chills because
the protective level is compromised. Fever results from the
struggle between the normal qi and the pathogen. The dis-
ruption to the flow of Lung qi that results from the fettering
of the Lungs by wind-cold gives rise to a deep and low voice,
as well as fullness and oppression in the chest and diaphragm.
The nose is the opening of the Lung and thus becomes con-
gested as the Lung qi is fettered. Headache and clouded vision
result from the obstruction in the Lung that blocks the flow of
clear qi to the upper body.


Formulas that Release Exterior Wind-Cald 33

Analysis of Formula

The indications for this formula are the result of an external
pathogen invading and fettering the Lung and causing it to
lose its ability to clarify and direct qi downward. This is com-
plicated by the presence of phlegm, which itself accumulates
because the fettered Lung fails to disseminate the fluids and
send them downward. To address this complicated pattern,
the formula utilizes a strategy of discharging wind-cold from
the exterior while simultaneously unblocking the Lung col-
laterals that are obstructed by phlegm and thin mucus.

The formula’s chief herbs, Inulae Flos (xudn fu hua)
and Ephedrae Herba (md hudng), help the Lung qi to flow
smoothly and in a downward. direction, thus relieving the
cough and wheezing. These two herbs disperse the wind-cold
pathogenic qi and phlegm and direct the qi downward, there-
by treating the external wind-cold and internal collection of
phlegm. Schizonepetae Herba (jing jie) aids the chief herbs
in releasing the wind-cold pathogen from the exterior; it is
the deputy herb. Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhi ban xia)
transforms phlegm, dries dampness, directs the qi downward,
and relieves the cough, while Peucedani Radix (qidn hui) dis-
seminates the Lung qi, eliminates phlegm, relieves the cough,
and directs the qi downward. Paeoniae Radix rubra (chi shdo)
cools the blood and clears heat; coupled with Jujubae Fructus
(da zdo), it nourishes and cools the yin and nutritive level and
thereby prevents them from being damaged by the formula’s
acrid and warm herbs, as well as the yang wind pathogen. It
also resolves the pathogenic heat in the channels and collater-
als that results from wind-cold stagnation. These are the three
assistant herbs. Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo) harmonizes the
middle, augments the qi, and harmonizes the various actions
of the herbs in the formula. As is often the case, Zingiberis
Rhizoma recens (sheng jidng) and Jujubae Fructus (da zdo)
are intended to harmonize the nutritive and protective levels.
In addition, Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jiang) helps
Ephedrae Herba (md hudng) and Schizonepetae Herba (jing
jie) release the wind-cold pathogen from the exterior. These
last three herbs serve as envoys.

Commentary

This formula is named Inula Powder (jin fei cdo san) because
originally, Inulae Herba (jin fei cio) was used as the lead in-
gredient. Nowadays, however, Inulae Flos (xudn fu hud), the
flower portion of the same plant, is used because it is consid-
ered to have a stronger action. We have placed the formula in
this section of the book because it is commonly used to treat
the early stages of externally-contracted wind-cold leading
to a productive cough. Other texts place it in the category of
dispelling phlegm. This implies that it can be used in both the
acute stages of a wind-cold invasion as well as later, when the
acute symptoms have abated and cough becomes the main
symptom.

Paeoniae Radix rubra (chi sheo)

One of the interesting aspects of this formula is its use of Pae-
oniae Radix rubra (chi shdo). There are no obvious signs of
blood stasis or heat, which delimit the modern parameters of
its usage. An answer is provided by the Qing-dynasty physi-
cian Wang Fu, in Collectanea of Investigations from the Realm
of Medicine: “Paeoniae Radix rubra (chi shdo) is a sour herb
used in draining the Liver and astringing yin. In the present
context [it checks] excessive dispersing by Ephedrae Herba
(md hudng). The red [variety of the herb] is used here be-
cause it moves the water aspect and absorbs phlegm-damp-
ness.” This explanation can be extended to the use of Radix
Paeoniae (shdo yao) in many formulas that drain dampness
and regulate the fluids, such as True Warrior Decoction (zhen
wut tang), discussed in Chapter 16; and it helps us understand
the synergism between Poria (fu ling) and Radix Paeoniae
(shdo yao) in formulas such as Cinnamon Twig and Poria Pill
(gui zhi fu ling wan), discussed in Chapter 13. It may even
shed new light on the use of Radix Paeoniae (shdo yao) in
Cinnamon Twig Decoction (gui zhi tang), discussed above.

Composition

Wang Fei also provides a useful analysis of the formula’s
composition as a whole, and specifically its use of Inulae Flos
(xudn fit hud) as chief herb. He argues that the light herbs
in the formula, all of which are used in relatively high doses,
help to focus the action of the formula on the upper burner.
The heavier, downward-draining herbs, such as Pinelliae Rhi-
zoma (ban xia) and Paeoniae Radix rubra (chi shdo), howev-
ef, are necessary to guide excessive fluids to the lower burner
for elimination. This combined action is embodied in the
chief herb Inulae Flos (xudn fu hud). Although it is light and
floating, it is also bitter and thus able to direct downward. Its
salty nature, furthermore, prevents its acridity from damag-
ing the physiological fluids, making it an important herb for
dislodging accumulations from the collaterals. This usage is
discussed in more detail under Inula Decoction (xudn fu hud
tang) in Chapter 13.

Comparisons
> Vs. EpHepra Decocrion (md hudng tang)

Ephedra Decoction (md hudng tang) is better at dispelling
wind-cold, while Inula Powder (jin fei cdo sdn) treats a wider
range of symptoms and is better able to deal with coughs
with copious sputum.

> Vs. Stop CouGHine Powper (zhi sou sdn)

Both formulas treat wind-cold cough with phlegm. However,
Stop Coughing Powder (zhi sou sdn) mostly contains herbs
that aim to regulate the qi, eliminate phlegm, and relieve
cough; it has little ability to release pathogens from the exte-
