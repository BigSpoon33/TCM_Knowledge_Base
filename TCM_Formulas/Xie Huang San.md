Formulas that Drive Out Excess Water 95

clarifying, passage through the bowels is unimpeded. Bitter
and cooling Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) directs the qi
downward and flushes accumulations from the Stomach and
Intestines.

The four main herbs in the formula all direct qi down-
ward to drive out water. To protect the Stomach qi, honey is
added as a fifth substance in the preparation of the pills. Its
sweet flavor moderates harshness, even as its moistening na-
ture assists bowel movement.

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula is contraindicated in cases where the accumula-
tion of fluids in the interior of the body is accompanied by
Spleen deficiency. Like all purging formulas, it should only be
used short term.

Commentary

The main characteristic of this formula is its strategy of elim-
inating different portions of pathogenic fluids via the urine
and bowels, as explained by Cheng Lin in True Explanation
of the Essentials of the Golden Cabinet:

This is water qi in the Small Intestine. Stephaniae tetrandrae
Radix (han fang ji) and Zanthoxyli Semen (jido mit) guide

out fluids at the front because [their] clear [portion] must be
cleared via the urine. Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) and
Lepidii/Descurainiae Semen (ting li zi) push out fluids at the
rear, because [their] turbid [portion] must be purged via the
bowels. By separating [the clear from the turbid] and eliminat-
ing them at the front and the back, distention and fullness are
diminished and water fluids move [normally once more], The
Spleen qi revolves and body fluids are generated.

This method of separation is a very important treatment
principle in Chinese medicine that comports with the divi-
sion of body fluids into clearer and more turbid portions,
and with the different methods used in Chinese medicine to
drain dampness via the urine and guide out phlegm via the
bowels.

Note: The reader is referred to the discussion in Chinese
Herbal Medicine: Materia Medica of herb identification re-
lated to fang ji (Stephaniae/Cocculi/etc. Radix). At present,
Stephaniae tetrandrae Radix (han fang ji) is the herb that is
used for fang ji.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a wide variety of biomedically-defined disorders
including pleural effusions, acute bronchial asthma, edema
from cardiopulmonary disease, ascites, pyloric obstruction,
rheumatic heart disease, and functional gastrointestinal dis-
orders.
