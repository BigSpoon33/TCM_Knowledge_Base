## 💡 Clinical Notes & Commentary

### Traditional Understanding
"Su Zi Jiang Qi" means "perilla seed to direct qi downward" - addressing rebellious lung qi that fails to descend normally. Classic formula for chronic respiratory conditions with phlegm accumulation and underlying weakness. Balances qi direction with phlegm resolution and constitutional support.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows antitussive, bronchodilating, and anti-inflammatory effects. Su Zi contains compounds that help relax bronchial smooth muscle and reduce inflammation. Phlegm-resolving herbs support normal respiratory secretion function. Studies demonstrate benefits in COPD, chronic bronchitis, and asthma.

### Clinical Experience
Excellent for chronic respiratory conditions in elderly or weak constitutions. Particularly effective for people with chronic cough that worsens when lying down or during weather changes. Often used long-term for COPD and chronic bronchitis. Best results when combined with breathing exercises and environmental modifications.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, Su Zi should be lightly crushed before cooking
**Timing**: Between meals, can increase frequency during cough episodes
**Duration**: 4-12 weeks for chronic conditions, often long-term maintenance
