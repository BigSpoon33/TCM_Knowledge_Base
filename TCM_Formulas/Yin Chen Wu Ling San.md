"Yin Chen Wu Ling San" combines the liver-protective and jaundice-clearing action of Yin Chen Hao with the water-regulating power of Wu Ling San. This addresses the common pattern where liver damp-heat causes both jaundice and fluid retention. The formula treats both the local liver problem and the systemic water metabolism dysfunction.

### Modern Pharmacology
Research shows hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and diuretic effects. Yin Chen Hao contains compounds that protect liver cells and promote bile flow. Wu Ling San herbs support kidney function and fluid metabolism. Studies demonstrate benefits in viral hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and drug-induced liver injury.

### Clinical Experience
Essential formula for acute hepatitis with jaundice and fluid retention. Particularly effective for people with liver disease who develop edema or ascites. Often provides rapid improvement in jaundice within 1-2 weeks. Best results when combined with lifestyle modifications and medical monitoring.

### Dosage & Administration
**Standard Dose**: Decoct above doses twice daily, or 6-9g granules twice daily
**Preparation**: Standard decoction, Yin Chen Hao can be increased for severe jaundice
**Timing**: Between meals for better absorption
**Duration**: 2-6 weeks for acute conditions, longer for chronic liver disease
