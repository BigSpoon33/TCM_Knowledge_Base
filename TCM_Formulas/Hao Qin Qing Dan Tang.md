Formulas that Dispel Summerheat and Facilitate the Resolution of Dampness 241

Decoct with one slice of Citrulli Exocarpium (xi gud). For more se-
vere manifestations of summerheat damage than those treated by the
principal formula. Also for the treatment of summerheat diarrhea
and lurking summerheat. Compared to the principal formula, Mas-
ter Lei’s Method for Clearing, Cooling, and Scouring Out Summer-
heat (Lei shi ging lidng di shu fa) focuses more strongly on guiding
out summerheat via the urine and on clearing heat from the Heart.

enhance its effectiveness. Note that the source text calls for ‘offi-
cial cinnamon’ (‘B #£ gudn gui), which is a form of Cinnamomi
Cortex (rdw gui) taken from the thinner bark of trees that are

» between 6- and 7-years old and which has less oil than the more
commonly-used herb. The formula is generally prepared as a
decoction with a proportionate reduction in the dosage of each
ingredient.

ey i ae Ses

Actions Expels summerheat, clears heat, transforms the qi, and
& promotes the resolution of dampness

Indications

Fever, headache, irritability, thirst, urinary difficulty with re-
duced urine, or, in severe cases, sudden turmoil disorder (si-
multaneous vomiting and diarrhea) with abdominal fullness,
pain, or stifling sensation during the summer.

This is summerheat with internal stagnation of water and
dampness. Summerheat causes fever and headache. It injures
the qi and fluids, which causes irritability and thirst. Inter-
nally, dampness leads to stagnation and the obstruction of
the qi dynamic, which causes urinary difficulty with reduced
output of urine. When summerheat-dampness is severe, in-
jury to the Spleen and Stomach may occur; this disrupts their
ascending and descending functions, and can lead to sudden
turmoil disorder.

This formula is also used to treat vomiting, diarrhea, and
fright wind in children caused by summerheat.

Analysis of Formula

The chief ingredient in this formula is Talcum (hud shi).
Sweet, cooling, and slippery, it unblocks stagnation, promotes
passage through all the orifices, clears and resolves summer-
heat, and harmonizes the Stomach. It focuses on the central
disease dynamic of this pattern as well as on both of the
pathogens, summerheat and dampness. Two other minerals,
Gypsum fibrosum (shi geo) and Glauberitum (han shui shi),
serve as deputies. Both are acrid and cooling and strengthen
the heat-clearing action of the formula. Together, the three
minerals in the formula also develop a downward-directing
action that promotes unblocking of the Triple Burner. Unlike
bitter, cooling herbs, the sweet and salty flavor of these min-
erals does not dry the fluids or constrain the qi.

The various assistants in the formula focus on promot-
ing the resolution of dampness. Polyporus (zhii ling), Poria
(fu ling), and Alismatis Rhizoma (ze xi2) promote urination
and expel dampness. Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma
(bdi zhi) strengthens the Spleen. Together, these four ingre-
dients restore the ascending and descending functions of the
qi mechanism, transform the Bladder qi, and alleviate sudden
turmoil disorder. Cinnamomi Cortex (rou gui) assists in the
transformation of qi in the lower burner. Its warming and
drying nature also counterbalances the very cooling nature
of the chief and deputies. Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo) func-
tions as the envoy that harmonizes the diverse actions of the
formula. Together with Talcum (hud shi), it aids in the clear-
ing of heat, and together with Poria (fu ling) and Atractylodis
macrocephalae Rhizoma (bdi zhu), it strengthens the Spleen.

The balanced dynamic of the formula permits it to clear
heat and promote proper water metabolism, and to expel
pathogenic heat and water, without damaging the normal qi.

Cautions and Contraindications

This formula is indicated for treating summerheat dam-
age presentations characterized by overwhelming heat and
dampness, or heat that is more pronounced than dampness.
It is not indicated for relatively mild presentations or for pat-
terns where dampness is more pronounced than heat.


242 Chapter 5 / Formulas that Dispel Summerheat

Commentary

This is a combination of Five-Ingredient Powder with Poria
(wii ling sen) from Discussion of Cold Damage (discussed in
Chapter 16), Six-to-One Powder (litt yi sdn) by Liu Wan-Su
(discussed above in this chapter), and Sweet Dew Powder
(gan lu scin) by the famous Song-dynasty pediatrician Qian
Yi. Sweet Dew Powder (gan lit sdin), first listed as Jade Dew
Powder (yi: lx sen) in Craft of Medicines and Patterns for
Children, is composed of Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao), Glau-
beritum (hdn shui sht), and Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo). It
is indicated for “exuberant heat generating wind with a ten-
dency to fright twitching.” This influence explains the special
indication of the present formula in the treatment of sum-
merheat disorders in children. At present, the formula is gen-
erally prescribed for a somewhat more severe condition of
summerheat (located at a slightly deeper level) than the heat
for which Six-to-One Powder (lit: yi san) is indicated.

In The Refined in Medicine Remembered, the late-Qing
physician Fei Bo-Xiong observed that the use of this formula
is indicated “when the underside of the tongue [looks] rough
while the upper side appears as if there were chewed grains of
rice on top.” This reflects damage to the fluids in the interior
(the underside or yin part of the tongue) with dampness ob-
structing the Triple Burner (the upper or more yang part of
the tongue).

Comparison
> Vs. Six-TO-ONE PowDER (lit yi sdin)

Both of these formulas contain Talcum (hud sht) and Glycyr-
rhizae Radix (gan cdo) to unblock the constraint of summer-
heat and dampness. Comparing the two, the action of Six-to-
One Powder (lit yi sdn) is relatively mild. It is indicated for
a milder disease dynamic in which dampness predominates
and is focused on the Triple Burner and Bladder, Cinnamon
and Poria Sweet Dew Drink (gui ling gan lu yin), on the other
hand, is a large formula indicated for more severe presen-
tations where both heat and dampness are pronounced. In
addition to the Triple Burner, it focuses on the Stomach and
Intestines,

Pogostemonis/Agastaches Herba (hud xidng), and Aucklandiae

Compared to the principal formula, Three Minerals Decoction (san

in clearing summerheat. Physicians in contemporary China also use
the formula for treating phlegm-heat in contexts where they are con-
cerned about damaging the fluids with acrid, drying herbs.

Note: Succus Faecalis Aureus (4 it jin zhi) is made by putting
loose human stool in a clay pot and sealing it. It is then buried for
three years and consumed. This substance is the clear water in the
clay pot. It strongly clears heat and resolves toxicity. At present, it is
not used; instead, either Isatidis Folium (da ging ye) or Coptidis Rhi-
zoma (hudng lidn) is substituted.

FORMULAS THAT DISPEL
SUMMERHEAT AND AUGMENT THE QI

As a yang pathogen, summerheat can readily damage the qi.
This leads to symptoms such as fatigue and a deficient pulse
that accompany the primary manifestation of heat. Such pre-
sentations require the use of treatment strategies that aug-
ment the qi in order to dispel summerheat. Formulas used
for this purpose include herbs like Ginseng Radix (ren shen),
Pseudostellariae Radix (tai zi shen), or Panacis quinquefolii
Radix (xi ydng shen) that tonify the qi and generate fluids.
These are combined with other herbs that augment the qi
and strengthen the Spleen and Stomach, such as Atractylo-
dis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bdi zhi) and Astragali Radix
(hudng qi); with bitter, cooling herbs like Anemarrhenae Rhi-
zoma (zhi mtu) and Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn) that drain
heat from the interior; and with herbs like Lophatheri Herba
(dan zhi ye) and Alismatis Rhizoma (ze xie) that facilitate
the resolution of dampness. Where damage to the qi is at-
tributable to excessive sweating, qi deficiency will be accom-
panied by damage to the fluids. For these patterns, formulas
like Generate the Pulse Powder (sheng mai sdn) that tonify
both the qi and yin should be used.

Actions Clears summerheat, augments the qi, nourishes the
® yin, and generates fluids

Indications

Fever, profuse sweating, irritability, thirst, scanty and dark
urine, fatigued limbs, shortness of breath, apathy, and a defi-
cient, rapid pulse.

This is summerheat injuring the qi and fluids. When sum-
merheat penetrates to the interior there is fever, irritability,
and a rapid pulse. The heat ‘steaming’ internally forces open
the interstices and pores and causes profuse sweating. Sum-
merheat, a yang pathogenic influence, readily injures the flu-
ids, which is compounded by profuse sweating. This results
in thirst with a desire to drink and dark, scanty urine. Qi
attaches to the sweat as it leaves the body, causing qi defi-
ciency with fatigued limbs, shortness of breath, apathy, and a
deficient pulse.

Analysis of Formula

One of the chief herbs in this formula is Panacis quinquefolii
Radix (xi ydng shen), which augments the qi, generates flu-
ids, nourishes the yin, and clears heat. In this it is aided by
Dendrobii Herba (shi hu) and Ophiopogonis Radix (mai men
deng), which nourish the yin of the Lungs and Stomach. The
other chief herb, Citrulli Exocarpium (xi gud), is an impor-
tant substance for clearing heat and releasing summerheat. It
is aided by Nelumbinis Caulis (lidn geng), which has similar
functions. The assistants include Lophateri Herba (dan zhu
ye) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mii), which clear heat
and resolve irritability and thirst. The bitter, cold Coptidis
Rhizoma (hudng lidn) is especially effective in quelling fire.
Here it is used to assist in clearing heat and expelling sum-
merheat. The other assistants, Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo)
and Nonglutinous rice (jing mi), augment the qi and nourish
the Stomach. Not only do these ingredients assist in treat-
ing the underlying condition, they also prevent the cloying
nature of the yin-nourishing herbs and the cold nature of the
heat-clearing herbs from upsetting the Stomach.

Cautions and Contraindications

Because of the large number of cloying, yin-nourishing
herbs, this formula should not be used without considerable
modification in cases of summerheat-dampness. It is also in-


244 Chapter 5 / Formulas that Dispel Summerheat

appropriate for conditions in which the pathogenic influence
has already been resolved.

Commentary

From a five-phase perspective, fire controls metal. Summer-
heat is an excess of fire that damages metal, injuring both the
qi and fluids. For this reason, physicians associated with the
warm pathogen disorder current in Chinese medicine assign
an important role to the Lungs in the onset of both wind-
warmth and summerheat disorders. The Lungs generate flu-
ids by directing qi downward. Water follows this movement
to stream into the Kidneys, which is why the Lungs are called
the ‘upper source of water’ If Lung qj is insufficient, it cannot
direct this downward movement and fluids are lost through
sweating. Hence, even though this formula focuses on clear-
ing heat and augmenting the qi, its ultimate purpose is to
conserve the fluids. In this, as discussed in the COMPARI-
SON section below, it resembles formulas like White Tiger
plus Ginseng Decoction (bdi hu jid ren shen tang) and Lopha-
therum and Gypsum Decoction (zhu ye shi gdo tang).

This formula was composed by Wang Shi-Xiong, who
included it in a commentary on Xue Sheng-Bai’s Writings
on Damp-Heat Pathogen Diseases. Xue Sheng-Bai had sug-
gested using Li Dong-Yuan’s Clear Summerheat and Aug-
ment the Qi Decoction (qing shit yi qi tang), listed below, to
treat “damp-heat patterns [where] damp-heat has damaged
the qi [as reflected in] fatigued limbs, diminished vitality,
generalized fever, shallow breathing, Heart irritability, yellow
urine, thirst, sweating, and a deficient pulse.” Wang Shi-Xiong
voiced his reply in Warp and Woof of Warm-Heat Pathogen
Diseases: “The pulse and pattern all indicate that this [condi-
tion] should be treated by clearing summerheat and aug-
menting the qi. Although Li Dong-Yuan’s formula defines
itself as clearing summerheat, it does not really do this.’ To
distinguish Wang Shi-Xiong’s formula from that of Li Dong-
Yuan, it is also known as Wang’s Decoction to Clear Summer-
heat and Augment the Qi (Wang shi qing shu yi qi tang).

Comparisons

>» Vs, WHITE TIGER PLUS GINSENG DECOCTION
(bdi hu jid ren shen tang)

Both of these formulas treat heat excess with sweating and a
deficient pulse. White Tiger plus Ginseng Decoction (bdi hu
jia ren shen tang) is indicated for patterns characterized by
pathogenic heat collecting in the qi aspect. The momentum
of this heat is to discharge outward, thereby depleting the qi.
Clear Summerheat and Augment the Qi Decoction (ging shu
yi qi tang) treats summerheat collecting in the qi aspect. Sum-
merheat connects with the Heart. The effect of this heat is to
obstruct and dry out, causing irritability, yellow urine, and a
dry mouth. Hence, this formula replaces Gypsum fibrosum

(shi gao) with Coptidis Rhizoma (hudng lidn) to remove the
obstruction caused by the heat.

> Vs. LOPHATHERUM AND GyPsUM DECOCTION
(zhi ye shi gao tang)

Clear Summerheat and Augment the Qi Decoction (ging shu
yi qi tang) is widely regarded as a modification of Lopha-
therum and Gypsum Decoction (zhi ye shi gdo tang), which
also can be used to treat summerheat damage. However, the
latter formula is better suited for lingering heat in the Stom-
ach that has not been completely cleared. Thus, its presenta-
tion includes symptoms like nausea and rebellious qi. Clear
Summerheat and Augment the Qi Decoction (ging shu yi qi
tang) focuses on the Lungs. Its presentation therefore includes
symptoms like sweating and shortness of breath.

Panacis quinquefolii Radix (xi ydng shen) is often substituted for
Ginseng Radix (ren shen). The modern dosage (in parentheses) is
larger than the dosage recommended in the source text. Clears sum-
merheat, augments the qi, strengthens the Spleen, and dries damp-
ness. For one with qi deficiency who contracts summerheat-damp-
ness characterized by fever, headache, thirst, spontaneous sweating,
fatigued limbs, loss of appetite, a sensation of fullness in the chest
and a heavy body, loose stools, dark, scanty urine, a greasy tongue
coating, and a deficient pulse.

The source text prescribes this formula for “for one who has over
time exhausted their Spleen and Stomach by irregular eating or ex-
haustion, is assailed by the heat of summertime, and becomes ill”
To treat this condition, Li Dong-Yuan modified Tonify the Middle to
Augment the Qi Decoction (bu zhong yi qi tang), adding herbs that
transform and leach out dampness, move the qi, and generate flu-
ids to create what he called “a clearing and drying prescription.” The
source text also lists a number of variations:

For severe discharge of sweat [leading to] fluid abandonment that
must be urgently stopped, add Schisandrae Fructus (wti wei zi),
dry-fried Phellodendri Cortex (chdo hudng bai), and Anemarrhenae
Rhizoma (zhi mi). These [herbs] restrain and gather in. For damp-
heat encroaching on the Kidneys and Liver with abnormal walking,
atrophied and weak legs, and both feet askew, when [the patient]

has already been attacked by an atrophy pathogen, add wine-washed
Phellodendri Cortex (iti hudng bai) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma

(zhi mii) to let the force of qi gush out through both feet. If the bowel
movements are bound up and stagnant, occuring just every second or
third day and causing loss of appetite, there is heat lurking within the
blood so that it does not get moistened. Add Angelicae sinensis radicis
Caput (dang gui teu), Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di hudng), ground
Persicae Semen (tdo ren ni), and ground Cannabis Semen (hud md ren
ni) to moisten it.

Through the centuries, physicians, among them the 17th-century
writer Wang Shi-Jie and the contemporary scholar Qiu Pei-Ran,
have recommended Li Dong-Yuan’s formula for obese or deficient
patients (indicating Spleen deficiency) who contract a summerheat
pathogen. Not everyone, however, shared this view. The 19th-century
scholar-physician Fei Bo-Xiong is representative of the doubters. Fei
observed that this formula

is extremely complex in terms of its constituents. It contains tonify-

ing herbs to tonify and eliminating herbs to eliminate, ascending

herbs to ascend, and downward-draining herbs to drain. But how

do they know where it is appropriate to go? The main focus of treat-

ment is to direct downward because chest fullness and gasping for

breath are listed [as symptoms]. Therefore, Astragali Radix (hudng

qi) and Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng md) would be contraindicated.

In my opinion, it is sufficient to clear the Heart, nourish the Stomach,
strengthen the Spleen, and promote the resolution of dampness. Why
make such a big effort for such a trifling matter? It is my sincere con-
viction that because of formulas such as this, Dong-Yuan does not
deserve the flattery [he is so often accorded].

Section 5

FORMULAS THAT DISPEL SUMMERHEAT
AND PRESERVE THE BODY FLUIDS

Summerheat has a yang, rising, and dispersing nature. It
causes sweating and readily damages the body fluids. In the
early stages of summerheat disorders, one guards the yin by
focusing on the yang. The key strategies are to clear heat to
stop sweating and resolve constraint within the Triple Burner
by facilitating the resolution of dampness. Herbs like Ophio-
pogonis Radix (mai men dong) or Panacis quinquefolii Ra-
dix (xi ydng shen) that generate fluids may be added to these
formulas as assistants. The use of sour, astringent herbs is
avoided, however, as this may prevent the effective discharge
of pathogenic heat. Only when damage to the body fluids
becomes a dominant aspect of a presentation—reflected
in such manifestations as wasting and thirsting disorder, a
cracked tongue, or a thin pulse—does it become necessary to
shift strategies. The formulas in this section utilize sour, as-
tringent herbs like Mume Fructus (wit mei) and Chaenomelis
Fructus (mu gud) to astringe the fluids and prevent the loss of
yin essence. They combine these sour herbs with bitter, cold
herbs that drain heat from the interior and sweet, cold herbs
that enrich the yin and generate fluids.
