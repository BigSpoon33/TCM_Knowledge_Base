Decoction. Clears heat, drains fire, dissipates clumps, and resolves
toxicity. Indicated for massive febrile disorder of the head with severe
swelling of the face and neck, chills and fevers, thirst, a white greasy
tongue coating, and a wiry, slippery, and rapid pulse. The condition
arises from obstruction of the upper burner by the pathogens wind,
dampness, and heat. This formula was composed by Kong Bo-Hua,
one of the Four Great Master Physicians (#9 4.84 ¥ si da ming yi) of
Beijing during the middle part of the 20th century, and unlike the
original formula, reflects his personal emphasis on warm pathogen
therapeutics.

Indications

Sensation of heat and irritability in the chest and abdomen,
delirious speech (in severe cases), thirst, flushed face and red
lips, mouth and tongue sores, sore throat, swollen tongue, red
eyes, nosebleed, constipation, dark, scanty urine, red tongue

*Plum Blossom Dotted Tongue Special Pill (4 7255& 5} mei hua didn she
dan) is a formula originally found in Complete Compendium of Patterns and
Treatments in External Medicine. Because many of the ingredients in this
formula have heavy metal toxicity or come from endangered species, it is
presently considered obsolete and should not be added to this formula.

body or edges with a dry, yellow, or white coating, and a rap-
id, possibly slippery pulse.

This pattern is one of formed or accumulated heat in the
middle burner, and unformed or blazing heat in the upper
burner. Heat in the chest and diaphragmatic regions produces
a sensation of heat and irritability which, in severe cases, may
evolve into delirious speech. Heat in the Stomach and In-
testines injures the fluids and prevents them from rising to
the mouth, which causes thirst. Dryness due to heat clump-
ing in the yang organs interrupts the smooth flow of qi and
causes constipation and dark, scanty urine. Heart fire blazing
upward produces a flushed face, red lips, mouth and tongue
sores, sore throat, and a swollen tongue. Heat in the Lungs,
Heart, Spleen, and Liver manifests in signs of inflammation in
their corresponding sensory organs (the nose, tongue, mouth,
and eyes, respectively). A tongue with red edges and a white
coating indicates that the heat is lodged primarily in the up-
per burner; redness covering the entire body of the tongue
and a yellow coating indicates that heat is firmly established
in both the upper and middle burners. A dry coating reflects
the presence of dryness. A rapid pulse indicates heat, while a
slippery pulse indicates clumping due to the accumulation of
heat and dryness in the interior.

Analysis of Formula

In this pattern there is both unformed heat above and formed
accumulation below, which requires a strategy of simultane-
ously clearing the heat and reducing the accumulation. The
use of only one strategy will not alleviate the condition.

The large dose of Forsythiae Fructus (lidn gide) indi-
cates that it serves as the formula’s chief herb, clearing heat
and resolving toxicity. It enters the Heart channel to disperse
pathogenic heat, eliminates all types of heat from the upper
burner, and is a specific herb for treating sores. Two pair of
deputies focus the action of the formula on the upper and
middle burners. Scutellariae Radix (hudng gin) drains lurk-
ing heat from the Lungs and clears constrained heat from
the diaphragm. Gardeniae Fructus (zhi zi) clears heat from
all three burners through the urine and guides fire out from
below. The second pair, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng)
and Natrii Sulfas (mdng xiao), opens the bowels to flush heat
from the middle burner.

Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bd he) and Lophatheri
Herba (dan zhu ye) are light in nature. They serve as assis-
tants that calm irritability and alleviate the attendant head
and throat symptoms by dredging the protective qi and vent-
ing heat from the exterior. Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cdo) and
the small amount of honey act as envoys that moderate and
harmonize the fierce action of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da
hudng) and Natrii Sulfas (mang xiao), protecting the Stomach
and preventing the abdominal pain that sometimes accompa-
nies the use of purgatives.


Formulas that Clear Heat and Resolve Toxicity 177

Overall, this formula can be interpreted as a variation of
Regulate the Stomach and Order the Qi Decoction (tido wei
cheng qi tang) to which herbs that dredge the protective qi
and clear heat from the upper burner have been added. This
allows it to drain accumulation of heat from the upper and
middle burners simultaneously, a strategy first discussed in
Chapter 74 of Basic Questions: “Internal hot pathogenic influ-
ences should be treated with salty, cold [substances] assisted
by [those that are] bitter and sweet.”

Cautions and Contraindications

The use of this formula can readily injure the Spleen and
Stomach qi. The dosage of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng)
and Natrii Sulfas (mdng xido) should therefore be reduced or
omitted altogether once the constipation has been alleviated,
or with the appearance of mild abdominal pain, pus in the
stool, and fatigue. This formula is appropriate only for condi-
tions of heat excess in the upper and middle burners, and is
contraindicated during pregnancy and for patients who are
very weak.

Commentary

Almost all commentators agree that the formula clears and
drains heat from the upper and middle burners. Their views
regarding the relative importance of each herb in the formula
vary depending on which of the two actions they consider
to be primary. A minority even extends the formula’s action
to all three burners. The mid-19th century scholar-physician
Fei Bo-Xiong, for instance, argued that the combination of
Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) and Natrii Sulfas (mdng
xiao) also drains heat from the lower burner. Ding Xue-Ping,
a contemporary physician from Shanghai, provides another
divergent commentary in Modern Explanations of Ancient
Formulas:

This [formula] represents a joint strategy of dredging wind
with acrid and cooling [substances], draining fire with bitter
and cold [substances], and thrusting out [pathogens] via
purgation with salty and bitter [substances. Its authors thereby]
established the correct way [to treat] pathogenic fire that col-
lects and clumps in the exterior, the interior, and the Triple
Burner [simultaneously].

In Convenient Reader of Established Formulas, the late-Qing
dynasty physician Zhang Bing-Cheng focused on describing
the disease dynamic that leads to this pattern:

All the various manifestations of this pattern outlined above
are due to pathogenic fire in the upper and middle burners that
is accompanied by clumped matter in the Stomach [made up
of] harbored food or stools. Fire that has scattered, irrespective
of whether it is [now] located in the interior or exterior, can

be cured by clearing and dispersing. However, if [such fire] is
accompanied by formed matter that has clumped and not been
dispersed, one cannot completely recover from such an illness
unless this clumping is [also] eliminated.

This explanation helps us understand the views of the late
17th-century physician Zhang Lu who thought that this for-
mula works best for problems caused by a seasonal warm
pathogen disorder. The source text also indicates its use “for
any type of wind clogging [the qi dynamic]” (—WA# yi
qie feng yong). Wind-heat pathogens quickly penetrate into
the body and can thus remain in the exterior (upper burner,
Lungs), even as they are already entering into the interior
(middle burner, Stomach). The Triple Burner, represented in
the formula’s name by the diaphragm, connects the exterior
and interior, and must of necessity be involved in any such
process.

This is comparable to a combined disorder of all three
yang aspects in a cold damage disorder, which also neces-
sitates a complex treatment strategy that hinges on the lesser
yang. The difference is that in a warm pathogen disorder, heat
in the exterior must be vented by means of light, acrid, and
cooling herbs, whereas in a cold damage disorder, it is dis-
persed by means of acrid, warming herbs.

The scope of this formula’s application has been extended
to the treatment of childhood convulsions, macular rashes,
and various types of pox where the heat evolves into such
intense fire that it produces extremely dark, collapsed sores.
Some practitioners use it for any type of skin disorder associ-
ated with the accumulation of heat in the upper and middle
burners.

Comparisons
> Vs, Major ORDER THE Qi Decoction (da cheng qi tang)

Both formulas flush fire from the middle burner by drain-
ing downward. A useful differentiation of their application
is provided in Comprehensive Medicine According to Master
Zhang:

When Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) and Natrii Sul-

fas (mdng xiao) are combined with the [herbs] that weigh
downward, Magnoliae officinalis Cortex (hou pd) and Aurantii
Fructus immaturus (zhi shi), then lower burner heat is ordered
by them and smoothly drains downward. When they are com-
bined with the light ascending herbs Scutellariae Radix (hudng
qin), Gardeniae Fructus (zhi zi), Forsythiae Fructus (lidn giao),
and Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bd he), then upper burner
heat is curbed and cleared downward.

> Vs. SAPOSHNIKOVIA POWDER THAT SAGELY UNBLOCKS
(fang feng tong sheng san)

Both formulas treat the upper and middle burners and re-
solve the exterior while draining heat from the interior. Sa-
poshnikovia Powder that Sagely Unblocks (fang feng tang
sheng sdn), a modification of the present formula, is stron-
ger at discharging and dispersing wind from the exterior. To
compensate for this dispersing action, it also includes herbs

that tonify the qi and blood. The present formula focuses on
venting heat from constraint in the exterior. It is not indicated
for patterns with wind in the exterior.

Biomedical Indications

With the appropriate presentation, this formula may be used
to treat a variety of biomedically-defined disorders, primarily
infections such as pharyngitis, stomatitis, tonsillitis, biliary
tract infections, acute icteric hepatitis, conjunctivitis, lobar
pneumonia, and multiple furuncles, as well as epilepsy and
chronic renal failure.

Formulas that Simultaneously Clear Heat from the Qi and Blood Levels 179

The source text says to take equal amounts of the ingredients; the
dosages listed above reflect those in most contemporary texts. Clears
heat, drains the Lungs, eliminates phlegm, and regulates the qi. For
accumulation of heat in the Lungs that manifests as wheezing, dis-
tention, and fullness in the chest and diaphragm with copious sticky
phlegm and inhibited stools.

Heat in the diaphragm and chest ascends to scorch the fluids and
gives rise to phlegm-heat in the Lungs. Heat that descends into the
region below the diaphragm can damage the yin and fluids there
and result in heat accumulation in the Stomach and Intestines in the
form of inhibited stools. This formula treats excess phlegm-heat ac-
cumulation in the chest and diaphragm. Because there is an inherent
danger of damaging the normal qi when treating an excess pathogen,
Ginseng Radix (ren shen) is added to mitigate the damage caused by
the pathogen itself and that brought about by the acrid and bitter
herbs used to drain the Lungs. It also includes the moistening herbs
Armeniacae Semen (xing ren) and Mori Cortex (sang bdi pi) to pre-
vent damage to the Lung yin and fluids by the heat pathogen and the
formula’s bitter, drying herbs.

This somewhat balanced approach allows what would otherwise
be a severe formula to be given to patients whose state of qi and flu-
ids might not tolerate a less conservative method. Nonetheless, for
children, the elderly, and those with weak qi, one should reduce or
eliminate Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da hudng) and Natrii Sulfas (mang
xido). If constipation is a factor for these patients, substituting a large
dose of Trichosanthis Fructus (gud Idu) for the harsh draining herbs
may also be useful.The pattern treated by Ginseng Decoction to
Drain the Lungs (ren shen xie fei tang) is one that often results from a
wind-cold or wind-heat pathogen that sinks into the Lungs and dia-
phragm and transforms to phlegm-heat accumulation. In Western
medicine, this often corresponds to bronchitis, pneumonia, tonsil-
litis, or pulmonary tuberculosis,

FORMULAS THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY
CLEAR HEAT FROM THE QI
AND BLOOD LEVELS

When heat toxin enters the body in the course of an epidemic
disorder, it can flood the entire body and produce patterns in
which heat flares in both the qi and blood levels at the same
time. Clinical manifestations include qi-level symptoms such
as high fever, irritability, and thirst, accompanied by bleeding
from the upper orifices and bleeding into the skin caused by
chaotic movement of the blood, as well as by impaired con-
sciousness and delirious speech due to heat toxin sinking into
the interior. The treatment strategy for such complex disor-
ders is to combine formulas that deal with the individual as-
pects of the pathology into new and larger formulas that can
effectively address these serious and sometimes life-threat-
ening conditions. This requires formulas that combine sub-

stances that clear qi-level heat, such as Gypsum fibrosum (shi
gao) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mii), those that clear
the nutritive and cool the blood, such as Bubali Cornu (shui
niti jido) and Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di hudng), and those
that clear heat and resolve toxicity, such as Coptidis Rhizoma
(hudng lidn) and Scutellariae Radix (hudng qin).
