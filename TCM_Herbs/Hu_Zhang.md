10 I Herbs that Regulate the Blood 
In terms of action, both flowers promote the movement of 
qi and blood, and are used for irregular menstruation, pre-
menstrual breast distention, and abdominal pain due to qi 
and blood stasis. However, while Rosae rugosae Flos (mei 
guf hua) primarily addresses the qi, Rosae chinensis Flos 
(yue jl hua) acts on the blood. 
Rosae rugosae Flos (mei guf hua) enters the Liver and 
Spleen channels, where it restores harmony among the 
Liver, Spleen, and Stomach. It is often used for Liver qi 
constraint accosting the Spleen and Stomach, causing such 
symptoms as a stifling sensation in the chest, belching, 
flank distention, and poor appetite. By contrast, Rosae 
chinensis Flos (yue jl hua) enters the Liver channel alone, 
but because it is stronger at invigorating the blood, it can 
reduce swelling. It also resolves toxicity, and is thus partic-
ularly appropriate for sores due to qi and blood constraint 
transforming into fire, and for scrofula.

Commentary 
Bitter and cold, Polygoni cuspidati Rhizoma (hu zhang) 
enters the Liver, Gallbladder, and Lung channels. Records 
of its clinical use over the centuries depict a growing appre-
ciation for its wide range of clinical actions, which can 
be summed up as follows: invigorates the blood, breaks 
up stasis, expels pathogenic wind, eliminates dampness, 
cools heat, and resolves toxicity. Most recently, its abil-
ity to transform phlegm and stop coughs has received 
significant attention. Miscellaneous Records of Famous 
Physicians notes that it "primarily unblocks and facilitates 
the menstrual blood, breaks up retained blood, masses, and 
clumps" while Omissions from the Grand Materia Medica 
adds that it "governs wind in the midst of the joints, as well 
as blood stasis." Materia Medica of South Yunnan further 
notes that it 
attacks all toxic swellings, stops sore throat, facilitates uri-
nation, and travels through the channels and collaterals. It 
treats the five painful urinary difficulties with turbid urine, 
as well as bleeding hemorrhoids, sores, and red-and-white 
vaginal discharge in women. 
Description of the Materia Medica elaborates: 
It expels clumped heat from the source of blood's genera-
tion and transformation; thus, when treating the blood 
organ of arm terminal yin [Pericardium] or the wind organ 
of leg terminal yin [Liver], the effects are immediate ... 
formula books record its use for painful urinary dribbling, 
because [Zhu] Dan-Xi held that it is an important herb for 
painful urinary dribbling in older people with qi and blood 
deficiency; [in these cases] it is used in conjunction with 
torrifying herbs. It is said that people with deficiency will be 
injured if they take it, so it should indeed be used together 
with torrifying herbs. 
The fresh herb is ground and applied topically for burns, 
sores, hemorrhoids, and other skin infections. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"It is said that people with deficiency will be injured if they 
take it, so it should be taken together with torrifying herbs." 
(Description of the Materia Medica) 
"Do not consume during pregnancy." (Discussion of Medi-
cinal Properties) 
Toxicity 
Mild side effects have been reported after oral administra-
tion of the herb or its preparations, including dry mouth, 
bitter taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diar-
rhea. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "tiger's cane" 
Li Shi-Zhen explains the meaning of the name tiger's cane 
(Jit;f;t hu zhang): "Cane refers to its stem, tiger refers to 
its variegated color." Further evidence of this derivation is 
its most common alternate name, striped cane (f~;f;t ban 
zhang). 
)oo- WINE-FRIED BusHY KNOTWEED RHIZOME 
(i@ ;i:J Jittt jiu chao hu zhang) 
The herb is mixed with yellow rice wine, left covered briefly 
as it is absorbed, then dry-fried until slightly scorched. This 
method of preparation strengthens its ability to invigorate 
the blood and soothe the sinews, while reducing its slight 
tendency to irritate the digestion. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of thick, twisted, yellowish brown, 
heavy rhizomes. 
Major known chemical constituents 
Anthraquinones: emodin, physcion, chrysophanol, rhein, anthragly· 
coside A, fallacinol, citreorosein, questin, questinol, 2-methoxy-6-
