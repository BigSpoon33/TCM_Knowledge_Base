See Sargassum (hai zao). 
Actions & Indications 
• Reduces phlegm and softens areas of hardness: for various 
kinds of nodules in the neck, such as scrofula or goiter, or a

-
With Sargassum (hai zao) for various nodules including 
goiter, scrofula, and testicular nodules. 
• Promotes urination and reduces swelling: because this 
action is weak, it is used as an adjunctive herb for edema 
and leg qi. 
Commentary 
Eckloniae Thallus (kiln bu) is a salty, cold, moistening herb 
that enters the Liver channel. Its major functions are reduc-
ing phlegm, softening areas of hardness, and mobilizing 
fluid metabolism. It is especially indicated for goiter and 
nodules due to phlegm. 
Li Gao observed that 
When goiter is solid like a rock, it cannot be eliminated 
without the use of this herb, which has the effect of'salti-
ness softening areas of hardness.' The details of its nature, 
flavor, and focus of therapeutic [action] are generally the 
same as those of Sargassum (hiii ziio). 
Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Mater-
ia Medica elaborates: 
Eckloniae Thallus (kim bit) is salty, so it softens hardness; 
its nature is moist and it directs downward. It is cold, so it 
dispels heat and disperses clumps, thus it is mainly indicat-
ed for all types of edema, goiter, and accumulated clumped 
qi causing chronic sores on the neck. 
Treasury of Materia Medica observes that "the nature of 
Eckloniae Thallus (kiln bu) is more robust than Sargassum 
(hai zao). It is commonly used for dysphagia, basically uti-
lizing its ability to expel old, stubborn phlegm." 
Comparisons 
> Vs. SARGASSUM (hai zao) 
These two herbs have very similar flavors and therapeutic 
actions. But Sargassum (hai zao) is bitter as well as salty 
and cold; its flavor is turbid, while its cooling action is not 
as pronounced as Eckloniae Thallus (kiln bu). Its overall 
therapeutic actions are accordingly milder .
