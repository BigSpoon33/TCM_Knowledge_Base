## üìñ Overview

Mori Folium (sang ye) enters the Lung and Liver channels, is bitter, sweet, and cold, and light in weight to clear heat and wind from the head and face, disperse Lung heat, and cool exuberant Liver fire.

Overall this herb is light, cooling, and dispersing, while also being sweet, cold, and moistening. It can disperse wind-heat from the exterior, but this effect is rather weak; its action is more specific to cooling and clearing the Lungs and Liver. It is often used to treat such symptoms as headaches, fever, and cough from externally-contracted wind heat, or dry cough from drying heat injuring the Lungs, as well as sore, red, swollen eyes from wind-heat or exuberant Liver fire.

As it cools the Liver, Mori Folium (sang ye) also cools the blood. This action requires a dosage between 15-30g to be effective. While commonly used for vomiting or spitting up of blood, its gentle moistening nature makes it a frequent choice of gynecologists in the central coastal areas of China as an adjunct herb to stop vaginal bleeding.

It is surprising how many of the early materia medica texts gave scant attention to Mori Folium (sang ye), which is completely overshadowed by the mulberry root bark, Mori Cortex (sang bai pi). Until the seventeenth century, few texts mentioned it at all, and those that did included it merely as a footnote to Mori Fructus (sang shen) or Mori Cortex (sang bai pi).

In the section describing Mori Cortex (sang bai pi), the Illustrated Classic of the Materia Medica says: "The best leaves are those which sprout again in the summer and autumn, then picked after the first frost. Boil into soup and wash the hands and feet, as it is particularly effective for painful obstruction from wind."

Zhu Dan-Xi, as always, favored clinical observation over tradition. In Teachings of [Zhu] Dan-Xi, he observes: "Green mulberry second-growth leaves, dried and powdered, mixed with thin rice water and taken on an empty stomach, is exceptional for stopping nightsweats."

The Grand Materia Medica reiterates the indications cited above, and adds the following: "Mori Folium (sang ye) is an arm and leg yang brightness channel herb; if the juice is decocted and used as a tea substitute, it can stop wasting and thirsting disorder."

It appears that the first major breakthrough for Mori Folium (sang ye) came in the formula Eliminate Dryness and Rescue the Lungs Decoction (qing zao jiu fei tang) which was published in the book Precepts for Physicians. The author, Yu Chang, who designed this formula, stressed the importance of Mori Folium (sang ye) in the formula: "Mori Folium (sang ye), following the frost, obtains the metal qi [of autumn], remaining soft and moist without withering, so it is selected [here] as the chief herb."

Yu Chang's inspiration for this formula seems to have come from an influential clinician and expert herbalist, Miao Xi-Yong, who lived the century before, and whose list of favorite herbs featured Mori Folium (sang ye). In his book, Yu Chang defended Miao against those who criticized his techniques as "strange and generally inapplicable":

I say it is not this way at all: there are many who suffer from diseases of dryness in the world; Miao Xi-Yong liked to use moistening prescriptions, and in treating dryness seems to have single-handedly opened a new way of treatment.

Ye Tian-Shi, in Case Records as a Guide to Clinical Practice, gave Mori Folium (sang ye) considerable exposure, including it in formula after formula. He extended the "soft and moist" approach to far more than the treatment of parched Lungs, prescribing it for a vast array of problems including exterior patterns, stroke, abdominal swelling, diarrhea, women's diseases, pediatric conditions, and various types of pox. One reason seems to be that Ye Tian-Shi used Mori Folium (sang ye) as a Liver herb; this is suggested in Materia Medica of Combinations, where it is said to "drain excesses of the east." Ye often combined Mori Folium (sang ye) with Chrysanthemi Flos (ju hua) to calm the Liver, and with Moutan Cortex (mu dan pi) and Gardeniae Fructus (zhi zi) to cool and clear lesser yang constraint.

From that time on, Mori Folium (sang ye) was accepted as an important part of the materia medica. It seems likely that its rise paralleled that of the warm pathogen disease school. It is also possible to trace its usage to the influence of just three individuals: the idea to use it was first attributed to Miao Xi-Yong, it was then incorporated into a very influential formula by Yu Chang, and then its scope was further enlarged by Ye Tian-Shi.
