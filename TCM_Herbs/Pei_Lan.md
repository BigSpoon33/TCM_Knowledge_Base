Nomenclature & Preparation 
As noted in the previous entry, of the two herbs used as 
i 1' hub xiang, that from southern China, Pogostemonis 
Herba (guang hub xiang), is considered superior due to 
its rich, clear aroma and its slightly bitter and acrid flavor, 
which make it very effective. Agastaches Herba is usually 
known simply as .f 1' hub xiang, but to make the differ-
entiation clearer, we have used another of its names, local 
hub xiang ( .±.. .f 1' tu hub xiang). While commonly used, 
it is of secondary quality. When the context makes precise 
identification unclear, we use the name Pogostemonis/ 
Agastaches Herba (hub xiang). 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of thick green stems and branches 
with many leaves and an intense aroma.

CAUTIONS & CoNTRAINDICATIONS 
None noted. See ToxiCITY 
below. 
Actions & Indications 
• Aromatically transforms dampness, awakens the Spleen, 
and regulates the middle: for dampness obstructing the 
middle burner with such symptoms as stifling sensation 
in the chest, lack of appetite, nausea, and a white, moist 
tongue coating. Because it is a neutral herb that does not 
cause dryness, it can also be used for damp-heat in the 
Spleen channel with a sweet, sticky taste in the mouth, 
excessive saliva, and bad breath. 
-
With Pogostemonis/ Agastaches Herb a (huo xiiing) and 
Amomi Fructus rotund us ( dou kou) for dampness obstruct-
ing the middle burner. 
-
With Coptidis Rhizoma (huang /ian) for indigestion due 
to either heat disorders or overindulgence in fat, greasy 
foods. Symptoms include regurgitation of thick, turbid 
fluid, an unpleasantly sticky sensation in the mouth, belch-
ing, and a white, greasy tongue coating. 
• Transforms dampness and releases summerheat: for exte-
rior summerheat-dampness patterns with nausea. Also for 
the early stages of damp-warmth. 
-
With Pogostemonis/ A gas taches Herba (huo xiiing) and 
Artemisiae annuae Herba (qzng hiio) for summerheat-
dampness. 
-
With Talcum (hua shi) and Coicis Semen (yl y! nin) for 
the early stages of damp-warmth. 
• Aromatically dispels middle burner turbid filth to unbind 
the Stomach: for internal accumulation of increasingly 
thickened dampness in the middle burner binding Stom-
ach qi, leading to symptoms such as lethargy, nausea, 
loss of appetite, epigastric and abdominal distention and 
pain, and particularly a thick and greasy tongue coating. 
This pathology can combine with either damp-heat or 
cold-dampness. Usually combined with Pogostemonis/ 
Agastaches Herba (huo xiiing) for this purpose. 
... Add Amomi Fructus rotund us (bai dou kou), Cur-
cumae Radix (yu jln), and Scutellariae Radix (huang qin) 
when turbid filth has combined with damp-heat to bind the 
Stomach qi, so that in addition to the symptoms mentioned 
above, there is fever, jaundice, darkish urine, and a yellow-
ish tinge to the greasy tongue coat. 
... Add Perillae Folium (zf su ye), Pinelliae Rhizoma 
preparatum (zhl bim xia), and Citri reticulatae Pericarpium 
(chen pi) when turbid filth has combined with cold-damp-
ness to bind Stomach qi, leading (in addition to the symp-
toms above) to chills, fever, nausea and dry retching, and a 
white, greasy tongue coating with a greyish tinge. 
Commentary 
Acrid, neutral, releasing, dispersing Eupatorii Herba (pei 
ian) has a harmonious effect, with a clear, fragrant aroma 
that disseminates dampness and transforms turbidity. It 
particularly dispels middle burner turbid filth and old 
putrefied qi in order to unbind the Stomach, while also dis-
persing summerheat-dampness externally. It is often used in 
the treatment of distending headache, stifling sensation in 
the chest, heavy lethargy, and chills and fever due to sum-
merheat-dampness. It treats turbid dampness encumber-
ing the Spleen, sweet, sticky taste in the mouth, excessive 
saliva, and bad breath. This disorder is sometimes known 
as Spleen singularity (AA'-'M pi dan), a term which refers to 
Chapter 47 of Basic Questions where it is described as a 
problem that results from the overconsumption of sweet 
foods that leads to obesity, and then to a form of wasting 
and thirsting disorder marked by a sticky, sweet taste in the 
mouth. However, it is not at all clear that Eupatorii Herba 
(pei ian) is the herb referred to in the original text, as it 
only mentions P.9 ian, which could be one of a number of 
plants. Nonetheless, Eupatorii Herba (pei ian), especially 
in its fresh form, is very effective for treating this problem, 
as well as many other conditions marked by a sticky, sweet 
or metallic taste. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
);;>- WITH POGOSTEMONIS/ AGAST ACHES HERBA (huo xiiing) 
The combination of these two herbs is extremely common 
in the clinic, as both of them awaken the Spleen, harmonize 
the Stomach, and transform dampness. Furthermore, the 
ability of Pogostemonis/ Agastaches Herb a (huo xiiing) to 
reach out to the exterior extends the therapeutic range of 
this combination, while the ability of Eupatorii Herba (pei 
ian) to promote urination provides a route out of the body 
for the transformed dampness. 
Together these herbs excel at eliminating any turbid 
yin pathogen in the body, whether located in the exterior 
or interior, externally-contracted or internally-generated. 
For example, in the early stages of a summerheat-damp-
ness or damp-warm disorder, the symptoms include heavy

7 I Aromatic Herbs that Transform Dampness 
lethargy, chills and fever, epigastric discomfort, and a thick, 
greasy tongue coating. This combination can be used as 
the base upon which other appropriate herbs are added 
to expel the external pathogen. If pathogenic dampness 
encumbers the Spleen with a low-grade fever, stifling sen-
sation in the chest and epigastrium, sweet, sticky taste in 
the mouth, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and thick tongue 
coating, this combination likewise serves as a good base for 
the prescription. 
In the summertime the fresh herbs of this pair can be 
combined and taken as a tea to prevent summerheat with 
dampness, as well as the common cold. 
Comparisons 
::o-- Vs. PoGOSTEMONis/AGASTACHES HERBA (hub xiiing) 
and MOSLAE HERBA (xiiing ru) 
All three herbs transform dampness and release the exteri-
or, and all treat turbid dampness encumbering the Spleen, 
or summertime symptoms such as chills, thirst for cold 
beverages, epigastric discomfort, vomiting, and diarrhea. 
They are often used together for treating these indications. 
However, among them, Pogostemonis/Agastaches Herba 
(hub xicmg) excels at stopping nausea, and is an important 
herb in the treatment of nausea and rebellious qi due to 
constrained dampness. Eupatorii Herba (pei ian) has a 
clear aroma that eliminates long-term putrefaction and 
clears away filth, for which it is superior to Pogostemonis/ 
Agastaches Herba (hub xiiing); it is an important herb for 
treating bad breath and a sweet, sticky taste in the mouth. 
Moslae Herba (xiiing ru) transforms dampness, harmo-
nizes the middle, and facilitates urination. It is the most 
powerful of the three herbs for releasing the exterior, fol-
lowed by Pogostemonis/Agastaches Herba (hub xiiing). 
Eupatorii Herba (pei ian) has the weakest exterior-releasing 
action of the three. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"It is forbidden in those with Stomach qi deficiency." 
(Materia Medica of Combinations) 
Toxicity 
No toxic reactions have been reported. However, because 
this herb contains carcinogenic pyrrolizidine alkaloids, its 
use is restricted in some countries. Long-term administra-
tion in high doses may cause liver cancer. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "ornamental orchid" 
;..... EUPATORIUM LEAF (1}R fJj ~ pei ian ye) 
The leaves have a clear, light aroma with milder properties 
than the whole plant. They tend to clear summerheat and 
eradicate filth. 
;..... EUPATORIUM STALK (1}RftH~ pei iangeng) 
If only the stalks are used, they tend to awaken the Spleen, 
transform dampness, unbind the flow of qi, and ease the 
middle. This form is often used for treating dampness 
obstructing the flow of qi, leading to focal distention and a 
stifling sensation in the chest and epigastrium, sweet taste, 
and nausea. 
;..... fRESH EUPATORIUM (.\!f1}R ~ xiiin pei ian) 
This is the fresh whole plant, which has a full flavor and 
strong properties, especially its acrid flavor, which releases 
the exterior, and its aroma, which transforms dampness. 
It is especially effective for treating externally-contracted 
summerheat-dampness with chills and fever, a sensation of 
distention in the head, and a stifling sensation in the chest. 
Also used for bad breath accompanied by a sticky, sweet 
taste in the mouth. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of well-dried, green aerial parts with 
many leaves, intense aroma, and only a few stem parts, 
without roots and foreign matter. The flower buds should 
still be closed. 
Major known chemical constituents 
Volatile oil: p-cymene, neryl acetate, 5-methyoxythymol 
Triterpenes: taraxasterol, taraxasteryl acetate, taraxasteryl pal-
mitate, 8-amyrin acetate, 8-amyrin palmitate, stigmasterol, IS-sito-
sterol 
Organic acids: fumaric acid, succinic acid, palmitic acid, o-cou-
maric acid 
Alkaloids: lindelofine, supinine 
Other constituents: coumarin, octacosanol, thymohydroquinone
