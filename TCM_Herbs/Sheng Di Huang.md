## 📖 Overview

Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) is bitter, sweet, and cold and enters the Heart, Liver, and Kidney channels. Its bitter coldness drains heat, while its cold, sweet, and moistening qualities enrich the yin and moisten dryness. Because it enters the blood level of the Heart and Liver, it can clear heat from the nutritive and blood levels, and drain the pathogenic heat from warm pathogen diseases.

Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) treats insatiable thirst, internal heat, and hot flashes due to yin deficiency, and also bleeding or rashes due to heat in the blood. It is often prescribed whenever there is exhaustion of yin, deficiency of blood, or insufficient fluids.

Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica describes the nature of this herb:

Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) is used as soon as it is dug up; its nature has not undergone steaming or baking, and thus it is sweet, bitter, and very cold .... Its power is directed at cooling heat and draining fire, cooling the blood, and dissolving stagnation.

The rather surprising reference to "dissolving stagnation" refers to a particular type of stagnation that is caused by heat in the blood which dries up its fluid aspect, making it thick and clotted. Once the heat in the blood has been cooled and the fluids have been restored through the use of Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang), there is no longer cause for stagnation.

Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica elaborates:

It is purple in its heart-core [to] unblock the Heart, yellow in the middle [to] enter the Spleen, and black on the outside [to] accrue to the Kidneys. Heavy in flavor but light in aroma, it focuses internally on cooling the blood and enriching the yin, and externally on moistening the skin, making it glossy and lustrous. When patients are deficient and have heat, it should be used.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated where there is significant dampness from Spleen deficiency, or in those with loose stools and abdominal fullness. See Toxicity below.

- Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) cools the blood, but if the patient has weak Stomach qi it may impede digestion.
- Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di huang) tonifies the blood, but for those with excessive phlegm and thin mucus it may bind up the diaphragm.
Traditional Contraindications
Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) cools the blood, but if the patient has weak Stomach qi it may impede digestion; Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di huang) tonifies the blood, but for those with excessive phlegm and thin mucus it may bind up the diaphragm. It is said that after frying Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) with wine, it will not
impede the Stomach, and that after preparing Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di huang) with ginger, it will not bind the diaphragm. In such cases, it is necessary to analyze, in the patient, the degree of both the primal qi and the pathogenic qi before using either [herb]. Their use should be avoided in postpartum patients with poor appetite, diarrhea, or abdominal pain or clumping; deficiency consumption patients with weak Spleen and Stomach leading to unformed stools, and excessive phlegm in the chest and abdomen; and in those where there is a lack of free-flowing qi and obstruction of its ascent and descent. (Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica)

This book also cautions against allowing Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) to come into contact with iron during its preparation or decoction.
