Jiangxi province; that from Sichuan is considered second in qual-
ity.

Actions & Indications 
• Promotes the flow of qi: for qi stagnation leading to prob-
lems in the flow of qi such as cough, distention, or consti-
pation. 
-
With Cinnamomi Ramulus (gul zhl) for stabbing pain in 
the chest and flanks. 
-

Commentary 
This is similar in qualities and actions to Aurantii Fructus 
immaturus (zhi shi), but more gentle in effect. It is best at 
regulating the qi to ease the chest, and reducing painful 
distention in the abdomen. Commentary on the Divine 
Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica notes that "Aur-
antii Fructus (zhi ke) is bitter, draining qi from the very 
highest locations." Pocket Prescriptions adds that, "After 
giving birth, when the Intestine emerges and does not 
retract [here referring to uterine prolapse], it should be

soaked in the soup of decocted Aurantii Fructus (zhi ke). 
After a long time it will then recede." Aurantii Fructus (zhi 
ke) has recently been widely used in the treatment of pro-
lapses of all types, at high doses (around 24g), especially 
in combination with the formula Tonify the Middle and 
Augment the Qi Decoction (bu zhongyl qi tiing). 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
>- WITH CINNAMOMI RAMULUS (gul zhf) 
Aurantii Fructus (zhi ke) breaks up accumulated qi and 
expels focal distention. Cinnamomi Ramulus (gul zhf) 
disperses due to its acrid flavor, and unblocks because of 
its warmth. Changsha Explanation of Medicines observes 
that "Cinnamomi Ramulus (gul zhf) enters and promotes 
movement in the blood level of Liver patients, and mobi-
lizes the channels and collaterals." 
When the dispersing, downward-directing actions of 
Aurantii Fructus (zhi ke) are combined with the warming, 
unblocking and dispersing actions of Cinnamomi Ramulus 
(gui zhf), the circulation of both qi and blood is harmo-
nized, the yang qi is unblocked, and the pain is alleviated. 
This combination can be used in the treatment of stabbing 
pain in the chest and flanks. Because these areas pertain 
to the Liver, practitioners often use Bupleuri Radix (chcii 
hu) and Cyperi Rhizoma (xiiing fu) as their first choice 
of treatment, unaware that Aurantii Fructus (zhl ke) and 
Cinnamomi Ramulus (gul zhf) also enter the Liver and 
regulate the flow of qi and blood, with excellent results for 
chest and flank pain.

Nomenclature & Preparation 
A common alternative reading of the characters for this 
herb's name is zhf qiiw. When only the dried fruit is used, 
it is referred to as unprepared bitter orange ( ± *.?- ~ sheng 
zhi ke). Because the fruit has had a longer time to grow than 
Aurantii Fructus immaturus (zhi shi), it is naturally larger, 
and therefore occasionally known as large bitter orange ( k 
*.?-~ da zhi ke). 
>- DRY-FRIED BITTER ORANGE (:J:;l>*.R~ chew zhl ke) 
The sliced herb is dry-fried (occasionally with bran) until 
slightly yellow. This is also known as prepared bitter orange 
( J()p, ~ zhl zhi ke), and its actions are more moderate 
than unprepared bitter orange. Dry-frying also reduces the 
slight digestive irritation that the sour flavor can cause, and 
is thus more appropriate for elderly or weak patients, or for 
inclusion in tonifyjng formulas to aid digestion. 
>- CHARRED BITTER ORANGE(*.?-~& zhi ke tan) 
The sliced fruit is dry-fried until scorched and blackened 
externally, and the interior has turned dark yellow. It is 
also known as scorched bitter orange (;liLtP-~jiiio zhi ke). 
This method of preparation renders it much less cold and 
allows it to enter the blood level to stop bleeding. It is also 
used for qi blockage disorders associated with bleeding, for 
example, Intestinal wind. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of large fruit with a greenish brown 
surface, hard and solid texture, a small amount of thick 
pulp, and a fresh, aromatic fragrance.
