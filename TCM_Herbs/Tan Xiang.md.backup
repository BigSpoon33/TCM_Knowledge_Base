## 📖 Overview

Acrid, aromatic, and warm, Santali albi Lignum (*tan xiang*) enters the Lung, Spleen, and Stomach channels. It warms and disperses qi stagnation in the chest and above the diaphragm, unblocking cold obstruction, stopping pain, settling nausea, and unbinding the Stomach. It is an important herb in the treatment of qi stagnation in the chest and abdomen causing pain, belching, nausea, and vomiting. Zhang Jie-Bin observed: "Taken in decoction, it can disperse cold qi, stop pain in the Heart and abdomen, arrest sudden turmoil disorder, harmonize the Stomach qi, unbind the diaphragm, stop nausea and vomiting, and promote food intake."

The Detailed Materia Medica makes an illuminating observation: "The aromatic qi of Santali albi Lignum (*tan xiang*) promotes upward movement; it will regulate qi above the diaphragm and chest, in the area of the throat." This indicates its area of action, and explains that the nauseous sensations best treated by this herb are felt in the chest and throat, not the epigastrium. This is why raising Stomach qi in these cases is beneficial. With this in mind, the following passage from Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica becomes comprehensible:

Whenever cold qi clumps in the upper body preventing the intake of food, and [pathogenic] qi rebels upward causing vomiting, despondency, and discomfort, consuming [Santali albi Lignum (*tan xiang*)] can guide the Stomach qi also upward-its power mobilizes upward. It can disperse wind painful obstruction, reducing the swelling and stopping the pain-its power primarily disperses outward. Its actions specifically enter the Spleen and Lungs, unlike the power of Aquilariae Lignum resinatum (*chen xiang*), which primarily directs downward and guides the qi downward.
