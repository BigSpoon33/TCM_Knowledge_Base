## 📖 Overview

Poria is a sweet, bland, and neutral herb. Sweetness tonifies the middle while blandness leaches out dampness. Thus, on the one hand, it tonifies the Heart, Spleen, and Lungs, while on the other, it facilitates the water pathways, unblocks the orifices, and expels pathogenic heat. Its particular characteristic is harmony in both tonification and in promoting urination, supporting the normal while expelling the pathogenic, and is therefore especially appropriate when the Spleen is deficient and there is a simultaneous overabundance of dampness with such symptoms as phlegm and thin mucus, diarrhea, and edema. This harmonious set of functions, which allows the herb to promote urination without injuring the qi, makes it an important choice for promoting urination and leaching out dampness. It can be used whenever there is urinary difficulty, edema, phlegm, or thin mucus, regardless of whether the condition is hot or cold, deficient or excessive.

When the Spleen functions harmoniously, both the Heart and Lungs benefit directly from this source of generative transformation. This is why the herb is often used to treat insomnia and palpitations due to insufficiency of the Heart and Spleen. Yet its ability to leach out dampness, ease the orifices, and dispel pathogenic heat also makes it useful for accumulation of damp-heat in the lower burner causing painful urinary dribbling with ministerial fire blazing in the Kidney channel.

Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica states that "its sweetness enables it to tonify the middle, its blandness facilitates the orifices. When the middle is tonified, the Heart and Spleen are firm; when the orifices are facilitated, pathogenic heat is resolved."

The Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica notes that this herb treats "rebellious qi in the chest and hypochondria." Nowadays, this function is usually given short- shrift. However, some practitioners, such as the noted physician Zhang Ci-Gong, have found it to be very useful in treating running piglet and similar disorders. As these patients also often suffer from insomnia, Zhang used *Poriae Sclerotium Pararadicis* (Fu Shen) instead of Poria (Fu Ling). Interestingly, this was not because he himself regarded it as superior to Poria in this respect (which he did not), but only because it was expected.
