## 📖 Overview

Sweet, bland, and entering the Stomach and Liver channels, Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma (tu fu ling) clears dampness, guides out heat through the urine, and resolves toxicity. While it can remove damp-heat and ease movement of the joints, it is best at treating noxious sores and swellings, and has long been used for the skin lesions and late-stage muscle spasms associated with syphilis, as well as those due to mercury toxicity, which was used in the past to treat syphilis. This herb also treats painful urinary dribbling and vaginal discharge due to toxic dampness.

The *Grand Materia Medica* says that Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma (tu fu ling) can "expel wind-dampness, ease the joints, treat spasms and bone pain, noxious sores and swellings, and resolve the toxins from mercury and vermilion." The early twentieth-century text *Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica* elaborates:

This herb is derived from a vine, the root of which is jointed; by nature, it facilitates the removal of dampness and expels heat, thus it can enter the collaterals to search out and scour away the accumulated toxicity of damp-heat. Regarding its ability to resolve mercury poisoning, while other agents raise to draw the toxins upward, Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma (tu fu ling) leaches and facilitates, guiding it downward and out [of the body]. This is why it is specific for syphilitic sores, it deeply enters the hundred collaterals, treating all of the noxious symptoms such as joint pain and even necrosis, as well as fire toxin moving upward leading to soreness and ulceration of the throat. Even Western trained doctors recognize this is the only effective medicine for syphilis.
