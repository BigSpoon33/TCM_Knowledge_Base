12 I Tonifying Herbs 
Gecko (ge jie) is less able to fortify the yang than any of 
these substances, but it does have the special ability to calm 
wheezing and stop coughs by assisting the Kidney's ability 
to grasp the qi, and to strongly tonify the Lung qi, which 
none of these other herbs has. 
::» v s. CoRDYCEPS (dong chong xia cao ); see page 77 4 
Traditional Contraindications 
"It is forbidden in two [situations]: yin deficiency with dis-
turbed fire, and pathogenic wind causing coughs or wheez-
ing." (Materia Medica of Combinations) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
The gecko is captured, killed, eviscerated, and dried by 
stretching it on strips of bamboo so that its limbs and tail 
are straight. It is baked at a low temperature until dry, 
and then sliced into pieces before use. Traditionally, the 
eyes were thought to be toxic, and the tail the most potent 
part, so the head and legs are generally removed. Modern 
research, however, has not discovered any toxicity in these 
parts. 
The common name for this lizard is wall tiger ( ~ ffL bl 
hu), and larger specimens are preferred, hence the name 
large wall tiger ( :k ~;fL da bl hU). The Chinese name ge jie 
comes from the sound it makes: traditionally, males were 
said to make the sound ge, while females responded with 
jie. 
::» CouPLED GEcKo ('M't~!l!J'r dul ge jie) 
These are two geckos bundled as a pair. There is a tradi-
tion that a pair of mating geckos captured while mating is 
the best medicine for enhancing sexual function. This idea 
is still used in marketing, even though it is rejected in the 
literature: "Even if they are not caught in mutual embrace, 
the effect is still the same. But the therapeutic effect is in 
the tail: if the tail is not complete, it is ineffective." (Seeking 
Accuracy in the Materia Medica ) 
::» OIL-cRISPED GEcKo (ilb ~~~you su ge jie) 
The gecko is coated with sesame oil, then roasted over a 
smokeless fire until slightly yellow and crispy. The head 
and legs are removed, and it is sliced into pieces. The effect 
is the same as the raw gecko, but it has a less objectionable 
smell, and is easier to break up into pieces. Its best actions 
are tonifying the Lungs and augmenting the essence, grasp-
ing the qi and settling wheezing. 
::» WINE-FRIED GECKO (ii!li ;k_;l>~!kj)- jiu chao ge jie) 
Pieces of gecko are mixed with yellow rice wine, left cov-
ered briefly as the wine is absorbed, then dry-fried or baked 
until dry. This method of preparation enhances its ability 
to tonify the Kidneys and fortify the yang, and is thus often 
used for impotence due to deficiency of the Kidney yang, 
essence, and blood. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists oflarge and fat, dried specimens with 
an unfragmented tail section. 
Major known chemical constituents 
Amino acids: glycine, proline, glutamic acid (14 different amino 
acids) 
Phospholipides: phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, 
phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidicacid, lysolecithin 
Fatty acids: linoleic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, linolenic acid, 
palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, arachidonic acid 
Other constituents: carnosine, carnitine, choline, guanine,

Adulterants 
Many adulterants have been encountered: 
Gecko chinensis (~lt b) hu), Gecko japonicus ( § 1t1tlt duo y6u 
bl hu, Y4;AA--H: ge jie wa), Gekko swinhonis ( ~ 
:l1; ~ Jt wu pu bl hu): 
These are generally smaller, with a total length of 12-18cm, tail 
length 5-8cm, width of 5-6cm. By contrast, the standard gecko is 
20-32cm in length (usually about 30cm) with a 6-14cm long tail 
and a width of 6-11cm. 
Agama himalayana ( -l.L "I ;jl[ xi shan lie xi): This has a total length 
of 27-34cm, tail length of 18-20cm, ventral part 4-8cm wide, with 
a dark greyish green dorsum, and greyish brown abdomen. By con-
trast, the standard gecko is greyish black or greyish silver black 
with yellowish white, greenish grey, or brick-red spots, and an 
abdomen that has a slightly lighter color. 
Leiolepis belliana belliana (*lltBi.;j![ Ia pf xi): Its total length is 32-
39cm, tail length 20-25cm, ventral part 3-7 em wide, with a grey-
ish brown dorsum, densely covered with reddish brown spots.

CAUTIONS & CoNTRAINDICATIONS 
Use with caution in those 
with exterior conditions. See ToxiCITY below. 
Actions & Indications 
• Augments the Kidneys and tonifies the yang: for impotence 
and sore and weak lower back and lower extremities associ-
ated with Kidney yang deficiency. 
-
With Eucommiae Cortex (du zhang), Epimedii Herba 
(yin ycing huo), and Cistanches Herba (rou cong r6ng) for 
such symptoms as impotence, sore and weak lower back 
and lower extremities, and spermatorrhea associated with 
Kidney yang deficiency. 
-
With duck, chicken, pork, or fish as a stew for weakness, 
dizziness, spontaneous sweating and other symptoms of 
debility and lowered resistance from weakened protective 
qi. 
-
With Astragali Radix (hucing qi), Atractylodis macro-
cephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu), and Tritici Fructus levis (fu 
xiao mai) for sweating due to weakened protective qi. 
• Tonifies the Kidney yang, augments the Lung yin, trans-
forms phlegm, and stops bleeding: for chronic coughs, 
wheezing from deficiency, or consumptive coughs with 
blood-streaked sputum. Because it tonifies both the yin and 
yang and is a very safe substance, it can be taken over a long 
period of time. 
-
With Glehniae Radix/ Adenophorae Radix (shii shen), 
Fritillariae cirrhosae Bulbus ( chuiin bei mu), and Asini 
Corii Colla (e jiiio) for such symptoms as cough, wheezing 
from deficient Lung yin, coughing up blood from deficient 
Lung yin, and chest pain from Lung yin deficiency. 
Commentary 
Sweet and warm, Cordyceps (dong chong xia cao) is fre-
quently described as a harmonious tonic for both the yin 
and yang. However, because it is harmonious and gentle, 
long-term consumption may be required before results will 
appear. Jottings from Repeated Celebration Hall notes that, 
"with its warm, peaceful, tonifying nature, it is a sage-like 
medicinal for deficiency patterns, focal distention due to 
deficiency, and pain due to deficiency." Omissions from the 
Grand Materia Medica says that it "Treats pangs of pain 
in the lower back and knees, has the effect of augmenting 
Kidneys" and "protects the Lungs and firms the pores and 
interstices." 
Because it tonifies the Lungs, supports the protective qi, 
augments the Kidney yang, transforms phlegm, and stops 
bleeding, it is particularly appropriate for the treatment of 
deficiency in both the Lungs and Kidneys, long-term cough 
or wheezing, and continuous coughing of blood-stained 
sputum in consumption. The Thoroughly Revised Materia 
Medica says that it "Protects the Lungs, augments the 
Kidneys, stops bleeding, transforms phlegm." 
In Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, 
Zhang Shan-Lei undertook a detailed analysis of the prop-
erties and indications of this substance relating to coughs. 
Growing as it does high in the mountains, 
it responds to the [deep, hidden] yang qi generated at the 
arrival of winter, crawling deep into piled snow, by nature 
fearless of the cold-this is its special characteristic ... the 
theory that it is warm and heating can be believed. It is also 
said to tonify the essence and augment the marrow, because 
when the yang is generated, the yin grows, and since it is an 
animal, this is equivalent to 'sympathy between blood and 
flesh'. 
Zhang had previously used cordyceps effectively for treat-
ing coughs: "In the past I used it for the dry coughs of defi-
cient patients resulting from qi gushing upward, their faces 
sallow and pale, their pulses small and forceless, lips and 
tongue pale, white, slippery and moist-it was very effec-
tive." However, as to treating coughs from yin deficiency 
with fire blazing, he had his doubts: 
If the lips and tongue are fresh red, and fire from deficiency 
is blazing upward, I really would not dare use it for fear that 
it would reinforce the yang and disturb the fire within the 
yin, and conversely cause injury. 
Zhang thereupon analyzed many cases of Wang Meng-
Ying, who used this substance frequently, "not to tonify 
the Kidneys and reinforce the yang, but specifically for 
chronic cough due to yin deficiency with qi gushing." He 
found that 


774 
12 I Tonifying Herbs 
in all cases the yin failed to contain the yang, the Liver and 
Kidneys did not hold the qi and fire in store [and it] gushed 
upward to cause coughing. [Wang Meng-Ying] would then 
use Cordyceps (dong chong xiii ciio) in a large prescription 
of herbs that suppressed the yin, harmonized the yang, 
and restrained and inhibited, so that the primal qi could 
be returned, grasped, and reinstated to its residence, abso-
lutely without any disturbance to the Kidney yang. After 
this [analysis] I knew that Cordyceps (dong chong xiii ciio), 
although a warming and tonifying medicinal, definitely had 
sinking, suppressing, and settling properties. 
Zhang Shan-Lei concluded: 
Thus, in recent years, whenever treating long-term stub-
born coughs due to yin deficiency and qi gushing patterns, 
even if the phlegm and blood have not cleared, as long as 
the tongue coating is not too turbid or thick, and the pulse 
comes on small, rapid, weak, and wiry, and the appetite 
remains unaffected, I often use this substance in a formula 
together with enriching, replenishing, and grasping qi 
[herbs], and the effect is very good in many cases, frequent-
ly relieving the lingering illness. 
Comparisons 
}> Vs. GECKO (ge jie) 
Both substances tonify the Lungs and Kidneys, warm the 
yang, augment the essence, and settle coughs and wheez-
ing. Gecko (ge jie) is salty and neutral, calms wheezing, and 
stops coughs by assisting the Kidneys to grasp qi; it also 
strongly tonifies the Lung qi. By contrast, Cordyceps (dong 
chong xia cao) calms wheezing and stops coughs by tonify-
ing the Lung qi, and directing rebellious qi downward; it 
also transforms phlegm, stops bleeding, and stops sweating 
by reinforcing the protective qi. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Should be used with caution in those with exterior patho-
gens." (Sichuan Chinese Herbal Medicines) 
Toxicity 
In one case the following side effects were reported: consti-
pation, abdominal distention, and a decrease in peristalsis. 
There have also been two case reports of irregular men-
struation and one case report of amenorrhea following the 
ingestion of tablets and capsules containing this substance. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "winter bug summer herb" 
There are a number of Cordyceps species of fungi, all of 
which are parasitic, on plants, insects, or even other fungi. 
C. sinensis is a mountainous species limited to southwest 
China. It grows on the caterpillar larvae of insects belonging 
to the order Lepidoptera, particularly moths belonging to 
the genus Hepialus (Hepialidae) and specifically H. armori-
canus, which hibernate under the leaf cover of treed slopes. 
While the precise details of the process remain unclear, it 
appears that the spores germinate and penetrate into the 
moth larva, where the fungus proliferates and infiltrates the 
circulatory system, finally killing the larva. In autumn the 
body of the fungus grows and the larva hardens, leaving its 
outer shell intact. The next spring or early summer, the soft, 
tough, deep brown stroma develops, growing longer than 
the brittle, 3-Smm larva. Before its spores have dispersed, 
both the stroma and the hardened larva are collected. 
This is also known as winter insect herb ( ~ 
11.1f. dong 
chong cao) or simply insect herb (11.1f. chong cao). The 
fungi usually turn up at the same locality every year. 
Because the natural source is limited, production of 
the body of the fungus by fermentation has recently been 
shown to be possible, with very similar clinical efficacy, and 
less toxicity. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of large and full caterpillar bodies 
with a yellowish brown surface, a white and solid surface on 
cross section, and short and thick stromata.
