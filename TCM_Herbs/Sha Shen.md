## 📖 Overview

There are two types of sha shen, northern (Glehnia littoralis) and southern (Adenophora tetraphylla). It was not until 674 with the publication of *Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica* that the two were differentiated. While the descriptions in the older materia medica texts appear to refer to Adenophorae Radix, nowadays, when sha shen is prescribed without specifying the northern or southern variety, Glehniae Radix (bei sha shen) will be dispensed in most parts of China.
