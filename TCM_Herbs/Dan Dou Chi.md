## 📖 Overview

Sojae Semen preparatum (淡豆豉 dan dou chi) is lightweight and floating in nature, with good venting, dispersing, and disseminating actions. Not only does it vent and disperse exterior pathogens, it can also spread and clear constrained heat in the interior. Its sweat-inducing action is very subdued, and is therefore said to "bring out sweat without injuring the yin fluids." Its cooling action is also rather weak, and its ability to disseminate constrained heat in the chest is derived from its power to dredge, vent, and spread. As *Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica* notes: "This is a superior medicinal for venting constraint."

*Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica* elaborates:
Since its flavor is bitter and its temperature cold, one would expect it to be a bitter, downward-directing herb without any power to ascend or lead upward. However, after it is steamed, and despite its bitter flavor, it is aromatic, and although it is cold, it has lifting and dispersing properties. This is why, combined with Allii fistulosi Bulbus (葱白 cong bai), it can induce sweating; with salt it can induce vomiting; with wine it can treat wind; with Chinese leeks (韭菜 jiu cai) it can treat dysenteric disorders [Allii macrostemi Bulbus (薤白 xie bai) was noted for this indication in the *Grand Materia Medica*]; with garlic it can stop bleeding; and when dry-fried until cooked it can stop sweating. Likewise when there is a pathogen in the upper body causing symptoms of irritability, restlessness, headache, stifling sensation in the chest, vexation, insomnia, expression of rashes, and nausea, when combined with Gardeniae Fructus (栀子 zhi zi) it can lead the pathogen upward to be vomited out. This prevents it from descending internally and causing symptoms of internal clumping.

One of the controversies surrounding the combination of Sojae Semen preparatum (淡豆豉 dan dou chi) and Gardeniae Jasminoidis Fructus (栀子 zhi zi) is whether, when it first appeared as the formula Gardenia and Prepared Soybean Decoction (栀子豉汤 zhi zi chi tang) in *Discussion of Cold Damage*, it was meant to induce vomiting. The question arose because of a note following the formula which states ambiguously that if a person vomits after taking it, they should not be given any more. The most reasonable explanation is that this means if a person vomits they should stop taking the formula, not that it is intended to induce vomiting. However, through the ages many writers have characterized the formula as an emetic. Because the formula following this one in *Discussion of Cold Damage* uses the same combination plus Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (生姜 sheng jiang) to stop nausea and vomiting, this reading would seem difficult to defend. Nonetheless, some patients do vomit, and many do feel better having done so. When this occurs, as *Discussion of Cold Damage* points out, the patient should stop taking the herbs.

Some insight into the use of Sojae Semen preparatum (淡豆豉 dan dou chi) can be gleaned from writings about how it is used to treat lurking pathogens. An example is Liu Bao Yi's discussion in *Encountering the Sources of Warm-Heat Pathogen Diseases* about how to treat lurking pathogens in the lesser yin channel of the Kidneys:

In my humble opinion there is nothing better than using Scutellaria Decoction (黄芩汤 huang qin tang) plus Scrophulariae Radix (玄参 xuan shen) and Sojae Semen preparatum (淡豆豉 dan dou chi). It is the most appropriate method by far, with little need for alteration. This is because Scutellaria Decoction (黄芩汤 huang qin tang) is specially designed to drain and cool internal heat. Scrophulariae Radix (玄参 xuan shen) tonifies Kidney yin. Sojae Semen preparatum (淡豆豉 dan dou chi) is made from black soybeans, which themselves enter the Kidney channel, and is made by steaming in a pent-up container- just like the pathogen itself before it begins to emerge. Because its nature and flavor is harmonious and neutral, without the drawback of strong diaphoresis or damage to the yin, it is just right for assisting the expression of a deep lying pathogen in the lesser yin.

## ⚡ Functions & Actions

- **Releases the exterior:** For both hot and cold exterior disorders. Because of its mild character, it is also appropriate for treating patterns of yin deficiency with superimposed exterior disorders.
    - With Allii fistulosi Bulbus (葱白 cong bai), as in Scallion and Prepared Soybean Decoction (葱豉汤 cong chi tang), for fevers with an absence of sweating, epigastric pain, and distention, which is characteristic of the very earliest stage of externally-contracted disorders. Also for colds associated with yin deficiency, as in Scallion Decoction with Seven Ingredients (葱白七味饮 cong bai qi wei yin).
    - With Menthae haplocalycis Herba (薄荷 bo he), Schizonepetae Herba (荆芥 jing jie), and Arctii Fructus (牛蒡子 niu bang zi) for early stages of wind-heat disorders with fever and headache, as in Honeysuckle and Forsythia Powder (银翘散 yin qiao san).
- **Eliminates irritability:** For irritability, restlessness, stifling sensation in the chest, and insomnia following a febrile disorder.
    - With Gardeniae Fructus (栀子 zhi zi) for irritability and stifling sensation in the chest from residual heat, as in Gardenia and Prepared Soybean Decoction (栀子豉汤 zhi zi chi tang).
- **Other combinations:**
    - For blood in the urine, with Liquidambaris Fructus (路路通 lu lu tong) and Lycii Cortex (地骨皮 di gu pi).
