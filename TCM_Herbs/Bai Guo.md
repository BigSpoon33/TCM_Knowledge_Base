  # TCM Properties
  taste: [sweet, bitter, astringent, neutral]
  temperature: "neutral"
  channels: [Kidney, Lung]

  # Clinical Information
  dosage: "4.5-9g"
  toxicity: "These seeds are toxic, with the green embryo being the most toxic part. Toxic reaction usually occurs when too many of the raw or roasted kernels are eaten as nuts, not when taken in decoctions. The toxic dose in children lies between 7-150 kernels, in adults between 40-300 kernels. Symptoms of toxicity appear 1-12 hours after ingestion and include hyperthermia, nausea, vomiting, foamy salivation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, restlessness, convulsions, tonic spasms of the extremities, changes in the size of the pupils, loss of pupillary reflex, dyspnea, cyanosis, and loss of consciousness. Death may occur due to respiratory and circulatory failure 1-2 days after ingestion.

External application of ethanol or ether extract is irritating to the skin causing pruritus, erythema, edema, papules, and pustules. Allergic reactions have also been reported.

Heating the herb reduces its toxicity, as does removal of the outer testa, the thin skin below, and the embryo. While the roasted seeds are still toxic, this is not a major concern if the seeds are then decocted."

## 📖 Overview

**Ginkgo Semen (bái guǒ)** is astringent and inhibiting, enters the **Lung** channel to restrain the **Lung qi**, settle wheezing with profuse phlegm, alleviate turbid vaginal discharge, and contain the urine. It is appropriate for the treatment of cough and wheezing with profuse phlegm, turbid yellow vaginal discharge, painful urinary dribbling, turbid urine, and urinary frequency. When used for cough and wheezing, it is most suitable for patterns which tend toward **heat**.

In **Convenient Reader of Materia Medica**, **Zhang Bing Cheng** says of this herb: "In the upper body, it restrains the Lungs and expels cough due to rebellion; in the lower body, it promotes movement of dampness and transforms phlegm and thick sputum."

**Li Shi-Zhen** elaborates: It has little aroma but a strong flavor, with an astringent nature that restrains; its color is white, it pertains to metal. Thus it enters the **Lung** channel, augmenting the **Lung qi**, settling cough and wheezing, and restraining the urine. Unprepared, and pounded into paste, it can wash away grease, from which its ability to expel turbid phlegm can be inferred.
