10 I Herbs that Regulate the Blood 
Natural copper (zi rein tong) is widely mined, but that 
from Sichuan province is generally considered superior. 
It is usually marketed as squares with a metallic shine. 
However, pyritum is generally used in calcined form. 
);;>- CALCINED PYRITUM (:lit fJ ~ :iJO) duim zi ran tong) 
The pyritum is placed in a heat-resistant container then 
heated at a very high temperature (800°C) for one to two 
hours until red-hot all through. It is then removed and 
immediately quenched in vinegar, in which it is left until 
cooled. The process is then repeated until the color is 
brownish black, the exterior is friable and cracked, and 
there is no longer any metallic shine. It is then removed 
and pulverized. This method of preparation strengthens its 
ability to disperse stagnation and stop pain, assists in the 
decoction process, and assists in pulverization when the 
pyritum is to be used in pill or powder form. 
Note that heating to temperatures higher than 800°C 
may adversely affect its quality. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality is metallic yellow, heavy, lustrous, and with a 
smooth surface. 
Major known chemical constituents 
FeS2 (Fe 46.6%, S 53.4%), Co, Ni, Cu, As 
Adulterants 
Copper pyrite CuFeS2 (if:iR~ huang t6ng kutmg): These are irregu-
larly shaped aggregates of dark golden yellowish or bluish purple 
brown crystals. By contrast, Pyritum (zi ran t6ng) consists of cubic 
crystals, with a lighter color.

10 I Herbs that Regulate the Blood 
649 
Commentary 
Daemonoropis Resina (xue jie) is often classed as a herb for 
external application, but is also taken internally, usually as 
a powder. It enters the blood level of the Liver channel to 
invigorate the blood, disperse stasis, and stop pain, and is 
used for blood pooling due to internal injuries, contusions 
from falls, stabbing pain in the chest and abdomen, and 
gynecological conditions such as amenorrhea or postpar-
tum pain due to blood stasis. 
Externally applied, it is a well-known and valued sub-
stance in the treatment of wounds and sores that fail to 
heal, as it both stops bleeding and generates flesh. 
Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of 
Materia Medica says that it is "an important medicinal for 
dispersing static blood and generating new blood." 
Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica notes that it 
is sweet, such that it harmonizes the blood, closes wounds, 
stops pain, and generates flesh; but it is also salty, such that 
it eliminates and guides out pus. By nature, it specifically 
enters the blood aspect of the Liver channel to break up 
stasis; whenever there are injuries from falls or blows, and 
stabbing pain due to qi and blood [stagnation], or internal 
injuries causing pooling of blood, it should be taken as a 
powder mixed with wine. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
}> WITH ALUMEN DEHYDRATUM (kujan) 
Daemonoropis Resina (xue jie) enters the blood level to 
disperse stasis, arrest pain, stop bleeding, and generate 
flesh. Alumen dehydratum (ku Jan) is drying, inhibit-
ing, and restraining in nature, and also stops bleeding 
and resolves toxicity. Together, with one dispersing and 
the other restraining, the combination can stop bleeding 
without causing stasis, and stasis can be dispersed without 
interfering with the process of generating flesh. 
This combination is almost always applied topically. It 
is particularly effective for wounds from metal blades, but 
can also be used for sores that have perforated but fail to 
heal. 
Comparisons 
}> Vs. OLIBANUM (ru xitmg) and MYRRHA (mo yao) 
All three substances have similar actions in that they pro-
mote movement when the blood has stagnated, stop pain, 
generate flesh, and assist in the healing of sores. However, 
while Daemonoropis Resina (xue jie) only enters the blood 
level, it is most able to generate flesh, help sores heal, and 
stop bleeding. Olibanum (ru xiiing) and Myrrha (mo yao) 
enter both the qi and blood levels, and are better at trans-
forming stasis, reducing swelling, and stopping pain. The 
latter two substances are therefore most appropriate for qi 
and blood stagnation in the chest and abdomen, pain in the 
joints due to wind-damp painful obstruction, and painful 
swollen sores. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Whenever those with bleeding disorders do not have 
[blood] stasis accumulation, it is unnecessary to use." 
(Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Mat-
eria Medica) 
Toxicity 
Overdosage must be avoided. Allergic reactions have been 
reported, both to ingestion and to exposure to the pow-
dered substance. Symptoms include generalized pruritus, 
skin wheals and eruptions, and angioneurotic edema of the 
hands and feet. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "expended blood" 
Li Shi-Zhen noted that "This substance resembles dried 
blood, hence the name expended blood." 
This is a resinous secretion of the fruit of Daemonorops 
draco Or related species (see ALTERNATE SPECIES & LOCAL 
VARIANTS), which is both cultivated and wild-crafted. The 
prepared substance is imported into China from Southeast 
Asia. The mature fruit is collected and dried thoroughly, 
then placed in a basket with rough sea shells. The basket 
is strongly shaken so that the friable, dried, red resinous 
secretions fall off. All extraneous matter is sifted out, and 
the remaining resinous material wrapped in a cloth bag 
and boiled until it melts and takes the shape of the bag. It 
is removed and cooled, and often stamped with a gold-col-
ored identifying mark. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality has a blackish red, iron-like color; the pow-
dered drug is blood red. When burned, it gives off a smoke 
that irritates the nose.
