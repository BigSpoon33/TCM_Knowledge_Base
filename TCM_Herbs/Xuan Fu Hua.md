## 📖 Overview

*Inulae Flos* (*xuan fu hua*) is bitter, acrid, salty, and slightly warm. Its saltiness softens hard phlegm, its bitterness directs qi downward and promotes the movement of pathogenic water, and its acrid flavor and warmth open up areas of stagnation. Thus it directs rebellious qi downward, disperses phlegm, transforms thin mucus and dispels epigastric obstruction, harmonizes the Stomach and alleviates nausea, and drains the Lungs. Its main indications are cough and dyspnea with profuse phlegm; epigastric fullness, nausea, and belching resulting from the disordered ascent and descent of qi, which allows pathogenic fluids to accumulate in the epigastric region.

Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians notes that this herb has the ability to "disperse clumped phlegm above the diaphragm, phlegm which when expectorated has the appearance of glue or lacquer, and phlegm-water in the costal and cardiac region."

Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica confirms that it is the herb to disperse phlegm, expel water, and carry qi downward! Phlegm-heat, phlegm-dampness, cold phlegm, phlegm from food stagnation, thin mucus and phlegm—any of these disorders will respond well to *Inulae Flos* (*xuan fu hua*); with excess or deficiency, heat or cold, if used in the appropriate combinations, it will never fail to get good results.

Materia Medica of Combinations explains that the herb directs lurking thin mucus in the Heart and Spleen downward, expels chills and fever related to the yin organs, and dispels fullness of qi below the flanks. It breaks up thick, lacquer-like phlegm around the diaphragm, alleviates nausea, and calms palpitations with anxiety from phlegm.

Mechanisms of Selected Combinations

* WITH *PUMEX/COSTAZIAE Os* (*fu hai shi*)
    Both herbs are salty, which enables them to transform viscous sputum to clear the Lungs. However, *Pumex* (*fu hai shi*) is cold, so it benefits greatly from the acrid, warm, Lung qi-disseminating properties of *Inulae Flos* (*xuan fu hua*). At the same time, *Inulae Flos* (*xuan fu hua*) gains from the cooling action of *Pumex/Costaziae Os* (*fu hai shi*) to direct fire downward. This combination is best used for phlegm-heat cough with viscous, difficult-to-expectorate sputum and sensations of tightness and discomfort in the chest.

    * With *Haematitum* (*dai zhe shi*) and *Ginseng Radix* (*ren shen*) for vomiting and hiccough, or even nonstop belching, due to cold from deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach along with internal obstruction of turbid phlegm, as in Inula and Hematite Decoction (*xuan fu dai zhe tang*).
    * With *Coptidis Rhizoma* (*huang lian*) and *Bambusae Caulis in Taeniam* (*zhu ru*) for vomiting due to Stomach heat.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Inappropriate for dry cough due to yin deficiency or for debilitated patients with loose stools.

A mobilizing, dispersing herb. If a patient tends to be deficient, they should not take it excessively. It is forbidden in those with cold affecting the Large Intestine or patients with cold from deficiency—it has thin filaments which may irritate the Lungs and cause coughing, so a cloth [bag] must be used to enclose it properly before decocting. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)

Do not improperly use it for any yin deficient cough, or cough due to consumption, as it will certainly worsen the cough in these cases. (Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica)
