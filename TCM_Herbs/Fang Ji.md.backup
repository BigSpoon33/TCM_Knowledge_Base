## 📖 Overview

Several commentators on the materia medica tradition have described the differences in usage of these two herbs. In *Omissions from the [Classic of the] Materia Medica*, Chen Cang-Qi states that "Stephaniae tetrandrae Radix (*han fang ji*) governs water *qi* while Cocculi Radix (*mu fang ji*) governs wind *qi* as it disseminates and unblocks." Similarly, Huang Yuan-Yu notes in *Changsha Explanation of Medicines* that Stephaniae tetrandrae Radix (*han fang ji*) drains damp excess from the channels and collaterals while Cocculi Radix (*mu fang ji*) drains water pathogen from the organs. This clear differentiation was somewhat disputed by Zhang Shan-Lei in *Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica*, where he says that these two herbs are actually rather close in their usage.
