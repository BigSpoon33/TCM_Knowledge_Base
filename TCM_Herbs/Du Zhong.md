## üìñ Overview

Eucommiae Cortex (du zhong) is best at tonifying the Liver and Kidneys, strengthening the bones and sinews, and quieting the fetus. It enters the qi level of the Liver and the Kidneys, restoring resilience to the bones and sinews with its moist, warm sweetness. It is warming without being overly drying, and while its actions tend to move downward to the lower burner, this is not excessive. One Hundred Annotations to the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica observes:

Eucommiae Cortex (du zhong) is the bark [lit. 'skin'] of wood, and of all bark, this is the most thick yet resilient. Thus it can tonify the human skin. In its midst are silken threads which connect without breaking: the image of sinews, thus it can reconnect the sinews and bones.

The Grand Materia Medica says that it was solely known to enrich the Kidneys in the ancient prescriptions, until Wang Hao-Gu said that it is an herb of the Liver channel qi level, moistening Liver dryness, tonifying Liver deficiency, thus making known what the ancients had not previously disclosed. Overall, the Liver governs the sinews, the Kidneys govern the bones. When the Kidneys are full the bones are strong, when the Liver is full the sinews are strong, and stretching and bending are easy. All of this is due to the sinews.

Essentials of the Materia Medica continues, describing the herb's benefits to the Liver:

Its sweet warmth tonifies, its slightly acrid flavor moistens, being purple in color, it enters the qi level of the Liver channel to moisten Liver dryness and tonify Liver deficiency. The child makes the mother full, so it also tonifies the Kidneys.

The Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica states that it "Governs pain in the lower back and spine, tonifies the middle, augments the essential qi, fortifies the sinews and bones, and strengthens the resolve; expels damp itching in the genitals and terminal dribbling of urination." Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica explains the last part of this passage:

Strengthening the resolve occurs because the Kidneys store the resolve. [It] augments the Kidneys. It expels itching dampness in the lower body and [halts] terminal dribbling of urine because it expels damp-heat in Kidney patients. By augmenting the Kidneys and tonifying the Liver, the essence and blood are naturally sufficient, thus it 'tonifies the middle' - the Liver and Kidneys are in the lower [burner], being the yin organs; if the yin is sufficient, then the middle will also be tonified.

This herb is commonly used, especially in its charred form, for threatened miscarriage, or if there is bleeding during pregnancy. Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica notes that "For those with cold from deficiency in the Kidney channel, this can definitely be used to warmly tonify and secure the fetal base."
