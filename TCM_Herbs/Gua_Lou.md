6 I Herbs that Transform Phlegm and Stop Coughing 
383 
Traditional Contraindications 
According to some traditional sources, this herb is incom-
patible with Aconiti Radix preparata (zhi chuiin wu) and 
other aconite medicinals. It is ineffective for coughs due to 
phlegm secondary to cold-dampness. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "shell mother from ZheUiang]" 
Because Fritillariae thunbergii Bulbus (zhe bei mu) is larger 
in size than Fritillariae cirrhosae Bulbus (chuiin bei mu), it 
is often known as big fritillaria ( :k. ~ ~ da bei mu). 
At the present time, Fritillariae thunbergii Bulbus (zhe 
bei mu) is generally prescribed in its unprepared form. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of dry, white, powdery, solid bulbs 
without areas ofloose texture.

Alternate species & local variants 
Fritillaria thunbergii var. chekiangensis "Eastern fritillaria"('*- ~ 
dong bei) - Zhejiang. Because of its similar size and shape, this 
was originally used as a variant of Fritillariae cirrhosae Bulbus 
(chuan bei mii) in southern China. Today it is thought to belong to 
Fritillaria thunbergii Bulbus, and is an adulterant of Fritillariae cir-
rhosae Bulbus.

Additional product information 
Two different products can be distinguished. The first is the large 
type ( :k ~ da bei), also called ingot type ( n. W ~ yuan bao bei), 
and has bulbs larger than 3.5cm in diameter, which usually disin-
tegrate into scale leaves; the central bud is removed and only the 
outer scale leaves are used. The second is the pearl type (Ji. ~ 
zhQ bei), which is smaller and comprised of complete bulbs with 
central buds. 
To prepare the sliced product, known as ;.llf ~ 14 zhe bei pian , in 
recent years the central buds have been removed, regardless of 
size, and the remaining outer scale leaves are cut into slices. 
While traditionally the large type was considered to be of higher 
quality, some modern texts state that the pearl type has a higher 
therapeutic value.

6 I Herbs that Transform Phlegm and Stop Coughing 
Actions & Indications 
• Clears heat and transforms phlegm-heat: for heat-induced 
coughs with sputum that is thick and difficult to expecto-
rate. Can be used as a stand-alone herb, especially in chil-
dren. 
-
With Meretricis/Cyclinae Concha (ge qiiw) for cough 
with thick yellow sputum and a stifling sensation in the 
chest due to phlegm-heat with constrained clumping of qi. 
-
With Fritillariae thunbergii Bulbus (zhe bei mu), Platy-
cadi Radix (jie geng), and Citri reticulatae Pericarpium 
(chen pf) for wind-heat induced dry cough where the throat 
is dry and there is thick, viscous sputum that is difficult to 
expectorate. 
• Unbinds the chest and dissipates nodules: for conditions 
in which qi accumulates in the chest leading to a stifling or 
distended sensation, constriction, pain, or pressure in the 
diaphragm. 
-
With Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhl bim xia) and 
Coptidis Rhizoma (huang lidn) for focal distention in 
the chest and abdomen that is painful when pressed, and 
coughing of yellow, viscous sputum from phlegm and heat 
clumped together below the Heart, as in Minor Sinking 
into the Chest Decoction (xiao xian xiong tang). 
-
With Allii macrostemi Bulbus (xie bdi) and Pinelliae 
Rhizoma preparatum (zhl ban xia) for painful obstruction 
of the chest due to cold turbidity stagnating in the upper 
burner, as in Trichosanthes Fruit, Chinese Garlic, and 
Pinellia Decoction (gua lou xle bdi ban xia tang). 
• Reduces abscesses and dissipates nodules: primarily for 
abscesses involving the Lungs, Intestines, or breast. 
-
With Myrrha (mo yao) and Olibanum (ru xiang) for 
Lung abscess marked by irritability, stifling sensation in the 
chest, and coughing up pus and blood. 
-
With Lonicerae Flos (jin yin hua), Forsythiae Fructus 
(lidn qiao), and Astragali Radix (huang qf) for Intestinal 
abscess where the pus has already formed, or in patients 
with qi and blood deficiency, as in Expel Pus Powder (pdi 
n6ng san). 
-
With Taraxaci Herba (pu gong ylng) and Olibanum (ru 
xiang) for the early stages of breast abscess. 
Commentary 
When the actions of its various plant parts are considered, 
Trichosanthis Fructus (gua lou) is a very versatile herb. In 
general, Trichosanthis Fructus (gua lou) is best for lead-
ing turbid phlegm downward. While it cools Lung and 
Stomach heat in the upper burner to scour phlegm and 
reduce stagnation, it can also ease the middle burner and 
direct qi downward in order to unbind the chest and dis-
perse clumping. Moreover, it moistens the Large Intestine 
to assist the movement of stool through the lower burner. 
This action is most suitable for the wheezing and consti-
pation associated with phlegm-heat accumulating in the 
Lungs, accompanied by heat drying and then obstructing 
the Intestines. 
Records of Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica 
notes that "The most useful aspect ofTrichosanthis Fructus 
(qulin gua lou) is that it guides phlegm and turbidity 
downward; thus, clumping in the chest and chest painful 
obstruction cannot be [successfully] treated without it." 
If a lesser yang disorder involves irritability without 
nausea, Discussion of Cold Damage recommends the substi-
tution ofTrichosanthis Fructus (gua lou) fruit for Pinelliae 
Rhizoma preparatum (zhl ban xia) and Ginseng Radix (ren 
shen) in Minor Bupleurum Decoction (xiao chdi hu tang). 
Li Shi-Zhen observed: 
Zhang Zhong-Jing always used Trichosanthis Fructus (gua 
16u) in the treatment of painful obstruction of the chest 
with pain through to the back, coughing of sputum and 
wheezing, as well as stifling fullness and pain in the chest. 
This exploits its sweet coldness, which does not injure 
the Stomach qi, and its ability to direct upper burner fire 
downward, causing the phlegm qi to descend. Cheng Wu-
Ji [author of the earliest extant annotation of Discussion of 
Cold Damage] was ignorant of this intention and therefore 
proclaimed it was "bitter cold to drain heat." This is prob-
ably because he did not taste [it] to find that the herb was 
actually not bitter. Texts which accord with his own show a 
[similar ]lack of understanding. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
;:.;.. WITH MERETRICIS/CYCLINAE CONCHA (ge qiao) 
Both herbs clear heat, transform phlegm, and enter the 
Lung channel. Trichosanthis Fructus (gua lou) is sweet, 
cold, clearing, and moistening, while Meretricis/Cyclinae 
Concha (ge qiao) is bitter, salty, neutral, and best at soften-
ing solid nodules and transforming thick phlegm. Together 
their ability to clear the Lungs and transform phlegm is 
greatly enhanced; their combination also gives them the 
ability to open the chest and disperse clumps. Each herb 
complements the other: they mobilize qi, direct phlegm-
heat downward, release constraint, and eliminate heat. 
This pair is particularly appropriate for the treatment 
of coughing of thick yellow sputum with a stifling sensation 
in the chest due to phlegm-heat with constrained clump-
ing of qi. Zhu Dan-Xi recommended the combination as a 
complete two-herb formula for chest pain due to phlegm 
and thin mucus. 


6 I Herbs that Transform Phlegm and Stop Coughing 
385 
;:;> WITH OLIBANUM (ru xiiing) 
Materia Medica of Diet Therapy notes that sweet, cold 
Trichosanthis Fructus (guii l6u) "encourages lactation, as 
well as treating sores and swellings." Olibanum (ru xiiing) is 
acrid, bitter, and warm. The Grand Materia Medica elabo-
rates: "Olibanum (ru xiiing) is aromatic and expeditious, 
enters the Heart channel, invigorates the blood, arrests 
pain, and is therefore an important herb for the pain of 
abscesses and sores and also pain in the chest and abdo-
men." When used together, because Trichosanthis Fructus 
(guii lou) enters the qi level and Olibanum (ru xiiing) enters 
the blood level, both the qi and blood are invigorated such 
that swellings and clumps are readily dispersed. In the 
absence of blockage, the source of the pain is removed. 
This pair is very commonly used in the treatment of 
puerperal breast disorders with accumulation, stagnation, 
distention, and pain such as insufficient lactation from 
obstruction or early-stage breast abscess. In the latter case, 
they will usually be combined with the cooling, toxicity-
resolving Taraxaci Herba (pu gong ylng), which is specific 
to toxic breast disorders owing to its channel attributes. 
:l> WITH PINELLIAE RHIZOMA PREPARATUM (zhl biln xia) 
This pair is excellent for treating focal distention of the 
chest and diaphragm due to clumping of phlegm and heat 
leading to qi constraint, or for painful obstruction of the 
chest due to clumping of sticky, thick, and turbid phlegm. 
Each herb contributes its strengths: Pinelliae Rhizoma pre-
paratum (zhl ban xia) its ability to transform phlegm and 
dissolve focal distention and clumps, and Trichosanthis 
Fructus (guii l6u) its ability to cool the transformation of 
phlegm and to ease the chest and disperse clumps. 
Comparisons 
:l> Vs. SINAPIS SEMEN (bciijie zi) 
Both herbs facilitate the flow of qi in the chest and scour 
phlegm, and both can be used if turbid phlegm obstructs 
the qi, causing pain and a stifling sensation in the chest. 
However, the two herbs are diametrically opposed in terms 
of their temperature qualities. Trichosanthis Fructus (guii 
16u) is moist and cold, and is more appropriate for condi-
tions in which heat and phlegm have clumped together in 
the chest. By contrast, Sinapis Semen (bcii jie zi) is warm, 
drying, and powerful in nature, and is thus more appropri-
ate for cold-phlegm accumulating in the chest. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Should not be given if there is Stomach cold with loose 
bowels, Stomach deficiency with reduced intake of food, or 
Spleen deficiency with diarrhea." (Harm and Benefit in the 
Materia Medica) 
Zhang Jie-Bin pointed out that the statement in the 
Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica regard-
ing the ability of Trichosanthis Fructus (guii 16u) to tonify 
the Lungs was a great mistake. Chen Shi-Duo went further, 
saying that while Trichosanthis Fructus (guii l6u) is the best 
herb for directing downward and scouring out filth, still 
it should definitely not be used in large doses, and only if 
accumulated filth has obstructed the flow of qi and formed 
clumping in the upper burner which refuses to descend 
should it be used to clear away the accumulation. Otherwise 
it should certainly not be used, because it very readily 
injures one's true qi. For clumping in the chest due to cold 
damage, it is only used because there is no other choice-
without the clumping, how could one use it lightly? As for 
dispersing phlegm, alleviating thirst, and encouraging lacta-
tion, it may only be used in small amounts: large amounts 
are totally contraindicated. Those who say it can treat defi-
ciency and eliminate cough from consumption are giving 
deadly advice which should not be trusted. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
This herb is commonly referred to as whole trichosanthes 
fruit ( ~ 
Ji\ .f quan giia l6u) because it includes the entire 
fruit: peel, kernels, and flesh. (Another common way of 
specifying that the entire fruit is desired is to write Ji:\. i 
t' giia l6u shi). The early materia medica texts explain the 
name by stating that the round fruit are called Ji:\. giia and 
the long fruit ll6u. 
While originally the whole fruit was always used, over 
time the different actions associated with various parts led 
to a distinction among the whole fruit, peel, and seeds. 
When a prescription calls for Trichosanthis Fructus ( qudn 
guii l6u) -
the whole fruit -
and it is unavailable, usu-
ally one-third peel and two-thirds seeds will be dispensed, 
although one-half of each is also acceptable. 
Because the best quality is ripe, orange-yellow, and 
plump, a request for the best product is specified by such 
names as yellow mature trichonsanthes (-;:;, ~-!\ Jr\. .i huang 
shu giia l6u) or yellow plump trichonsanthes (-;:;,~E. A:\. .i 
huangfei gua 16u). 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of large, unfragmented fruit with a 
wrinkled, orange surface.
