10 I Herbs that Regulate the Blood 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Cannot be consumed during pregnancy." (Essentials of 
Materia Medica Distinctions) 
Should not be used when joint pain or chest, abdomen, 
hypochondrium, and flank pain are not due to retained 
blood stasis, but rather to blood deficiency. It should not be 
used for excessive loss of postpartum lochia with abdomi-
nal pain due to deficiency. It should not be used when 
sores have already perforated. (Commentary on the Divine 
Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica) 
This warning may seem unusual for a substance that 
"assists the growth of flesh." See the note to TRADITIONAL 
CoNTRAINDICATIONS under the entry for Olibanum (ru 
xiang) above. 
Toxicity 
Ingestion of this substance can cause allergic reactions, 
usually affecting the skin. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
This is a fragrant oleo-gum resin from East Africa and 
Arabia. If well-cleaned of extraneous material, with amber-
like transparency, it is called bright myrrh (El,ij ).i ~ ming 
mo yao) or clean myrrh ()1>-).i ~ jlng rna yao). Because his-
torically it has been imported and is expensive, adulterants 
and substitutes are not unknown, and the term true myrrh 
( Jt & ~ zhen mo yao) reflects this. 
Unprepared myrrh ( .1. ).i~ sheng mo yao) is generally 
used externally or in pill form, as it has a tendency to irri-
tate the stomach and cause nausea. In pill form, it is usually 
prepared with either rice paste or honey, both of which act 
as buffers. In addition, pills dissolve slowly and therefore 
have less impact than does a decoction. Prepared myrrh is 
preferred for use in decoctions and internal powders. 
}> PREPARED MYRRH(~ &_~ zhl mo yao) 
Clean myrrh is dry-fried at a medium temperature until it 
starts to smoke and melt. It is then sprayed with rice vin-
egar, while still stirring and frying, until the surface appears 
oily and glistening. It is then quickly removed from the wok 
and spread out to cool. This is also known as vinegar myrrh 
(i!ilb.i ~ cit mo yao). 
This method of preparation reduces its disagreeable 
effects on the digestion and improves its taste. It also 
strengthens its ability to invigorate the blood, stop pain, 
restrain and inhibit, and generate flesh. It is easier to pul-
verize. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of yellowish brown, broken, slightly 
translucent, oily pieces with an intense aroma and bitter 
taste, and without such foreign matter as sand and the 
like. 
Major known chemical constituents 
Resins (25-35%): a-commiphoric acid, 8-commiphoric acid, y-com-
miphoric acid, commiphorinic acid, heerabomyrrhol, a-heerabomyr-
rholic acid, 8-heerabomyrrholic acid, heeraboresene, commiferin 
Volatile oil: eugenol, m-cresol, cuminaldehyde, pinene, limonene, 
cinnamic aldehyde, heerabolene, 8a-methoxyfuranodiene, 8a-
acetylfuranodiene, isofuranogermacrene (curzerene), lindestrene, 
furanoeudesma-1,3-diene, furanodiene 
Other constituents: balsams (57-65%) composed of arabinose, 
galactose, and xylose 
Adulterants 
Sand or clay are sometimes added to the product to increase its 
weight, and therefore its price. 
Alternate names 
a,q ;g_ ~ ming mo yao

Additional product information 
Two different products can be distinguished: natural myrrh ( *-. tf; 
i9.. ~ tian ran mo yao) from Commiphora myrrha, and gelatinous 
myrrh (~ ~ 
i9..~ jiao zhi mo yao) from Balsamodendron ehrenber-
gianum. There is no significant difference in quality between the 
two.

Commentary 
Depending on its method of preparation, Achyranthis 
bidentatae Radix (niu xl) has very different properties. In 
its unprepared form, it breaks up blood, unblocks men-
struation, and guides the blood downward, treating such 
symptoms as amenorrhea due to blood stasis, mobile and 
fixed abdominal masses, postpartum abdominal pain due 
to blood stagnation, difficult labor, retained placenta, 
swelling and pain from external injury, and pain in the 
joints from painful obstruction. It leads blood downward, 
which also has the effect of directing downward fire that is 
blazing upward and causing nosebleed, sore throat, and 
swollen, bleeding gums. However, the unprepared form 
also has a downward-slipping tendency that can aggra-
vate spermatorrhea, vaginal discharge, and diarrhea; for 
patients with these problems, the herb should either be 
used in its prepared form, or not at all. 
In its prepared form, the herb tonifies the Liver and 
Kidneys, strengthens the sinews and bones, and is used 
for aching weakness of the lower back and knees, and lack 
of strength in the sinews and bones. The Grand Materia 
Medica states that it "is a herb of the leg terminal yin and 


640 
10 I Herbs that Regulate the Blood 
[leg] lesser yin channels. When prepared with wine, it 
primarily tonifies the Liver and Kidneys; when used unpre-
pared, it expels noxious blood." 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
)» WITH REHMANNIAE RADIX (sheng dl huang) 
Rehmanniae Radix (sheng dl huang) cools the blood, nour-
ishes the yin, and generates fluids; Achyranthis bidentatae 
Radix (niu xf) guides blood to descend and directs patho-
genic fire downward. The qualities of the two herbs mutu-
ally complement to powerfully clear fire from deficiency 
that is blazing upward causing such symptoms as pain 
and swelling of the gums, nosebleed, vomiting of blood, 
and other bleeding in the upper body. Rehmanniae Radix 
(sheng dl huang) ensures that the yin is sufficient to control 
fire, treating the root, while Achyranthis bidentatae Radix 
( niu xf) directs downward, treating the branch by prevent-
ing the upward rush of blood. The combination has also 
been used in the treatment of diabetes: the two herbs are 
powdered, then made into pills which should be taken for 
an extended period of time for best results. 
Comparisons 
)» Vs. CuRCUMA£ LONGAE RHrzoMA (jiiing huang) 
Both herbs break up blood, drive blood downward, unblock 
menstruation, stop pain, and affect the sinews. Curcumae 
longae Rhizoma (jiiing huang) more powerfully breaks 
up blood, but also promotes the movement of qi, and 
affects the sinews by expelling wind painful obstruction. 
Achyranthis bidentatae Radix (niu xf) strengthens sinews 
and bones by tonifying the Liver and Kidneys, which 
Curcumae longae Rhizoma (jiiing huang) does not do. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"If amenorrhea is only short term, and pregnancy is 
suspected, do not use it. Do not add it to upper burner 
herbs. It is forbidden where there is continuous bleed-
ing." (Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of 
Materia Medica) 
"If there is diarrhea, dysenteric disorder, or Spleen defi-
ciency, with soreness and pain in the legs and knees, it 
should not be used." (Transforming the Significance of 
Medicinal Substances) This is because it directs downward, 
thus opposing the ascent of Spleen qi, so even if knee pain 
would seem to indicate its use, it is forbidden. Materia 
Medica of Combinations concurs: "It is forbidden for both 
insufficiency of middle burner qi and incontinence of

Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "ox knee" 
The term ox knee ( 4- ~ niu xf) refers to the leaf nodes on 
the stem of the plant, which resemble the knees of an ox. 
There are two major species used as this herb, which have 
similar actions, but also differences that have long been 
described in the traditional literature. The product of the 
Huai river basin in Henan is Achryranthes bidentata Oft 
4- ~ huai niu xf), which has been considered superior in 
quality since it was first cultivated in this area in the tenth 
century. The other major species is Cyathula officina/is 
(1114-~ chuiin niu xf), which is both cultivated and wild-
crafted (see following ADDENDUM, and photo on page 
1153). for other species, see ALTERNATE SPECIES & LOCAL 
VARIANTS below. 
)» DRY-FRIED ACHYRANTHES (:J:)-·4-~ chao niu Xf) 
The sliced herb is dry-fried until it swells. This method of 
preparation eliminates the slippery, downward-draining 
problem associated with unprepared achyranthes, and 
enhances its ability to tonify the Liver and Kidneys. 
)» SALT-FRIED ACHYRANTHES (~ 
:J:;J;4-~ yan chao niu xf) 
The sliced herb is soaked in a mixture of water and table 
salt, set aside briefly to absorb the mixture, then dry-fried 
until dry. This has the effect of guiding the herb directly 
into the Kidney channel to tonify the Kidneys and nourish 
the sinews and bones. It is often used for lower backache 
and leg atrophy due to Kidney deficiency and exhaustion 
of essence. 
)» WrNE-FRIED AcHYRANTHEs (ii!li 4-~ jiu niu xf) 
The herb is mixed with yellow rice wine, left covered briefly 
to absorb the mixture, then dry-fried until dry. It can also 
be dry-fried in bran that has been soaked in wine. This 
method exploits the acrid-dispersing quality of the wine to 
enhance the herb's ability to invigorate the blood, unblock 
the collaterals, stop pain, and unblock menstruation, and 
is thus used to treat disorders such as mobile and fixed 
abdominal masses, difficult labor, and retained placenta. 
)» CHARRED ACHYRANTHES ( 4- ~-0£ niu XI tim) 
The herb is placed in the wok with a small amount of wine 
and water, then dry-fried until the surface is scorched and 
the interior is dark yellow. This is often used to treat fire 
from deficiency blazing upward to cause such disorders as 
bleeding gums, toothache, and nosebleed. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of dry, fleshy, long roots with thin 
cork, a yellowish grey surface, and sweet taste. The crown 
should be cut off.
