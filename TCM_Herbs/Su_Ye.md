CAUTIONS & CONTRAINDICATIONS 
Contraindicated in those 
with warm pathogen diseases, or with qi and exterior defi-
ciency. 
Actions & Indications 
• Releases the exterior and disperses cold: for externally-
contracted wind-cold with such symptoms as fever, chills, 
headache, nasal congestion, cough, or a stifling sensation 
in the chest, as in Apricot Kernel and Perilla Leaf Powder 
(xlng susan) and Cyperus and Perilla Leaf Powder (xiiing 
susan). 
-
With Cyperi Rhizoma (xiiing fu) to release the exterior 
in a patient with pre-existing qi constraint. Add Ephedrae 
Herba ( mti huang) if the cold is severe. 
-
With Platycodi Radix (jie geng) for common colds 
with such symptoms as nasal congestion and productive 
cough. The addition of Armeniacae Semen (xlng ren) and 
Peucedani Radix (qitin hu) strengthens its effect in treating 
cough. 
-
With Codonopsis Radix (dang shen) to benefit the qi 
and release the exterior in patients who are weak or debili-
tated. 
-
With Raphani Semen (ltii fU zi) and Armeniacae Semen 
(xlng ren) to disperse phlegm and alleviate wheezing. 
-
With Chaenomelis Fructus (mit guii) and Magnoliae 
officinalis Cortex (hOu po) to disperse heat and relieve sum-
merheat. 
• Promotes the movement of qi and expands the chest: 
for nausea, vomiting, or poor appetite, as in Patchouli/ 
Agastache Powder to Rectify the Qi (huo xiiing zheng 
ql san). Also used as an auxillary herb to invigorate the 
blood. 
-
With Pogostemonis/Agastaches Herba (huo xiiing) to 
release the exterior, regulate the qi, warm the middle 
burner, and transform turbidity. Used in cases of influenza 
and the common cold caused by wind-cold-dampness. 
Especially effective for the associated symptoms of abdom-
inal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Linderae Radix (wu yao) 
is often added. 
-
With Platycodi Radix (jie geng) and Aurantii Fructus 
(zhl ke) to ease the diaphragm and Intestines. 
-
With Chuanxiong Rhizoma ( chuiin xiong) and Angelicae 
sinensis Radix (dang guf) to harmonize the blood and dis-
perse blood stasis. 
• Use during pregnancy: for calming a restless fetus, or for 
morning sickness. 
-
With Amomi Fructus (shii ren) and Citri reticulatae 
Pericarpium (chen pf) for restless fetus caused by stagnant 
qi. Also for a stifling sensation and fullness in the chest and 
abdomen. 
-
With Coptidis Rhizoma (huang litin) for morning sick-
ness and irritability during pregnancy, or whenever middle 
burner stagnation tends toward heat. 
• Resolves seafood poisoning: used either alone or with other 
herbs. 
-
With Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jiiing) for sea-
food poisoning or for exterior conditions. 
Commentary 
"Its acrid flavor enters the qi level, while its purple color 
signals that it enters the blood level." These are the open-


1 I Herbs that Release the Exterior 
13 
ing words from the discussion of Perillae Folium (z! su ye) 
in Essentials of the Materia Medica. Further description is 
found in Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica: "[I]ts 
aroma can vent wind outward, its warmth can warm the 
middle, facilitating the comfort of the whole body. Thus, 
it is named revivify(.~ su}." Materia Medica of Food Stuffs 
adds that it can "bring down floating qi in the chest and 
diaphragm." 
Most classical texts warn, however, that continued 
consumption will drain away true qi (see CAUTIONS & 
CoNTRAINDICATIONS above). The same caveat applies to 
all acrid, dispersing herbs. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
> WITH CYPERI RHIZOMA (xiiingfu) 
This two-herb combination is excellent for treating exte-
rior wind-cold where there is pre-existing qi constraint. 
This will present with exterior symptoms such as chills 
and fever, headache, and lack of sweating, with concurrent 
symptoms of qi stagnation such as stuffy chest, burping, 
and flatulence. This combination can be used alone or as 
part of a larger formula such as Cyperus and Perilla Leaf 
Powder (xiiing su scm), but the choice of which herb shall 
serve as chief depends upon which symptoms are primary. 
Perillae Folium (zi su ye) releases the exterior, but also 
has the ability to move middle burner qi. The addition of 
the acrid, mobilizing quality of Cyperi Rhizoma (xiiing 
fu) assures that the congealing cold which is blocking the 
protective qi is released, and that the pathogen will thereby 
be dispersed via the exterior. Cyperi Rhizoma (xiiing fu), 
however, contributes more than just facilitating qi move-
ment; it also moves the qi at the blood level. When one 
considers that the locus of disruption in an invasion of the 
exterior is the disharmony between the protective and the 
nutritive qi, and that the latter is intimately associated with 
blood, the elegance of this apparently simple combination 
becomes apparent. 
> WITH ZINGIBERIS RHIZOMA RECENS (shengjiiing) 
Both herbs release the exterior and can induce sweating. 
The acrid, warm nature of Perillae Folium (zi su ye) dis-
perses, with a light qi that unblocks and a light flavor that 
can drain. In this way it disperses exterior pathogens while 
clearing the head and eyes, drains the Lung qi and unblocks 
the interstices and pores, thereby treating invasion of either 
wind or cold. 
Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jiiing) is acrid and 
warm. While it can disperse exterior wind-cold, its sweat-
inducing action is rather weak by itself; combined with 
Perillae Folium (zi su ye), it is much stronger. 
This combination is very effective in treating wind-cold 
exterior patterns with symptoms of chills, fever, headache, 
nasal congestion, and, most importantly, the absence of 
sweating. 
Interestingly, both Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng 
jiiing) and Perillae Folium (z! su ye) can be used indi-
vidually as an antidote to seafood poisoning; together, this 
effect is increased. The pair is therefore often used for the 
vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea that results from 
this kind of food poisoning. 
> WITH PoGOSTEMONIS HERBA (gwing huo xiiing}; see 
page 478 
Comparisons 
> Vs. EPHEDRAE HERBA (rna huang) 
While Perillae Folium (z! su ye) is acrid and can disperse 
while inducing sweating, it is not as strong as Ephedrae 
Herba (rna huang) in this regard. Yet its aroma promotes 
the movement of Lung and Spleen qi, harmonizes the 
middle, and calms the fetus, qualities which are lacking in 
Ephedrae Herba (rna huang). 
Traditional Contraindications 
In Extension of the Materia Medica, Kou Zong-Shi observed 
that 
Nowadays people drink perilla soup morning and night, 
but it is not good for them, just as the old medical saying 
has it that 'aromatic plants cause diseases which steal away 
riches' - this is one such case. For example, in people with 
Spleen and Stomach cold, it often causes runny diarrhea 
without their realizing it. 
In the centuries since this was written, most materia medica 
texts repeated or paraphrased this passage in their discus-
sion of Perillae Folium (zi su ye). Chen Shi-Duo, in New 
Compilation of Materia Medica, was the first to question 
whether this herb necessarily causes diarrhea in those with 
Spleen and Stomach cold: 
[Kou] Zong-Shi has a saying that 'people with Spleen and 
Stomach cold who consume Perillae Folium (z[ su ye) usu-
ally have diarrhea.' But do they really? I say: Perillae Folium 
(z[ su ye) is a wind herb, good at calming the Liver. If earth 
is [excessively] controlled by wood then people will often 
have diarrhea, but once wood is calmed, then earth will 
obtain the nourishment it needs. It goes without saying that 
Perillae Folium (zi su ye) is acrid and warm, acridity can 
expel dampness while warmth can expel cold; so people 
with Spleen and Stomach cold should really not have any 
problem- how could it cause diarrhea? It is only that acrid, 
aromatic flavors are able to disperse a person's true qi. 
Short term this is no problem, but long term it will cause 
injury; this should also be kept in mind.
