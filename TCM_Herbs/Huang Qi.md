## 📖 Overview

Sweet and warm, Astragali Radix (huang qi) enters the Spleen and Lung channels to tonify the middle burner qi while also raising the yang qi to reach the muscle layer and exterior, stabilizing the protective yang so that it alleviates abnormal sweating due to protective yang qi deficiency. Because it strongly tonifies the primal qi, it generates blood and fluids, and encourages the normal qi to promote the discharge of pus and generate regrowth of flesh. Its warmth reinforces yang transport and transformation, enabling fluid metabolism to function normally, thereby facilitating urination and reducing edema. With its strong ascending nature, it raises prolapse and alleviates uncomfortable sensations of dragging downward. It can also stop bleeding.

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica states that it augments earth in the middle burner, warmly nourishing the Spleen and Stomach. It is most appropriate when the middle burner qi is sluggish, the Spleen earth is deficient and weak, and the clear qi sinks downward. Its bark reaches directly to the exterior skin and muscle, securing the protective yang and amply filling the exterior level. These are its specific strengths, so it is really marvelous for all disorders involving exterior deficiency.

The therapeutic effects of this herb vary depending upon whether it is used in its prepared or unprepared form. Unprepared, it tends to travel in the exterior level, where it stabilizes the protective qi to stop sweating, eliminates edema, and brings sores and boils to a head in order to allow the discharge of pus. In its prepared form, it tends to travel internally, where it tonifies the qi and raises the yang.

Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica notes that it "is an herb that tonifies the Lungs, strengthens the Spleen, supports the protective qi to inhibit sweating, drives out wind, and transports toxicity [out of the body]."

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia According to Medica, this herb embodies springtime's imperative to rise and expand; it is sweet and warm, and yellow in color, all of those qualities which incorporate the correct harmony of the middle. This is why it can tonify and augment the middle earth, warming and nourishing the Spleen and Stomach. It is most appropriate whenever the middle qi cannot ascend, the Spleen earth is deficient and weak, and the clear qi sinks downward.

Mechanisms of Selected Combinations

* WITH GINSENG RADIX (ren shen)
When these two strong qi tonics are combined, each complements the other, Astragali Radix (huang qi) contributing its quick, ascending quality, which particularly strengthens the exterior, while Ginseng Radix (ren shen) prolongs the action, supporting the deeper areas of the body, and also nourishing and protecting the yin. There is thus a broad range of actions for this combination: if the Lung protective qi is deficient, it tonifies the qi to secure the protective; if the Spleen and Stomach qi is weak, it can stimulate and raise the middle burner qi; if the Heart qi is deficient, it tonifies the Heart and unblocks the vessels. In fact, this combination can be used for any pattern of qi deficiency, and while it often achieves good results on its own, it provides the foundation for a long list of formulas, among them Tonify the Middle and Augment the Qi Decoction (bu zhong yi qi tang), All-Inclusive Great Tonifying Decoction (shi quan da bu tang), Lift the Source Decoction (ju yuan jian), and Sage-like Healing Decoction (sheng yu tang), to name just a few. The same things can be said about the combination of Astragali Radix (huang qi) and Codonopsis Radix (dang shen).

* WITH CIMICIFUGAE RHIZOMA (sheng ma)
In this combination, Astragali Radix (huang qi) augments and raises the primal qi of the Spleen, assisted by Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng ma). About this herb, Zhang Yuan Su notes that "Herbs that tonify the Spleen and Stomach will be ineffective without Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng ma) to guide their use." After middle age the Spleen qi tends to sink, and the use of herbs that raise up becomes essential. Li Shi-Zhen points out:

> In general, for people over fifty years of age, their qi is being dissipated more, and generated less; more qi is descending and less is rising. The nature of autumn in their lives predominates, rather than springtime. Those whose constitution is weak and whose primal qi is sinking would benefit from Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng ma) used adroitly in their treatment.

When these two herbs are used together, the clear yang qi of the Spleen will ascend, which allows the turbid yin qi to descend and thereby be eliminated from the body. If the Spleen yang is unable to ascend, but sinks instead, this will lead to such disorders as chronic diarrhea, dragging sensations in the abdomen, fatigue, shortness of breath, uterine bleeding, and prolapses. This combination is effective for all of these disorders.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Inappropriate for the early stages of sores or when there is significant heat toxin present after sores have ulcerated. [Astragali Radix (huang qi)] should not be used for pathogenic excess in the exterior ... it tonifies the yang, so if yang is overabundant and yin is deficient, or upper burner heat is excessive and lower burner deficient and cold, it should not be used. The concern is that it will raise qi to the exterior, leaving the interior even more deficient. It is also contraindicated for pox and sores due to blood level heat.
