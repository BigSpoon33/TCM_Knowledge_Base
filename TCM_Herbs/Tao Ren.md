  # Clinical Information
  dosage: "4.5-9g"
  toxicity: "Because of its amygdalin content, this herb is toxic. Over dosage causes toxic side effects. The latent period (2.5-5 hours) and the toxic dose both depend on the botanical species ingested, the type of processing (peeled kernels are less toxic than unpeeled), the method of administration (decoctions are far less toxic than ingestion of the unprepared kernels), as well as the length of time that it is chewed and the pH of the gastric juice. For children under five years of age, 5-10 kernels are sufficient to cause side effects; 20 kernels can be lethal.

The symptoms of toxicity are similar to those of cyanide poisoning: irritation of gastrointestinal mucosa, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, general weakness, blurred vision, tachycardia; tachypnea, slow or irregular respiration, terror, oppressive feeling in the chest; loss of consciousness, incontinence of urine and stool, dilated pupils, absence of pupillary reflexes, severe spasms or cyanosis, coma, and shock. There are also reports of allergic reactions: skin eruptions and pruritus developed at the area of exposition.

To avoid toxicity, overdosage must be strictly avoided. When taken directly (in pills or powders or by themselves), they should be peeled after boiling in water for a short time. This procedure substantially reduces the amygdalin content and thereby significantly reduces its toxicity. Peeling is unnecessary when the herb is used in decoctions."

## üìñ Overview

Bitter, and thus draining, heavy in weight, and thus sinking and downward-directing, and moist in texture, the range of action of Persicae Semen (tao ren) is determined by the channels it enters: Heart, Liver, Lung, and Large Intestine. Its affiliation with the Heart and Liver indicates its action on the blood, but it also moistens the Intestines that are dry to relieve constipation, stops coughs and wheezing, and moistens the skin, all of which relate to the Large Intestine and Lung. While it is generally conceded by most materia medica texts that it is almost wholly attacking in nature- breaking up blood stasis-its status as a fruit kernel implies some life-giving generative force as well. In Persicae Semen (tao ren), this is expressed as the ability to assist in the generation of new blood following the expulsion of old, stagnant blood. In some cases, too, its effect in the treatment of wind painful obstruction is noted; this effect is based on the restoration of normal blood movement, which both eliminates pathogenic wind and begins to supply nourishment to those areas that were damaged by the pathogenic occupation.

The primary action of this herb is on the blood, as indicated in the Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica where it says: "Governs stagnant blood, amenorrhea, mobile and fixed abdominal masses, pathogenic qi, and the killing of small parasites." The term 'pathogenic qi' is glossed by some as referring to abdominal masses, but most other writers agree that it refers to infestatious ( Ë´∏ÁóÖ zhu bing) disease, a wide category of contagious and demonic illness. According to Records of Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica, this is because "the peach tree is the tree of the west, and contains the essence of the Five Trees ... but whether the Classic of Materia Medica is here referring to evil demonic qi when it uses the two characters 'pathogenic qi', there is no way to know."

Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians states that it "Stops coughs and upward rebellious qi, reduces hardness in the area below the Heart, eliminates sudden violent hemorrhage, breaks up mobile and fixed abdominal masses, unblocks vessels and stops pain." Combinations of Materia Medica adds that it "treats blood clumping, blood build-up, blood stagnation, and wind painful obstruction."

Regarding its effects on the Large Intestine, Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances says that it is "moist in texture, it can enrich Intestinal dryness ... entering the Large Intestine, it treats parched blood causing blocked stool, and dry blood causing difficult stool."

The Detailed Materia Medica observes:
Bitter, sweet, and neutral ... it sinks and directs downward: yang within yin ... The bitterness of Persicae Semen (tao ren) drains stagnant blood, and its sweetness generates new blood. It has four uses: to treat heat entering the blood chamber, to drain stagnant blood in the abdomen, to expel blood heat, dryness, and itching in the skin, and to promote the movement of congealed blood stasis in the skin.

Records of Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica explains these references to skin: "Peaches have a fuzzy skin, and are a Lung fruit; the kernels primarily attack stagnant blood, and are a Liver herb-but it also dredges stasis of the skin, interstices, and pores."
