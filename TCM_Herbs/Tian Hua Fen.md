  # Clinical Information
  dosage: "10-15g"
  toxicity: "No toxic side effects are to be expected when using the dried herb. There has been just one reported case of allergic reaction. Trichosanthin, an ingredient of this herb, is a toxic protein. When purified and administered by intra-amniotic or intramuscular injection, it has an abortifacient action in early pregnancy. The protein is destroyed by light, heat, and humidity. Thus, its presence is much reduced by the time the herb is dried, and non-existent after the dried herb is decocted. Trichosanthin should not be injected, as this can lead to the following side effects: elevated temperature, headache, skin rash, sore throat, and stiff neck. There have been a few reported cases of anaphylactic shock, along with one case of brachial artery thrombosis. Some reports discourage the use of injectable trichosanthin in any patient who has received it in the past because of the strong antigenicity of this protein. Other reactions include angioneurotic edema, abnormal ECG or arrhythmia, hypotension, severe epistaxis, profuse bleeding after miscarriage, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal distention, and albuminuria. Trichosanthin should never be used in hypersensitive individuals, or those with heart, liver, or kidney problems. It should be used with caution in persons with hemorrhagic diseases, severe anemia, psychiatric disturbances, and in those with previous exposure to the herb. All of these cautions refer to the use of the purified protein trichosanthin and do not apply to decoctions or other use of the whole herb."

## üìñ Overview

This herb is best for cooling Lung and Stomach heat, and generating Lung and Stomach yin fluids, while also possessing toxicity-resolving and blood-invigorating properties. Because it enters the yang brightness channel, it is often used for wasting and thirsting disease, jaundice, breast abscess, and hemorrhoids. And because it acts at the level of the muscles and flesh, it can also reduce swelling and treat sores.

In *Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica*, Zhang Jie-Bin explains:

By flavor bitter, by nature cold, yet both of these qualities are very mild. It has both raising and downward-directing tendencies, and is therefore yang within yin. It is best for cooling heat in the Lungs, and excels at resolving thirst from heat. It has a powerful ability to direct phlegm-heat above the diaphragm downward, to dispel the swelling and toxins of breast abscess, hemorrhoids and sores, to expel pus, and to generate flesh. It also eliminates stagnant blood due to trauma, unblocks menstrual flow, expels the heat of mania, dispels yellow jaundice, moistens parched dryness, and also excels at resolving alcohol toxicity. Likewise it unblocks the Small Intestine and treats bulging disorder from Liver fire.

Zhang Xi-Chun observes that "Most vine roots can unblock and mobilize channels and collaterals, but Trichosanthis Radix (tian hua fen) also has a cooling, toxicity-resolving nature, which results in its various actions."

If a lesser yang disorder involves thirst but without nausea, *Discussion of Cold Damage* recommends that Trichosanthis Radix (tian hua fen) be substituted for Pinelliae Rhizoma preparata (ban xia) in Minor Bupleurum Decoction (xiao chai hu tang).
