13 I Herbs that Stabilize and Bind 
with bleeding; Stomach fire toothache; damp-heat accu-
mulating into stagnation; early stages of vaginal discharge. 
(Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of 
Materia Medica) 
Astringent herbs should only be used in the later stages of 
vaginal discharge, to avoid preventing the expulsion of the 
pathogenic influence. 
Toxicity 
Unprocessed nutmeg seeds are toxic. Ingestion of about 7g 
of the powdered, unprocessed herb can cause nausea, ver-
tigo, and hallucinations. Higher doses can lead to delirium, 
lethargy, coma, dilated pupils, bradypnea, and even death. 
Roasting removes the toxic ingredients. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "fleshy cardamon" 
Historically, the term Ji ~ dou kou has been widely used 
to refer to several similar aromatic, cardamom-like fruits 
including white dou kou (Amomum kravanh s Ji ~ bdi 
dou kou), herbal dou kou (Alpinia karsumadai 1f. Ji ~ ciio 
dou kou), red dou kou (Alpinia galanga ft.-:r. Ji ~ h6ng dou 
kou), and fleshy dou kou (Myristica fragrans ~ Ji ~ rou 
dou kou). When the term dou kou is used alone, it refers to 
Amomi Fructus rotundus (bdi dou kou). 
Nutmeg seeds are also known as fleshy fruit(~* rou 
guo) or jade fruit ( .£ * yu guo). The fleshy fruit splits in 
half upon ripening, exposing the bright red, fleshy out-
growth of the seed-the aril-within which is a reddish 
brown shell, itself enclosing a single seed. The dried seed 
provides the spice nutmeg and this herb. The net-like aril, 
which surrounds the seed, when dried provides the spice 
mace, called fleshy fruit flower (~*.ft. rou guo hua or .£ 
*.ft. yu guo hua). Nutmeg seeds are usually prepared by 
roasting before use to remove the oil, which has many side 
effects, and the aril. 
};>- RoASTED NUTMEG SEED 0* ~ ji ~ wei rou dou kou) 
Roasting removes a portion of the oil content, and thus 
reduces not only its potential for irritating the intestines 
(which can cause diarrhea), but also the hallucinogenic 
toxin myristicin, which is a component of the oil (see 
ToxiCITY above). Roasting also enhances its ability to bind 
up the Intestines and stop diarrhea. For these reasons, 
while the unprepared product is available, it is generally 
roasted before using as a medicine. 
There are several roasting methods. One uses bran, to 
which nutmeg seeds which have been soaked for one hour 
in water are added. The mixture is slowly dry-fried at a 
moderate heat until the seeds turn dark brown, after which 
the bran is sifted out; the seeds are then pulverized before 
use. In some places, a dough made of white flour (in the 
late seventeenth century, Zhang Lu recommended gluti-
nous rice flour) is wrapped around the nutmeg seeds, or 
the moistened seeds are rolled in a basket containing flour 
until thoroughly covered. The flour-covered seeds are then 
baked until oil begins to extrude from the dough, which has 
begun to turn black. The dough is then peeled away while 
still hot. Again, the seeds are pulverized before use. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of large, hard and solid, heavy, oily, 
and fragrant seeds with a distinct pattern on cross section.

Commentary 
Sour and astringent, Granati Pericarpium (shi Liu pi) is 
most commonly used internally for its binding action 
on the Intestines, to stop diarrhea, and for uncontrolled 
uterine bleeding and vaginal discharge. Because it is warm-
ing in nature, it is most appropriate for these disorders 
when they are caused by cold from deficiency. The earliest 
materia medica text also said it was indicated for securing 
the essence, but this is mentioned less frequently in later 
centuries. 
The Grand Materia Medica says that it "stops diar-
rhea, dysenteric disorders, Intestinal bleeding, prolapsed 
rectum, incessant uterine bleeding, and vaginal discharge." 
Omissions from the [Classic of the] Materia Medica adds 
that it "governs roundworms; take in decoction." 
Li Shi-Zhen explains that the pomegranate 
receives lesser yang qi [by virtue of its growing season] ... 
its flavor is sweet and sour, it is warm and astringent, it pos-
sesses the attributes of wood and fire. Thus over-consump-
tion [of the fruit] injures the Lungs and teeth, and generates 
phlegm and thin mucus. Sourness restrains and inhibits the 
qi, and so it is a herb that stops diarrhea and incessant uter-
ine bleeding. It is said that white pomegranate peel treats 
white dysenteric disorder, while red pomegranate peel 
treats red dysenteric disorder; this is not unreasonable. 
Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica reiterates this use for 
red dysenteric disorder: "Sour, astringent, and warm, it can 
bind the Intestines and stop diarrhea and dysenteric dis-
order with [rectal] bleeding." As an example of this appli-
cation, Formulas of Universal Benefit {from My Practice} 
contains the single-herb formula Miraculous Investiture 
Powder (shin shou san), which is designed for chronic 
dysenteric disorders. This formula is composed of 9-12g of 
charred Granati Pericarpium (shi liu pi), in powdered form, 
taken with rice soup. 
References to the herb's effects on the Lungs, and also 
the Liver, appear in some texts. In Essays on Medicine 
Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western, Zhang 
Xi-Chun presents his less conventional views about the 
qualities of this herb: 
Its nature is slightly cooling so it can inhibit Liver fire 
while guarding and harmonizing the Lung qi, and it is an 
important herb in the treatment of the cough and wheez-
ing of Lung consumption, with deficiency failing to contain 
the qi. It is also an important herb in the treament of Liver 
deficiency wind disturbance [or] ministerial fire floating 
outward. 
Applied externally, it appears in traditional formulas that 
are designed to treat such disorders as prolapsed rectum, 
sores, and deep-rooted toxic swellings. The action implied 
by the latter indication is not clearing of toxic heat, but 
rather a drawing and lifting out: "even the root [of the deep 
sore] comes out by itself!" exclaims Emergency Formulas to 
Keep Up One's Sleeve. The ancient technique described in 
that book combines acupuncture and moxibustion: four 
needles are inserted around the deep-rooted sore, and a 
section of Granati Pericarpium (shi liu pi) is placed over the 
sore itself. Moxa is applied to the four sides of the peel "until
