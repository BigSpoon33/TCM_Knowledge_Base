## 📖 Overview

Tsaoko Fructus (*cao guo*) enters the Spleen and Stomach channels. It is warm, drying, and intensely acrid, with a strong, fetid odor reminiscent of *Mylabris* (*ban mao*). It is best for warming and drying the middle burner, and is an important herb for treating cold-dampness lurking constrained in the Spleen and Stomach. It eliminates phlegm and has a significant place in the treatment of malarial disorders; it is often combined with *Anemarrhenae Rhizoma* (*zhi mu*) or *Dichroae Radix* (*chang shan*) for this purpose.

When alternating fever and chills occur in early-stage epidemic disorders, accompanied by turbid dampness, Tsaoko Fructus (*cao guo*) is also used, as in the formula Reach the Source Drink (*da yuan yin*) from Discussion of Warm Epidemics.

Tsaoko Fructus (*cao guo*) is used in the treatment of constrained blockage of turbid phlegm with a thick, white, greasy tongue coating, stifling sensation in the chest, and nausea. It also treats abdominal distention and loss of appetite due to clumping and constraint of cold-dampness.

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica explains that this herb is "acrid, warm, and intensely drying, and excels at eliminating cold-dampness and warmly drying the middle palace. For this reason, it is a primary herb for treating Spleen and Stomach cold-dampness." The author of that book, Zhang Shan-Lei, also writes that it "excels at washing away phlegm-dampness and arousing the Spleen yang; when assisted by *Anemarrhenae Rhizoma* (*zhi mu*), and the doses are adjusted as appropriate in each instance, it is of great value in the treatment of malarial disorders."

However, due to its strong, fetid odor, Tsaoko Fructus (*cao guo*) has a tendency to cause vomiting. Roasting or dry-frying the herb with ginger juice reduces this side effect.
