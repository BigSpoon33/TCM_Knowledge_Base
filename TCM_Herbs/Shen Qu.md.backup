## 📖 Overview

Massa medicata fermentata (shén qū) is acrid, sweet, and warm, but its acrid flavor does not overly disperse, its sweetness does not accumulate or obstruct, and its warmth does not dry. It is highly valued for its ability to promote the flow of qi, regulate the middle, reduce food stagnation, and unbind the Stomach. It is most appropriate for food stagnation due to overconsumption of starch and grains, leading to qi stasis with abdominal distention and diarrhea.

This substance directs qi downward and transforms phlegm, warms the Stomach, and transforms thin mucus. Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica explains that it is acrid, sweet, and warm; disperses qi, regulates the middle, warms the Stomach, transforms phlegm, drives out water, and reduces stagnation. In children it tonifies the Spleen.

Physicians use it for regulating treatments; however, for best results it should be combined with herbs that tonify the Spleen.

As a substance that strengthens the Spleen, it alleviates diarrhea and distention: "[It treats] all disorders of diarrhea, dysentery, distention, and fullness." (Grand Materia Medica) Less well-known, however, is its ability to reduce lactation and facilitate weaning: "For postpartum women who wish to cease lactating, dry-fry and grind [it], then take 6g with wine twice a day until the milk stops: very effective." (Grand Materia Medica)
