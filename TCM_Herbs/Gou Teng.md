## 📖 Overview

Uncariae Ramulus cum Uncis (gou teng) is sweet, slightly cold, and enters the Liver and Pericardium channels. The Liver governs wind, and the Pericardium governs fire. Wind and fire can provoke each other to cause such disorders as childhood convulsions, dizziness, and headaches. Because this herb is light, clearing, and cooling, not only for draining fire, but also settling wind, it can treat such patterns as extreme heat generating convulsions and Liver channel heat, or ascendant Liver yang leading to dizziness, headache, and red eyes. It is particularly appropriate for childhood convulsions. Because of its light, clearing, and draining nature, it is also used for externally-contracted headache and red eyes, or for spots and rashes that fail to surface.

Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica states that it is swift and sharp by nature; in an instant it can expel wind phlegm, open blocked qi, or quiet down childhood convulsions ... however, if decocted for long it has no power. After the other herbs have boiled sufficiently, put it in and immediately lift [the pot from the stove] so it will be at its strongest.

Chen Shi-Duo warns that it should be used with an eye to treating the root of the condition, explaining in New Compilation of Materia Medica that it very quickly eliminates wind, and must be used for [internal] wind patterns. However, the generation of wind-fire is usually caused by insufficiency of Kidney water, which leads to dryness of wood and fire blazing. Using a little bit of Uncariae Ramulus cum Uncis (gou teng) among herbs that tonify the yin readily disperses the wind-fire. If one does not tonify the yin, and only uses Uncariae Ramulus cum Uncis (gou teng) to eliminate wind and disperse fire, the wind will not be extinguished and the fire will flare even more!

In Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, the early twentieth-century writer Zhang Shan-Lei says that it was considered an excellent herb for children in the earlier materia medica texts, and that it is in fact quite well-suited for this by nature: "It is light and clearing, with a sweet, cold nature that is most appropriate for constitutions with the not-yet-filled childish yin and the readily exuberant childish yang." He goes on to explain its ability to treat childhood convulsions:

The reason that it can treat convulsions is that seizure disorder is an illness caused by Liver blazing and generating wind, qi, and fire flaring upward and surging into the neurons of the brain. This substance is light in weight, clearing and cooling, able to drain fire and also to settle wind.
