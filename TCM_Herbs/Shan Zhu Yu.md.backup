## 📖 Overview

Sour and slightly warm in nature, Corni Fructus (*shan zhu yu*) augments the Liver and Kidneys, while binding and securing so that the benefits of this augmentation are retained without loss. The *Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians* says that it "Strengthens the yin, augments the essence, quiets the five organs, brightens the eyes after long-term consumption, strengthens vigor, and lengthens life." *Grandfather Lei's Discussion of Herb Preparation* adds that it "fortifies the primal qi." When the essential qi and the yin are strong, the organs will naturally function at a better level, particularly the Kidneys and Bladder. The *Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi* says that the herb "Warms the lower back and knees, and assists the water organ." But its benefit extends to other aspects of the Kidneys as well: *Discussion of Medicinal Properties* says that it "Treats brain and bone pain, halts irregular periods, tonifies the Kidney qi, excites the way of yang [male sexual function], replenishes the essence and marrow, remedies tinnitus . . . and stops incontinence in the elderly."

This herb is not only beneficial to the Liver, it also benefits the Heart through the Liver. *Pouch of Pearls* says that it "Warms the Liver." *Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances* elaborates:

[It] enriches the yin and augments the blood, primarily treating blurred vision, tinnitus, bitter taste, dry throat, greenish tinge to the complexion with loss of color, sweating followed by shaking chills—this is a fine herb for tonifying the Liver and assisting the Gallbladder. Now, the Heart is the child of the Liver. The Heart can be afflicted by chaotic dispersal, but favors conservation and containment; when contained, it is quietly tranquil; when quiet, it is clear and harmonious. Using [this herb] to restrain the dissipation of the Heart can treat frail, deficient Heart qi with palpitations—this is the concept of ‘yin deficiency, tonify the mother.’ At the same time, the Kidneys are the mother of the Liver. The Kidneys favor moisture and abhor dryness, and must store the essential qi. One uses the sourness of this [herb] to conserve loss, holding in the water to generate yang fluids, and thereby treating spermatorrhea and cloudy urine, impotence, incontinence, weak softness of the lower back and knees, and sore aching of the feet—this is the concept of ‘the child making the mother strong.’

According to several materia medica texts, such as *Wu Pu’s Materia Medica* (where the idea is attributed to Qi Bo in the *Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic*) and *Discussion of Medicinal Properties*, this herb also has an acrid flavor that enables it to mildly disperse. Thus, *Commentary on Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica* states that "This herb is warm so that it unblocks and promotes movement, its acrid flavor mobilizes and disperses, while its sourness enters the Liver and inhibits heat from deficiency." *Discussion of Medicinal Properties* goes so far as to say that it can stimulate sweating. However, in *Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica*, Zhang Lu disagrees: "This is a mistake, it should say that it inhibits sweating. As it has a sour-restraining quality, there is no rationale for discharging outward."

In *Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western*, Zhang Xi-Chun has an interesting way of explaining this, short of attributing an acrid flavor to the herb:

The flavor of Corni Fructus (*shan zhu yu*) is sour, its nature is warm. Greatly restrains and inhibits the primal qi, bracing [one's subjective feeling of] energy, stabilizing and binding loss through leakage. Because it obtains a full measure of wood qi, within its binding restraint it possesses a nature that facilitates movement . . . furthermore, it holds in the normal qi but does not hold in pathogenic qi, unlike other sour-restraining herbs . . . [when I say that it] obtains a full measure of wood qi, and within its sour conservation it possesses a great ability to open and unblock, the reason is that wood by nature favors thrusting outward. When the *Divine Husbandman* says that it governs cold damp painful obstruction, and authors of other materia medica texts say that it unblocks and facilitates the nine orifices, we can see [from this] that its nature does not only tonify the Liver, but also facilitates and unblocks the flow of qi and blood. If one only regards it as something to restrain and inhibit, this is really viewing it in too shallow a manner.

Zhang has other interesting comments to make about the herb's use in treating abandonment disorders:

The abandonment of a person's primal qi is always lost through the Liver. Hence extreme deficiency in a person will always first stir up Liver wind. The movement of Liver wind is the portent of primal qi abandonment! Likewise, the Liver and Gallbladder rely on each other as yin and yang organs; the Gallbladder is lesser yang, for which the major disorder is alternating chills and fever. The Liver is terminal yin, and if deficiency reaches its extreme, there will also be alternating chills and fever. With chills and fever, there will usually be sweating. Since [this herb] can inhibit sweating, and also felicitously tonifies the Liver, it is therefore most effective when the Liver is extremely deficient and the primal qi is close to collapse.

Zhang concludes that he had discovered this effect of Corni Fructus (*shan zhu yu*) in his own practice, and thought it an original observation, until he found it in the *Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica*: "This even more demonstrated the quintessential relevance of the *Divine Husbandman*, truly beyond anything that later materia medica texts can equal!"
