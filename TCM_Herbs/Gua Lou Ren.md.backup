## 📖 Overview

In addition to moistening the Intestines, *Trichosanthis Semen* (*gua lou ren*) also moistens phlegm in the Lungs and thereby loosens it so that it can be coughed up. By cooling upper burner fire, it protects and generates the yang fluids and alleviates thirst. Zhu Dan-Xi described it as a "sage-like herb for wasting and thirsting disorder."

Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances notes that long-term, stubborn, constrained phlegm retained internally can obstruct the ascent and descent of qi, causing a stifling sensation in the chest, cough, insatiable thirst (due to impaired fluid transport), and the sound of phlegm in the throat, where the phlegm itself is difficult to expectorate. According to this source, *Trichosanthis Semen* (*gua lou ren*) is selected to utilize its slippery moistening power to scour foul grease from the diaphragmatic area. Phlegm will then be reduced and qi will descend, the chest will feel free and coughs will ease, thirst will be alleviated and fluids will be produced- all symptoms will be relieved. Its oil is exceedingly capable of moistening the Lungs and lubricating the Intestines. If pathogenic fire dries and clumps in the Large Intestine, use it to assist bitter, cold herbs, then the Intestine will naturally unblock and move freely.

Some also feel that the slippery nature of this herb can benefit other orifices, such as the urethra, and therefore advocate its use to promote urination. Similarly, Li Shi Zhen recorded a formula using the dry powder of dry-fried *Trichosanthis Semen* (*chao gua lou ren*) to promote lactation, 3g of which are to be taken internally with warm wine.
