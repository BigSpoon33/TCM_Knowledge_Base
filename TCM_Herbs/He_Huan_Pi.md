to reddish brown, is considered equivalent to the original 
crimson ganoderma ( 1t-:it chi zhf). 
While the two are considered therapeutically equiva-
lent, the term divine ganoderma :lit :it ling zhf by itself is 
generally understood to refer to Ganoderma lucidum. This 
species is also known as red ganoderma (~x..-;t hong zhf) 
or cinnabar ganoderma ( 1T :it dan zhf). G. japonicum is 
darker and is also known as purple ganoderma ( 1k :it z! 
zhf), black ganoderma (.~,:it hei zhf), or dark ganoderma 
(1: :it xudn zhf). 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality is unfragmented, purplish red, and glossy.

Commentary 
Sweet and neutral, Albiziae Cortex (he huiin pf) augments 
the Heart and Spleen, releases Liver constraint, invigorates 
the blood, stops pain, generates flesh, and reconnects 
bones. It is most often used for patterns of Liver constraint 
leading to stifling sensations in the chest, worry, bad 
temper, forgetfulness, and insomnia, but is also useful for 
injuries from trauma, and the pain of sores and boils. The 
Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica states: 
Flavor sweet and neutral. Primarily quiets the five yin 
organs, focuses the mind, and makes people happy without 
care. Long-term consumption will lighten the body, bright-
en the eyes, and [allow people to] achieve their desires. 
Supplement to the Extension of the Materia Medica notes 
that it "has a marked yin-tonic effect, which is visible in its 
abilities to grow flesh and muscle, and reconnect sinews 
and bones." Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica 
elaborates: 
Albiziae Cortex (he huiin p(), sweet, warm, and tonifying, 
has the marvelous quality [of allowing] the five spirits to 
open and reach outward, and eliminating [extremes of] the 
five emotions ... its flavor is sweet, and neutral in quality, 
it primarily harmonizes and moderates the Heart qi: when 
the Heart qi is harmonious and moderate, then the con-
sciousness naturally opens to happiness without care! 
Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica, however, cautions 
that sufficient dosage be used to achieve the desired result: 
"Albiziae Cortex (he huiin pf) has a moderate and mild 
effect that cannot achieve results in small doses, thus large 
doses and extended consumption is necessary before it 
can tonify, augment, and make happy the Heart's resolve." 
The author continues, asking rhetorically, "If one seeks, 
in acute illnesses, to cure and create joy, is it equal to the 
task?" While many texts record the standard dosage to be 6 
to 9g, in practice, dosages of 15g are common. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
);>- WITH PAEONIAE RADIX ALBA (bai shao) 
The Liver stores the blood, while the Heart governs the 
blood; the Liver favors reaching and thrusting outward, 
while the Heart stores consciousness. If the nutritive blood 
is insufficient, the Liver wood will lack softening moistness, 
the Heart spirit will lack nourishment, and the clinical 
result will be anxiety, irritability, worry, and insomnia. 
This combination is well-suited to this condition, as the 
sour, blood nourishing properties of Paeoniae Radix alba 
(bai shao) enter the Liver blood level to nourish and soften 
Liver wood, and, upon this foundation, the sweet and 
harmonious qi and blood regulating properties of Albiziae 
Cortex (he huiin pf) then relieve Liver constraint to calm 
the spirit, helping the Liver qi regain its normal outward-
spreading qi flow.

Comparisons 
);>- Vs. PoLYGoNr MuLTIFLORr CAuus (yejiao teng) 
Both herbs calm the spirit, but Albiziae Cortex (he huiin 
pf) soothes the Heart and Spleen qi, while Polygoni mul-
tiflori Caulis (ye jiiio teng) nourishes the Heart and Liver 
blood. Albiziae Cortex (he huiin pi) also invigorates the 
blood, stops pain, and reconnects sinews and bones, while 
Polygoni multiflori Caulis (ye jiiio teng) expels wind in the 
collaterals to stop itching and treat skin disorders.
