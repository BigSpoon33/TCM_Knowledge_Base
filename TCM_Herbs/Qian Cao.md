## 📖 Overview

Acrid, bitter, and cold, Rubiae Radix (qian cao) enters the Heart and Liver channels. Its bitterness drains, its coldness cools, and its acridity invigorates the blood and removes stasis. Because it enters the blood aspect of the Heart and Liver, it can cool heat generated by pathologies in these two organs, both of which are crucial to blood physiology. In fact, the Inner Classic says that "The Heart expels blood while the Liver accepts blood [just like] the Lungs expel qi while the Kidneys grasp qi." Rubiae Radix (qian cao) can be used in the treatment of bleeding from any part of the body, for either heat in the blood or blood stasis, as well as bleeding associated with trauma.

In addition, this herb stops bleeding by removing the stasis that forces blood out of its normal pathways. In many cases the stasis itself is due to heat drying the fluids within the blood, thereby slowing its flow. Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica refers directly to its ability to stop bleeding:

"In the first place, [Rubiae Radix (qian cao)] clears heat within the blood, in the second, it unblocks accumulated blocked stasis, so that the blood follows its accustomed route and does not flow off rebelliously."

There are several auxiliary uses for this herb. One is to disperse wind-dampness in the treatment of painful obstruction, as noted in the Grand Materia Medica: "Unblocks channels and vessels, treats wind pain in the bones and joints." Another is cooling the Liver and transforming phlegm, so that it treats chronic stubborn cough with pain in the chest due to Liver heat accosting the Lungs, usually with such herbs as Mori Cortex (sang bai pi), Lycii Cortex (di gu pi), Indigo naturalis (qing dai), and Meretricis/Cyclinae Concha (ge qiao). Modern research has shown that it has a marked suppressant effect on a number of common lung pathogens.

Traditionally, it was thought that the herb should be used in its charred form in order to stop bleeding, while for removing blood stasis, the unprepared herb should be used. It is now known that it can also stop bleeding in its unprepared form, although it is more effective if at least dry-fried.

- Use with caution in those with cold from deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach, diminished blood, and fire from yin deficiency. Do not use long term. See Toxicity below.
- Slippery by nature, it moves blood, and its use is forbidden in all fevers from overexertion or internal heat due to yin deficiency without blood stasis.

"Essence-deficient patients, and those with lack of blood or weak Spleen and Stomach, or yin deficiency with blazing fire, are all forbidden to use it." (Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica)

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica states that if the bleeding is due to "deficient qi failing to contain the blood, or if the patient has Spleen cold, do not use it."
