16 I Substances that Extinguish Wind and Stop Tremors 
so that it enters the skin and eventually completely fills 
the insect body, transforming it into its distinctive white, 
mummified appearance. The traditional explanation is that 
the silkworms are attacked and killed by externally-con-
tracted wind, with its association to the skin, Lungs, and the 
color white (see CoMMENTARY above.) The dead silkworms 
are placed in ashes to absorb their moisture, then dried in 
the sun or baked dry at a low temperature. 
The literal meaning of the name a 11: it bdi jiang can 
is white mummified silkworm. I; can means silkworm, 
the original character being a picture, "the image of its 
head and body," according to Li Shi-Zhen. Li also explains 
that "dead but not decomposing is called mummified (11: 
jiang)." Because its color is white, it is usually known as 
white mummified silkworm (a -flit bcii jiang can). It is 
also commonly known as heavenly bug ( :k/1 tian chong), 
and ginger silkworm (l it jiang can), which is a homonym 
of its simple name, mummified silkworm (-It R jiang can). 
Silkworm powder (-flit .;f:.. jiangcan mo) is either the raw or 
the dry-fried silkworm ground into fine powder. Without 
further processing, it is called raw silkworm ( 1:.11: it sheng 
jiang can), which is strongly-even intensely-acrid and 
dispersing. Its properties are altered somewhat when dry-
fried with bran. 
::» DRY-FRIED SILKWORM (:J:;!l-ftl; chao jiang can) 
Bran is heated in a wok until it smokes, then the silkworms 
are added and dry-fried until they turn yellow. Once 
cooled, the bran is sifted away. This is also called processed 
silkworm (~ 11: it zhl jitmg can). Once dry-fried, its ability 
to dredge wind and travel through the exterior is somewhat 
reduced, while its phlegm-transforming and dispersing 
actions are strengthened. Hence it is more appropriate for 
treating childhood convulsions, seizures, cramps, scrofula, 
and phlegm nodules. This method also reduces its slightly 
objectionable odor and flavor, so in many places this will be 
dispensed when no other preference is specified. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of thick, hard, white bodies with a 
lustrous surface on cross section. Bodies without a white 
powdery surface, and with a hollow cross section, must not 
be used.

Commentary 
Salty, acrid, neutral, and toxic, Scorpio (quan xie) has a 
piercing, opening nature that enters the Liver channel to 
strongly extinguish internal wind, halt spasms, unblock the 
collaterals, track down externally-contracted wind lodged 
internally, and stop pain. The Grand Materia Medica 
explains: 
Scorpions come from the east, are green in color, and per-
tain to wood: a medicinal of the leg terminal yin channel. 
They therefore treat disorders of the terminal yin: all wind 
vertigo and dizziness, cramping, spasms, chills and fever in 
malarial disorder, poor hearing and deafness-all of these 
are terminal yin wind wood [conditions]. 
As an important wind-extinguishing substance, Scorpio 
(quan xie) is used in the treatment of seizures, spasms, 
convulsions, wind-stroke, facial paralysis, muscular tetany, 
tremors of the hands and feet, twitching, and torticol-
lis. However, it is also effective for wind-damp painful 
obstruction, headache, and migraines. Consistent with the 
theory of "using toxin to attack toxins," it is also applied 
externally to treat scrofula, toxic sores, and mumps. 
Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica states that it 
specifically enters the Liver channel to expel wind. lt is 
used in all cases of children's fetal wind convulsions, adult 
hemiplegia, paralysis of the face and mouth, impaired 
speech, spasms of the hands and feet, chills and fever due 
to malarial disorders, tinnitus, and vaginal discharge, when 
these are due to external wind lodging internally. 
The contemporary physician Xiao Xi-Fang describes his 
experience with this substance: 
Animal medicinals can be used in the treatment of stub-
born headaches according to the dictum 'early [stage] 
disorders are in the channels, long-term pain enters the col-
laterals.' They can be added to the original prescription to 
unblock the collaterals and stop pain with good results. Of 
these, Scorpio (qudn xie) is an essential item; the scorpion 
tail is especially effective. Generally, five to seven tails are 
used for adults [combining as follows]: for wind-damp-
ness, add Bombyx batryticatus (bdi jiiing cdn); for cold with 
dampness, add Scolopendra (wu gong); for Liver yang and 
heat constraint, add Pheretima (dll6ng); and for severe 
continuous pain, scorpion tail should be combined with 
Pheretima ( dll6ng), Bombyx batryticatus (bdi jiiing cdn), 
and Scolopendra (wu gong). 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
~ WITH UNCARIAE RAMULUS CUM UNCIS (gou teng) 
Scorpio (quan xie) enters the Liver channel to extinguish in-
ternal wind, open the collaterals, and track down externally-
contracted wind lodged internally. Uncariae Ramulus cum 
Uncis (gou teng) enters the Liver and Heart channels, cool-
ing heat to calm the Liver and extinguish wind. Combined, 
each substance enhances the other: one calms while the 
other strongly extinguishes wind. This combination is often 
used in the treatment of seizures, convulsions, spasms, and 
tics, hemiplegia due to wind-stroke, numbness and pain in 
the limbs, and stubborn migraines or trigeminal neuralgia 
from Liver wind or ascendant Liver yang.

Comparisons 
~ Vs. TYPHONII RHIZOMA PREPARATUM (zhi baifu zi) 
Both are toxic substances that expel wind and stop spasms.

16 I Substances that Extinguish Wind and Stop Tremors 
They are used together in the treatment of facial paralysis, 
tentenus, and convulsions. Scorpio (quan xie), however, 
more strongly expels wind to stop spasms and convul-
sions. By contrast, Typhonii Rhizoma preparatum (zhl bai 
fu zi), which is acrid, warm, and intensely drying, with an 
ascending and dispersing nature, is especially indicated 
for pathogenic wind-phlegm in the face and head with 
such symptoms as facial paralysis, hemiplegia, scrofula, 
migraine headaches, or other severe lateral headaches. 
Typhonii Rhizoma preparatum (zhl bai fu zi) can also be 
used for wind-stroke with profuse phlegm welling up in the 
throat, making speech difficult. 
Again, both are used externally in disorders such as 
scrofula, but Scorpio ( quan xie) is also applied for sores and 
toxic swellings, while Typhonii Rhizoma preparatum (zhl 
bai fu zi) is applied to skin disorders such as chloasma.

SCOLOPENDRA (wu gong); see page 990 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Toxic; this is a wind substance. When a disorder resem-
bles wind-stroke, but is deficient, it is contraindicated, as it 
is for children's chronic Spleen wind." (Harm and Benefit 
in the Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
Scorpion is toxic, yet poisonings are extremely rare, as the 
toxin is not heat resistant: heating for 30 minutes at lOO"C 
destroys the toxin. The toxic dosage, used in decoction, is 
30-60g, and 2lg for direct ingestion in raw powder form. 
The symptoms of poisoning, which appear two hours after 
ingestion, include itching of the anal and genital areas, 
urinary pain and obstruction, headache, dizziness, high 
blood pressure, arrhythmias (primarily bradycardia), and 
hemolysis. In severe cases there can be low blood pres-
sure, dyspnea, cyanosis, coma, and death from respiratory 
paralysis. Oral administration of scorpion has resulted in 
such allergic reactions as papular erythema, blisters, exu-
dation, exfoliative dermatitis, and occassionally severe 
abdominal pain. 
The modern text Materia Medica of Toxic Herbs pro-
vides a Chinese herbal antidote for poisoning from over-
dosage: a decoction of Lonicerae Flos (j!n y fn huii) 30g, 
Lobeliae chinensis Herba (bim biiin lian) 9g, Smilacis 
glabrae Rhizoma (tu fu ling) lSg, Phaseoli radiati Semen 
(lil dim) lSg, and Glycyrrhizae Radix (giin dw) 9g. Another 
formula from the same source is Trogopterori Faeces (wu 
ling zhl) 9g, raw Typhae Pollen (pu huang) 9g, and Realgar 
(xi6ng huang) 3g, finely powdered and divided into three 
doses, taken every four hours, and washed down with 
vinegar. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Both farmed and wild-crafted, Buthus martensi is one of the 
more toxic scorpion species in China. Because the whole 
scorpion is commonly used, it is generally called complete 
scorpion (~*~ quan xie) or complete insect (~Ji quan 
chong), and is also known as scorpion (!It~+ xie zi), dried 
scorpion (-*t,!k~ gan xie), or simply scorpion (!It~ xie). The 
tail is considered the most potent part. To specify this part 
in a prescription, the term is scorpion tail(!!!~~ xie wei) or 
scorpion tip (*~*Jli xie shiio). The pharmaceutical name is 
Scorpionis Cauda. As explained by Li Shi-Zhen: "Its poison 
is in the tail; at present, for medicinal purposes, some use 
the whole [scorpion], which is called complete scorpion, 
and some use the tail, which is called scorpion tip-its 
power is especially concentrated." 
Scorpions are captured in the spring, summer, or 
autumn. The spring scorpion (.{f.*~ chun xie) is preferred, 
as in the summer the scorpions burrow for coolness, during 
which time they imbibe silt, which reduces its commercial 
quality. These are called lurking scorpions (R*~ fu xie). 
When collected, the scorpions are first put in clean water 
until they drown, then they are boiled in fresh or slightly 
salted water for three to four hours until the body arches 
backward, the abdomen splits, and the back curls into a 
hook. They are then removed, rinsed, and any residual silt 
in the abdomen is washed away. Drying should be done on 
mats in the shade, as direct sunlight will cause the salt crys-
tals to whiten the color. On rainy or overcast days, baking 
at a low temperature is advised. 
When salt water is used in the above preparation (as 
is common), it is called salt scorpion (!!l*~+ y an xie zi); 
when fresh water is used, it is called clear water scorpion 
u~-7]d~-f- qfng shui xie zi). 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality is unfragmented, yellowish brown, and has 
little if any salt efflorescence on its surface.
