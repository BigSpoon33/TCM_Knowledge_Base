## 📖 Overview

Bitter, sour, and slightly cold, Sanguisorbae Radix (di yu) enters the Liver, Stomach, and Large Intestine channels. Its bitter flavor directs downward, its sour astringency inhibits bleeding, and its slight coldness cools heat. Its ability to clear heat is not excessively draining, and its sour-restraint is not overly astringent; it is therefore regarded as one of the finest cooling-astringent hemostatic herbs. Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi says that it "Stops vomiting of blood, flooding from the nose, unceasing menstruation, heavy continuous uterine bleeding, and all bleeding disorders surrounding parturition."

Traditionally, the nature of this herb is described as descending and sinking into the lower burner; thus, while it is good for hot-blood type bleeding anywhere in the body, it is especially indicated for fire in the lower burner with chaotically moving blood causing blood in the stool or urine, bleeding hemorrhoids, bleeding dysentery, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica notes that it:

"...cools the blood, and specifically governs blood heat, treats sores, and stops sweating. It is also bitter and cold in nature, it sinks and directs straight downward, and thus mainly governs lower burner bleeding conditions, such as blood in the urine or stool, bloody painful urinary dribbling, Intestinal wind, bleeding hemorrhoids, bloody dysenteric disorder, uterine flooding, vaginal discharge, and the like. Yet it is only appropriate when there is heat in the blood-it cannot be recklessly used for one who is yang-deficient, or unable to contain the blood."

The Grand Materia Medica concurs that it "expels lower burner heat, and treats bleeding from the bowels or urine."

The other major action of this herb is to resolve toxicity while restraining and inhibiting, and thus it is used for sores, ulcers, and injuries from burns, as it not only cools heat in the blood, but can also reduce swelling and stop pain, and its contracting sourness assists the lesions to heal over by generating new flesh. Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians says that it "stops pus and blood [treats] all chronic sores, toxic sores, and hot sores."

## ⚡ Functions & Actions

- **Cools the blood and stops bleeding:** especially for bleeding in the lower burner due to damp-heat with such symptoms as blood in the stool, bleeding hemorrhoids, bloody dysenteric disorders, and excessive uterine bleeding. Also used for vomiting blood and nosebleed.
    - With Sophorae Flos Immaturus (huai mi) for hot bleeding hemorrhoids. Herbs such as Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang), Paeoniae Radix Alba (bai shao), and Scutellariae Radix (huang qin) are often added.
    - With Sophorae Flos (huai hua), Schizonepetae Spica (jing jie sui), and Platycladi Cacumen (ce bai ye) for wind-heat or damp-heat lodging in the Intestines manifesting as bright red bleeding from the rectum, typically just before the passage of stool, as in Sophora Flower Powder (huai hua san).
    - With Coptidis Rhizoma (huang lian), Aucklandiae Radix (mu xiang), and Mume Fructus (wu mei) for bloody stools, bleeding dysenteric disorders, bleeding hemorrhoids, and chronic damp-heat induced vaginal discharge.
    - With Artemisiae Argyi Folium (ai ye), Asini Corii Colla (e jiao), and Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu) for vaginal bleeding with abdominal pain close to labor before the water has broken.
- **Clears heat and generates flesh:** applied topically for sores, ulcers, and injuries from burns. It both reduces the oozing by holding in the fluids, and promotes the generation of new flesh. Often used for burns.
    - With Sophorae Flavescentis Radix (ku shen) as a topical plaster for burns and damp-heat skin lesions such as eczema.
    - With Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang), made into a paste with sesame oil, as a plaster for burns. This accelerates healing and reduces the pain.
