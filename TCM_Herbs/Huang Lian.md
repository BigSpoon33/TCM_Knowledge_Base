## üìñ Overview

*Coptidis Rhizoma* (huang lian) is very bitter, very cold, and drying in nature and enters the Heart, Liver, Stomach, and Large Intestine channels. Its intense coldness enables it to cool heat and resolve toxicity; its intense bitterness enables it to drain fire and dry dampness. Hence its importance in the treatment of damp-heat, constrained fire, and heat toxin. It is best at draining Heart and Stomach fire, while clearing damp-heat from the Stomach and Intestines.

In *Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica*, Zhang Shan-Lei elaborates:

*Coptidis Rhizoma* (huang lian) is very bitter and very cold: bitterness dries dampness, coldness prevails over heat; it can drain and direct downward all excessive damp-fire, and can treat heat in the Heart, Spleen, Liver, and Kidneys, and all fire in the Gallbladder, Stomach, and Large and Small Intestines. In the upper body, it clears eye disorders due to wind and fire; in the middle it calms nausea and vomiting due to [pathology of the] Liver and Stomach; in the lower body it unblocks dysenteric disorders with abdominal pain - all of this results from its drying dampness and clearing heat. In addition, bitterness enters the Heart, clearing and scouring out blood heat.

To bring about these results, Zhang explains that *Coptidis Rhizoma* (huang lian) must be combined with other herbs, depending on the condition:

Yet in order to obtain a successful result, for eye disorders one must combine [herbs that] drain wind and promote blood movement; for dysenteric disorders one must combine [herbs that] promote qi movement and guide out turbidity; for nausea and vomiting one must combine [herbs that] hold down and transform phlegm. If one only relies upon bitterness and coldness, this is not the ticket to success.

Zhang especially emphasized the drying effect of the herb's bitterness:

Also, [speaking of] the bitterness and coldness of *Coptidis Rhizoma* (huang lian), it is the bitterness that especially prevails, thus its capacity to dry dampness is uniquely apparent. All of those conditions which require the use of *Coptidis Rhizoma* (huang lian) are those which could be classified as constrained steaming of dampness and heat. One relies on the ability to dry, drain, and direct downward conferred by its bitter nature, not just how good it is at clearing heat.
