## 📖 Overview

Acrid and very warming, Alpiniae officinarum Rhizoma (gao liang jiang) specifically disperses pathogenic cold in the Spleen and Stomach to warm the middle, stop pain, direct rebellious qi downward, and alleviate nausea. It is often used in the treatment of cold pain in the epigastrium, as well as hiccough, belching, nausea, and vomiting of clear fluids due to Stomach cold causing rebellious qi to ascend.

*The Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians* says that it "governs sudden cold, cold rebellion in the Stomach, and abdominal pain in sudden turmoil disorder."

*Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica* states that it "dispels cold dampness, and warms the Spleen and Stomach."
