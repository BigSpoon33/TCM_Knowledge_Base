## 📖 Overview

Acrid, dispersing, and warm, qualities which enable it to unblock, the clear aroma of Alpiniae katsumadai Semen (cao dou kou) is ideal for treating constrained clumping of cold-dampness in the middle burner, which disrupts the normal ascent and descent of qi. Symptoms include epigastric and abdominal cold pain and distention, nausea, epigastric discomfort, acid reflux, and a white, slippery tongue coating. This function also allows it to treat phlegm dampness constraining the Lungs and affecting breathing, causing fullness and a stifling sensation in the chest.

Supplement to the Extension of the Materia Medica observes that this herb is warm by nature, disperses stagnant qi, and reduces phlegm above the diaphragm. If it is obvious that the body has contracted pathogenic cold, [or the patient] consumes cold substances daily, with pain in the epigastric area, then one can warmly disperse, and the response will be as certain as the sound from a beaten drum; if a disorder results from will constraint and clumping of phlegm-dampness, it will also be effective.
