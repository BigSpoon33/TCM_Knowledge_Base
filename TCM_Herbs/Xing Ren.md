  # TCM Properties
  taste: [Bitter]
  temperature: "Slightly warm"
  channels: [Lung, Large Intestine]

  # Clinical Information
  dosage: "3-9g"
  toxicity: "Due to its cyanogenic glycoside content, this herb is toxic. Ten to 20 seeds is the toxic dosage for children, 40-60 seeds for adults. Ingestion of 50-120 seeds can cause death. The main reason for toxicity is accidental eating of the seeds by children, or self-treatment of small children with decoctions of the seed without the advice of a physician. Within the normal dosage range and taken as a decoction, no toxic side effects are to be expected (the suspension of the powdered kernels is 4-5 times as toxic as the decoction of the seeds). Peeled kernels are generally less toxic than unpeeled kernels. In part this is due to preparing the kernels for peeling by boiling them for a short time. Because cyanogenic glycosides are very unstable, this short treatment reduces the toxicity by about one-half. Symptoms of toxic reaction appear one to two hours after ingestion and include bitter and astringent taste, salivation, epigastric discomfort, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, general weakness, dyspnea, restlessness, terror, palpitations, and, in severe cases, coma, cyanosis, dilated pupils, and death by respiratory failure."

## 📖 Overview

Armeniacae Semen (杏仁 - xing ren) is bitter, warm, and slightly toxic. The bitterness directs downward, the warmth opens, and its moist property moistens dryness in the Lung and Large Intestine. In addition to directing rebellious qi downward to stop the cough and settle the wheezing, Armeniacae Semen (杏仁 - xing ren) can also disperse wind-cold and phlegm-dampness in the Lung channel.

Zhang Bing-Cheng elaborates in his Convenient Reader of Materia Medica:

When we investigate the nature of Armeniacae Semen (杏仁 - xing ren), it appears that it does not have an acrid flavor, and apparently only has a moistening, downward-directing action without any ability to release or disperse. Yet when the exterior is encumbered by wind-cold such that Lung qi accumulates and rebels, we cannot do without using this bitter herb to direct the rebellious qi downward, making the qi flow smoothly-the only way that the exterior can be released.

Li Shi-Zhen notes that this herb can disperse and direct qi downward, thus it releases the muscle layer and disperses wind, directs qi downward and moistens dryness, and reduces accumulation-for which latter effect it should be used with herbs that treat injury and trauma. It treats sores and kills parasites by virtue of its toxicity. Because it is hot in nature and directs downward, it is not an herb for long-term consumption.

## ⚡ Functions & Actions

Stops cough and calms wheezing: used quite broadly for many kinds of cough disorders caused by either heat or cold, depending on the combination. Because the herb is moist in nature, it is especially useful for externally-contracted dry cough.
  - With Perillae Folium (紫苏叶 - zi su ye) and Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum (制半夏 - zhi ban xia) for dry cough due to externally contracted wind-cold, as in Apricot Kernel and Perilla Leaf Powder (杏苏散 - xing su san).
  - With Mori Folium (桑叶 - sang ye) and Chrysanthemi Flos (菊花 - ju hua) for nonproductive dry cough due to externally-contracted wind-heat, as in Mulberry Leaf and Chrysanthemum Drink (桑菊饮 - sang ju yin).
  - With Mori Folium (桑叶 - sang ye), Fritillariae Cirrhosae Bulbus (川贝母 - chuan bei mu), and Glehniae/Adenophorae Radix (北沙参 - bei sha shen) for nonproductive cough from dry heat scorching the Lungs.
  - With Ophiopogonis Radix (麦门冬 - mai men dong) for dry cough due to dryness and heat injuring the Lungs.
  - With Ephedrae Herba (麻黄 - ma huang) for cough and wheezing due to excess, as in Three-Unbinding Decoction (三拗汤 - san ao tang).
  - Add Gypsum Fibrosum (石膏 - shi gao) for these symptoms plus significant Lung heat, as in Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Gypsum, and Licorice Decoction (麻杏石甘汤 - ma xing shi gan tang).
  - With Perillae Fructus (紫苏子 - zi su zi) for cough and wheezing accompanied by constipation.
  - With Amomi Fructus Rotundus (白豆蔻 - bai dou kou) and Coicis Semen (薏苡仁 - yi yi ren) for early stages of damp-warmth disorders with symptoms of heaviness of the head and body, stifling sensation in the chest, poor appetite, and afternoon fever, as in Three-Nut Decoction (三仁汤 - san ren tang).
- Moistens the Intestines and unblocks the bowels: this secondary use of the herb derives from its high oil content.
  - With Cannabis Semen (火麻仁 - huo ma ren) and Angelicae Sinensis Radix (当归 - dang gui) for constipation due to qi deficiency and dry Intestines, as in Five-Seed Pills (五仁丸 - wu ren wan).

**Contraindications:**
Because this is a bitter, warming, and draining herb, it should not be used for coughs due to yin deficiency or general debility. It should be used cautiously, if at all, in infants and those with diarrhea. And because of its toxicity, overdosage must be avoided. See TOXICITY below.

Zhang Jie-Bin noted that "If primal qi is deficient and sinking, do not use it, for fear that its descending will cause excessive direction of qi downward."
