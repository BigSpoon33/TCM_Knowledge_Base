72 I Tonifying Herbs 
Commentary 
Eleutherococci senticosi Radix et Caulis (ci wii jiii) is an ex-
ample of an herb whose qualities and functions have been 
revealed less from the accumulation of clinical experience 
than by modern research in the second half of the twenti-
eth century. Originally used as a variant of Eleutherococci 
gracilistyli Cortex (wii jiii pi), this herb is increasingly being 
used for symptoms of deficiency such as general weakness 
and malaise, loss of appetite, headache, insomnia, and 
impotence. 
Eleutherococci senticosi Radix et Caulis (ci wii jiii) is 
acrid, slightly bitter and warm. It enters the Spleen, Heart, 
and Kidney channels to tonify the Spleen and Kidney qi 
while calming the spirit and augmenting the Heart. At the 
same time, by virtue of its acrid and warm properties, it is 
also used to invigorate the blood and unblock the collater-
als, especially those obstructed by cold or blood stasis. 
The Spleen is affected by excessive thinking or pen-
siveness, the Heart controls the spirit, and the Kidneys 
are affected by fear. When these organs are deficient, 
emotional imbalance can readily occur. Eleutherococci 
senticosi Radix et Caulis ( ci wii jiii) can be used when there 
are symptoms indicating weakness of the Kidneys, Spleen, 
or Heart with such attendant symptoms as poor concentra-
tion, inappropriate laughter, mild depression, frustration, 
or fearfulness. 
The ability of this herb to invigorate the blood and 
unblock the collaterals can be used for improving periph-
eral circulation when the hands and feet are cold, or for any 
pain due to blood stasis. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "spiny five additions" 
This is the root bark or complete root of Eleutherococcus 
senticosus, which has also been known as Acanthopanax 
senticosus. The herb is both wild-crafted and cultivated. 
Recent research has shown that the root bark and stem 
bark have similar constituents. However, because the stem 
bark is easier to collect and does not require digging up the 
plant, it is more commonly used at present. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of thick, hard roots or stems with 
a yellowish white surface on cross section and a cooling, 
fragrant aroma.

Commentary 
Not a strong tonic, Polygonati Rhizoma (huang jlng) is 
typically used in combination with other tonifying herbs, 
which guide its direction: with qi-tonifying herbs, it tonifies 
the qi; with yin-tonifying herbs, it tonifies the yin; with 
herbs that tonify the Spleen and Stomach, it focuses on the 
middle burner; with herbs that tonify the Lungs, it moist-
ens the Lungs and is an excellent herb for the treatment 
of cough due to Lung consumption; and with herbs that 
tonify the Kidneys, it augments the essence. Rectification 
of the Meaning of Materia Medica observes that in some 
places it is consumed as a food. After steaming to make it 
soft, it 
can be eaten anytime. Sweet, but sticky and greasy, it is 
very similar to Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu dl huang). 
Ancient medical formulas very rarely included it, prob-
ably because things that can be eaten ordinarily are not 
medicines that eliminate illness. Its effective strengths are 
also those of Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu dl hudng)-
tonifying the blood and tonifying the yin-but it also nour-
ishes the Spleen and Stomach, which is its particular strong 
point. However, it is greasy and cloying, and should not be 
taken by those with dampness or phlegm, and those with 
poor appetite should also avoid it. 
Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi states that it "tonifies those 
with the five consumptions and seven injuries, reinforces 
the sinews and bones, alleviates hunger, increases resis-
tance to extremes in temperature, augments the Spleen and 
Stomach, and moistens the Heart and Lungs." 
In Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing-
Cheng notes: "This herb has a flavor that is as sweet as 
Maltosum (yi tang), a harmonious nature, and a moist 
texture-entirely the proper thing to tonify and nourish 
the Spleen yin." 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
::» WITH LYCII FRUCTUS (g6u qi zi) 
While Polygonati Rhizoma (huang jlng) tonifies the qi and 
yin of the Lungs, Spleen, and Kidneys, Lycii Fructus (gou qi 
zi) tonifies the Lung yin, Liver blood, and Kidney essence, 
but also gently warms the Kidney yang. Thus, together 
their range of supplementation is very broad: the yin is 
nourished but the yang is also considered; the qi is tonified 
while the blood benefits; the postnatal Spleen and Stomach 
are supported while the congenital essence of the Kidneys 
is augmented. 
This combination is an excellent gentle tonic for the 
aged or weak, and is best taken over a long period of time 
in small doses that will not be difficult to digest. For this 
purpose, the two herbs can be powdered and made into 
pills with honey. 
Recently, both herbs have been shown to lower blood 
sugar, and have been used as a remedy for type II diabetes, 
although the effects are gradual.

Comparisons 
}> Vs. DIOSCOREAE RHIZOMA (shan yew) 
Both herbs are sweet, tonify the qi, and nourish the yin, 
and are often used in the treatment of deficiency of the 
Lungs, Spleen, and Kidneys. However, Polygonati Rhiz-
oma (huang fing) is moist and more strongly nourishes 
the yin, while Dioscoreae Rhizoma (shan yao) possesses an 
astringent property that restrains and inhibits, and is thus 
more appropriate when qi and yin deficiency involves loss, 
as in diarrhea, vaginal discharge, or spermatorrhea. 
Traditional Contraindications 
When people with yang debility and overabundant yin take 
it, it inevitably leads to diarrhea, focal distention, and sen-
sations of fullness. (Encountering the Sources of the Classic 
of Materia Medica) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "yellow essence" 
Unprepared Polygonati Rhizoma (hudngfing) is tradition-
ally believed to irritate the throat, and so the prepared 
forms are generally used instead. 
}> COOKED POLYGONATUM (1./1, Yi i!* shu hudngjlng) 
In some places the herb is prepared so that it turns black. 
This is also known as prepared polygonatum ( ~ Yi i!* zhl 
huang fing), crow-black polygonatum (.Wv Yi i1* wu huang 
fing), or sweet polygonatum (W Yi i!* tian huangfing). Not 
only does this remove its potential to irritate the throat, it 
also greatly enhances it tonifying property. The process is 
as follows: The newly-harvested rhizome is cleaned of mud 
and thin lateral rootlets, and steamed for one day, after 
which it is left to cool, then dried in the sun for a day. It is 
then steamed, cooled, and dried in the sun again, a process 
which is repeated three or four times, until the interior is 
black, oily, and moist. It is then dried again in the sun, or 
baked at a very low temperature, until completely dry. 
}> WINE-PREPARED PoLYGON A TUM()@ Yi t-k jiu hudngjfng) 
The freshly-harvested rhizome is sealed into a watertight 
container with yellow rice wine, then double-boiled until 
the wine is absorbed and the herb no longer has a numbing 
sensation in the mouth. The container is shaken occasion-
ally to ensure uniform exposure to the wine. This method 
of preparation enhances its tonifying qualities, and reduces 
its greasy nature so that it is not cloying. Owing to the 
wine's acrid, dispersing qualities, which help it unblock 
the channels and collaterals, some regard this method of 
preparation as more appropriate for treating weakness of 
the knees and joint pain. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"If used unprepared, it irritates the throat." (Harm and 
Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists oflarge, thick, solid, and heavy rhi-
zomes, still soft and pliable, with a yellowish brown surface, 
a yellowish white surface on cross section, and a sweet taste. 
Good quality of the prepared herb are large, thick, black, 
soft, sweet, and aromatic rhizomes.

sibiricoside B, neoprazerigenin A 3-0-8-lycotetraoside
