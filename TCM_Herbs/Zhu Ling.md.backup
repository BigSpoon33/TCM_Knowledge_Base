## 📖 Overview

Sweet, bland, and neutral, Polyporus (zhu ling) enters the Kidney and Bladder. It opens the interstices, facilitates the function of the lower orifices, leaches out dampness, and strongly promotes urination. It is used in the treatment of turbid painful urinary dribbling, anuria, and the distention and fullness of edema, damp-heat jaundice, leg qi edema, and chronic diarrhea. According to Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances, Polyporus (zhu ling) is bland in flavor: blandness primarily leaches. It enters the Spleen to unblock the water pathways and is the single fastest treatment for watery diarrhea and damp diarrhea, unblocking painful urinary dribbling and expelling dampness, reducing edema, and treating jaundice.

The Grand Materia Medica notes that it "is bland and leaching; its qi raises but also directs downward; thus, it can open the interstices and pores while facilitating urination."

In Hidden Aspects of Materia Medica, Chen Jia-Mo elaborates: When using it, the black cutis must be removed; it enters the Bladder and Kidney channels to unblock painful urinary dribbling, reduces edematous fullness, expels dampness, and facilitates urination. This is because its bitterness [sic] drains stagnation, while its blandness facilitates the orifices.

Do not use in the absence of dampness.

The Grand Materia Medica quotes from Kou Zong-Shi's Extension of the Materia Medica, which notes that this herb "powerfully mobilizes water; long-term use will certainly injure the Kidney qi and blur the eyes. Those consuming it over an extended period should be particularly cautious." It then proceeds to quote Zhang Yuan-Su, who also warned that this medicinal is "bland and leaching, very drying and exhausts the body fluids; it should not be taken by those without damp disorders."
