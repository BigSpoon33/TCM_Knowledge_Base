EXTERIOR-RELEASING HERBS are those that release 
disorders lodged in the very superficial levels of 
the body. When external pathogenic factors (including 
wind-heat, wind-cold, wind-dampness, and summerheat) 
invade the body, they first attack its superficial, exte-
rior aspects. Symptoms associated with the exterior then 
appear: chills, fever, headache, stiff neck, and general mus-
cle aches. Sometimes sweating will appear, which resolves 
the condition, in which case no treatment is necessary. At 
other times, however, there will be an absence of sweating; 
or, even though there is sweating, it is not be accompanied 
by any change in the condition. At this juncture, herbs that 
release the exterior are used. 
Most exterior-releasing herbs are diaphoretics, that is, 
they release or expel the external pathogenic influences 
through sweating. There is a saying in Chinese medicine, 
"When [the disease] is in the skin, sweating will bring it 
out." 
When a disease progresses slightly further into the 
body it is said to lodge in the muscle layer. The clinical 
presentation then includes fever, general body aches, and 
profuse sweating. At this stage, especially when the patient 
has sweated without any beneficial change in their condi-
tion, it is appropriate to use the subset of herbs that release 
the muscle layer. The most prominent member of this 
group is Cinnamomi Ramulus (gul zhf). 
Some of the herbs that release the exterior have addi-
tional functions: stopping coughs and wheezing, control-
ling pain or spasms, and venting rashes such as measles. In 
Chinese medicine, the treatment of rashes such as measles 
consists of bringing the rash (which is a sign of heat) to 
the surface and venting it, thereby dispersing the disease. 
This is similar to releasing an exterior disorder through 
sweating. Herbs that vent the rash of measles and similar 
3 
diseases are especially useful in cases of relatively long 
duration, when it is believed that the rash is "trapped" in 
the body. 
Section 1 
WARM, ACRID HERBS THAT 
RELEASE THE EXTERIOR 
Herbs that release the exterior can be further divided by 
character and function into warm, acrid and cool, acrid 
classes. The warm, acrid herbs dispel wind-cold and are 
used for exterior disorders when the fever is mild, the 
chills severe, and there are other signs and symptoms of 
wind-cold including headache, body and neck pains, and 
absence of thirst.

CAUTIONS & CONTRAINDICATIONS 
Because this herb has a 
rather strong effect of inducing sweating and opening up 
the Lungs, the dosage should not be too large. Nor should 
it be prescribed, without some adjustment in the prescrip-
tion, for those who are debilitated, those with spontaneous 
sweating from exterior deficiency, those with night sweats 
from yin deficiency, or those with wheezing associated 
with the failure of the Kidneys to accept qi. See ToxiCITY 
below. 
Actions & Indications 
• Induces sweating and releases the exterior: for patterns of 
wind-cold exterior excess (greater yang cold damage) with 
chills, fever, headache, absence of sweating, and a tight, 
floating pulse. This herb is very effective in opening the 
pores and interstices to release the exterior. 
-
With Cinnamomi Ramulus (gul zhl) for patterns of 
wind-cold exterior excess presenting with fever and chills 
but no sweating, as in Ephedra Decoction (mahuang tang). 
Also for wind-cold-damp painful obstruction. 
• Disseminates and facilitates the Lung qi, calms wheezing, 
and stops coughing: for cough and wheezing due to wind-
cold obstructing the Lungs. The herb both encourages the 
Lung qi to flow more easily, and directs it downward. It is 
important for treating either externally-contracted or inter-
nally-generated wheezing. 
-
With Armeniacae Semen (xlng ren) for wind-cold cough 
and wheezing, as in Minor Bluegreen Dragon Decoction 
(xiao qlng 16ng tang) or Three-Unbinding Decoction (san 
ao tang). 
-
With Gypsum fibrosum (shf gao) for cough from heat 
obstructing the Lungs with wheezing and nasal flaring, as in 
Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Gypsum, and Licorice Decoction 
(ma xlng shf gan tang). Often more effective when used 
with Scutellariae Radix (huang qin) and Mori Cortex (sang 
bdi pi). 
-
With Ginseng Radix (ren shen) for wind-cold where 
there is underlying primal qi deficiency. 
• Promotes urination and reduces edema: especially for 
edema that accompanies an exterior condition. 
-
With Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu) for 
acute onset edema, often together with Poriae Cutis (fu ling 
pi) and Mori Cortex (sang bai pi), as in Maidservant from 
Yue Decoction plus Atractylodes (yite bl jia zhu tang). 
• Warms and disperses cold pathogens: useful for wind-
damp painful obstruction and deep-rooted toxic sores 
without a head. 
-
With Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhl fit zi) for 
wind-cold painful obstruction, or exterior cold conditions 
and edema associated with yang deficiency. 
-
With Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu dl huang) for 
deep-rooted toxic sores without a head caused by cold-
dampness obstructing the channels. This combination is 
also used for cough and wheezing associated with Kidney 
yin deficiency, as in Yang-Heartening Decoction (yang he 
tang). 
Note: If heat is generated from the use of Ephedrae Herb a 
(ma huang), Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao) and Scutellariae 
Radix (huang qin) may be added for their cooling effect. 
Commentary 
Ephedrae Herba (ma huang) is strongly acrid, dispers-
ing and warm, and enters the channels of the Lungs and 
Bladder, both of which relate to the exterior of the body. 
The dispersing action of the herb is thus expressed in the 
exterior, by opening up the interstices and pores to induce 
sweating and drive out pathogenic influences. The acrid, 
dispersing action of Ephedrae Herba (ma huang) opens 
up the Lungs to disseminate and facilitate the Lung qi, and 
thus alleviate coughs and calm wheezing. It also enters the 
greater yang, both the channel and the Organ (Bladder). 
This is why the herb is able to release the exterior while 
also promoting urination. As Zhang Xi-Chun observed, 
"Ephedrae Herba (ma huang) treats the pathogen in the 


1 I Herbs that Release the Exterior 
5 
greater yang channel by inducing sweating, and the patho-
gen in the greater yang Organ by releasing it through urina-
tion." 
The acrid, dispersing character ofEphedrae Herba (rna 
huang) is also utlized in other ways. Because it is warm as 
well as strongly dispersing, it can be used to drive out cold 
pathogens in cases of wind-damp painful obstruction, and 
combined with other herbs to expel wind-dampness. 
It is also used for deep-rooted toxic sores without a head 
caused by localized accumulation of dampness (or phlegm) 
and cold, which prevents nourishment from reaching 
the area, and thereby causing a breakdown in the tissues. 
Combined with herbs that restore nourishment, the warm, 
dispersing nature of Ephedrae Herba (rna huang) can be 
instrumental in breaking up the congealing of the gathered 
yin pathogens, thus allowing nourishment to reach the area 
and repair the tissues. Finally, it can be added to external 
medications for the specific purpose of opening the pores 
to allow the medication to be absorbed more quickly. 
When used properly, the warming dispersal ofEphedrae 
Herba (rna huang) can be a powerful and versatile agent, 
but its use requires familiarity with the qualities of the local 
environment and population. A dosage appropriate in one 
place may be excessive in another. Chinese physicians have 
been debating the relationship between locality and dosage 
of this herb for a long time, as reflected in the following 
passage from Lu Jiu-Zhi, quoted by Zhang Xi-Chun in 
Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting 
the Western: 
[For] Ephedrae Herba (rna huang) to promote sweating at 
several tenths of a gram is perhaps possible in southerners, 
but difficult to achieve in the north. The weather is warm 
in the south, the people's skin thin: they sweat easily. Thus, 
a southern proverb warns, 'Ephedrae Herba (mahuang), 
no more than one gram.' In the north, outside the [Great] 
Wall, the climate is freezing, the people's skin tough and 
thick, especially in those who work outside exposed to the 
wind and frost. When it is also in the middle of winter, 
then a sweat could only be produced if repeated doses of 
20 grams or more are used. Thus, the Way of Herbs values 
adapting the approach in accordance with the time, place, 
and people, adroitly changing with the circumstances, and 
not hobbled by set views [about dosage]. 
Li Shi-Zhen also provided some advice regarding the man-
agement of common, mild reactions to this herb: 
If ingestion ofEphedrae Herba (mahuang) causes continu-
ous spontaneous sweating, use cold water to soak the scalp, 
then pat Ephedrae Radix (mahuang gen) powder over the 
area of sweating and it will stop. After using any medi-
cine containing Ephedrae Herba (rna huang), drafts must 
be avoided for one day, otherwise the illness will recur. 
The problem of red eyes can be avoided by always using 
Scutellariae Radix (huang qfn) as an accompaniment to 
Ephedrae Herba (rna huang). 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
>
WITH CINNAMOMI RAMULUS (gul zhi) 
Both of these herbs are acrid and warm, and both enter 
the greater yang channel. The combination is used when 
pathogenic cold has attacked and lodged in the exterior, 
especially in winter. Ephedrae Herba (rna huang) travels 
best at the protective level; it strongly disperses cold by 
promoting sweating. Cinnamomi Ramulus (gul zhi) moves 
best at the nutritive level, where it warms the channels and 
releases the muscle layer, but its sweat-inducing action 
is much less than that of Ephedrae Herba (rna huang). 
The diaphoretic effect of Ephedrae Herba (rna huang) is 
enhanced by the addition of Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui 
zhi), and the latter can lead a pathogen lodged at the nutri-
tive level out to the exterior, where it is dispersed. 
When using this combination, caution must be exer-
cised to prevent excessive sweating, which could injure the 
qi and fluids. However, one must be equally careful not to 
induce less sweating than needed, since this will have no 
effect. Generally, pathogenic cold lodged in the exterior 
requires only a mild sweat to release it, but the intensity of 
the sweating required depends upon an evaluation of the 
strength of the patient and the strength of the pathogen. 
A strong patient with a strong wind-cold pathogen 
requires Ephedrae Herba (rna huang) at twice the dose 
of Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui zhi), as in Major Bluegreen 
Dragon Decoction (da qzng long tang). If the dose is equal, 
or there is only slightly more Ephedrae Herba (rna huang), 
there will be a moderate sweating effect. More Cinnamomi 
Ramulus (gul zhi) than Ephedrae Herba (rna huang) induc-
es only a slight sweat, which is often useful in treating older 
or weaker patients, who may also benefit from combining 
these herbs in lower dosages, as in Two-parts Cinnamon 
Twig Decoction and One-part Ephedra Decoction (gui zh! 
er rna huang tang). 
> WrTH ARMENIACAE SEMEN (xlngren) 
Both herbs enter the Lung channel and excel at alleviating 
cough and calming wheezing. However, their mechanisms 
of action differ. Ephedrae Herba (rna huang) disseminates 
and facilitates the flow of Lung qi, while Armeniacae 
Semen (xlng ren) primarily drains and directs the Lung qi 
downward. Because these various actions exactly match 
the Lung's own movements in disseminating and moving 
downward, this pair can restore normal Lung function and 
so is frequently found in ancient formulas. For example, 
in Records of Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica, 
Zhou Yan offers this explanation: 
Armeniacae Semen (xlng ren) is known as the 'right hand' 
of Ephedrae Herba (rna huang). Ephedrae Herba (rna 


6 
1 I Herbs that Release the Exterior 
hudng) unbinds the muscle layer, while Armeniacae Semen 
(xlng n!n) opens the collaterals of the Lungs. Ephedrae 
Herba ( md hudng) is hard by nature, while Armeniacae 
Semen (xlng ren) is soft. Ephedrae Herba (md hudng) 
spreads externally, while Armeniacae Semen (xlng ren) 
directs downward internally. When the two are combined, 
the pathogen is completely eliminated. 
As this passage suggests, regardless of whether a pattern is 
hot or cold, this combination is still useful, with the appro-
priate additions. What is more, because Ephedrae Herba 
(rna huang) and Armeniacae Semen (xing ren) also release 
the exterior, the pair is strong enough to use as a two-herb 
formula when a wind-cold exterior pattern is causing 
cough, sensations of fullness in the chest, and wheezing. 
>WITH REHMANNIAE RADIX PREP ARATA (shu dl huang) 
This combination benefits the Kidneys while calming 
wheezing. It is most suitable when the Kidney qi is not 
secure and cannot accept qi, which manifests as chronic 
wheezing characterized by difficult inhalation with pro-
longed exhalation. The patient is often emaciated and 
fatigued. The Lungs control the qi, while the Kidneys 
are its root. Thus, if the Kidneys are weak and have dif-
ficulty accepting inhaled qi, the qi will not remain stable 
at the deeper levels (below the navel) but instead will rebel 
upward with wheezing. Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shU 
di huang) nourishes the true yin, generates essence, blood, 
and primal qi, thus enhancing the Kidney's ability to accept 
the inhaled qi. Ephedrae Herba (rna huang) helps the Lungs 
redirect the qi downward instead of accumulating in the 
upper body, and so settles the wheezing. 
Together these herbs also warm and unblock the chan-
nels and collaterals. Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu dl 
huang) is tranquil and nourishing, while Ephedrae Herba 
(rna huang) is mobilizing: it can enter deeply into accumu-
lated phlegm and blood stagnation. This is an illustration of 
the adage "tranquility requires movement for motivation." 
This combination can be used in the treatment of cold from 
defiency in the nutritive level blood, where cold, congealed 
phlegm has stagnated and caused deep-rooted toxic sores 
without a head, as in Yang-Heartening Decoction (yang 
he tang). 
>WITH GINSENG RADIX (ren shen) 
Ephedrae Herba (md huang) has a strong dispersing action, 
possibly too strong for those with externally-contracted 
wind-cold who also have weak primal qi or temporary 
qi deficiency due to overwork. Ginseng Radix (ren shen) 
restores the primal qi so that the dispersing action of 
Ephedrae Herba (md huang) will be able to dispel the 
pathogen without inducing profuse or continuous sweat-
ing. Ginseng Radix (ren shen) is the most fitting of the qi-
supplementing herbs to prescribe with Ephedrae Herba 
(md huang). Astragali Radix (huang qf) is less suitable, for 
although it also tonifies the primal qi, it tends to secure the 
exterior and work against the action of Ephedrae Herba 
(rna huang). Codonopsis Radix (dang shen) tonifies the 
Spleen qi rather than the primal qi, and would therefore 
also not be the best choice. 
One occasionally hears the statement that "tonifying 
herbs should not be used with exterior patterns" for fear of 
strengthening the pathogen. In Precepts for Physicians, Yu 
Chang discusses this at length. He concludes that this is a 
problem only if there is no existing deficiency, as there is 
then nowhere for the tonification to be received other than 
by the pathogen. However, if there is significant deficiency, 
tonification is indicated and there is no impediment to its 
use: 
There are situations of cold damage where Ginseng Radix 
(ren shen) should be included in the prescription: the pri-
mal qi will then flourish and the external pathogen will be 
carried outward by its power. If the person's primal qi is 
weak, even though the [force of the] herbs themselves move 
toward the exterior, the qi remains passively in the middle. 
In mild cases, a pathogen will be half expelled, leaving half 
to remain and cause difficulties; a severe pathogen will fol-
low the primal qi as it withdraws inward, causing endless 
fevers. Thus, weak deficient people must have Ginseng 
Radix (ren shen) in with their exterior [releasing] herbs: it 
makes the herbs powerful so that, with a single gush, the 
pathogen is thrust out. This is definitely not a matter of 
'tonification'. 
>WITH GYPSUM FIBROSUM (shf gao) 
Both are acrid, dispersing and enter the Lungs, but Ephedrae 
Herba (rna huang) is warm and works on the exterior while 
Gypsum fibrosum (shf gao) is very cold and works more 
deeply at the muscle layer and interior. Together they act 
strongly to disseminate the Lung qi, cool the heat, and calm 
the wheezing, and are particularly appropriate for exterior 
pathogens which have moved internally, transformed into 
heat, and clogged the Lungs. This pattern presents with 
such symptoms as prolonged fever, cough, and wheezing. 
This pair of herbs is the basis for the formula Ephedra, 
Apricot Kernel, Gypsum, and Licorice Decoction (rna xing 
shf gan tang). 
Beyond this, Gypsum fibrosum (shf gao) can lead 
Ephedrae Herba (rna huang) to the interior while moder-
ating its sweat-inducing effect; the Gypsum fibrosum (shf 
gao) itself clears heat which is trapped within pathogenic 
water and dampness. The pair is thus highly effective in 
treating wind-edema. However, the dosage of Ephedrae 
Herba (rna huang) must be greater than normal in this case, 
between 10 to lSg, in order to move fluids, while the dosage 


1 I Herbs that Release the Exterior 
7 
of Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao) is somewhat smaller than 
normal, 20-30g being sufficient. 
::o> WITH GINKGo SEMEN (bai guo); see page 894 
Traditional Contraindications 
Its nature is light, lifting, and very dispersing, and is most 
rapid at releasing the exterior ... excessive sweating devas-
tates yang and can endanger a person's life- be on guard! 
From the end of spring through summer until the begin-
ning of autumn, the standard approach is to forbid it; only 
in the winter when symptoms appear, showing that a truly 
cold pathogen has injured the nutritive [level], is it of ben-
efit. If not during the winter months, or the symptoms are 
not those of a cold pathogen, or are those of a cold patho-
gen in the interior, or those of pathogenic wind injuring the 
protective [level], then Ephedrae Herba (md huang) is not 
suitable, even though there may be fever and chills: there 
will not be aching and stiffness of the head and body, and 
no floating and tightness in the six pulse positions. 
When the condition is right for sweating, it must not be 
excessive. Sweat is the fluid of the Heart, excessive sweating 
will agitate the Heart blood, or cause great loss of yang, or 
cause bleeding- and this then becomes a major affliction. 
(Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
This herb contains central nervous system stimulants and 
may cause high blood pressure, restlessness, and insomnia. 
It should be used with caution in treating patients with high 
blood pressure. Do not use in conjunction with cardiac gly-
cosides, as cardiac arrhythmias may occur. Allergic reac-
tions in the form of cutaneous eruptions combined with 
slightly elevated temperature and measles-like erythema 
have been reported. Because ephedrine stimulates the 
sphincter muscle of the bladder, long-term administration 
may cause oliguria or anuresis. 
The toxic dose is approximately 30-45g. Symptoms 
of acute toxic reaction include palpitations, insomnia, 
restlessness, diaphoresis, chest pain, elevated temperature, 
and tremor. Extreme overdoses can lead to blurred vision, 
dilated pupils, coma, dyspnea, dysuria, convulsions, respi-
ratory arrest, cardiac failure, bradycardia, and ventricular 
fibrillation. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "hemp yellow" 
}> CLEANED EPHEDRA ( )f fiM, ~ jlng mahuang) 
This has the nodes on the stalks removed, as well as the 
roots, as both are generally considered to reduce the herb's 
diaphoretic effect. The nodes can be left if the herb is not 
to be used to induce sweating. For example, the formu-
la Three-Unbinding Decoction (san iio tang) specifically 
calls for Ephedrae Herba (ma huang) without the nodes 
removed, since the desired effect is to disseminate the Lung 
qi and calm wheezing, rather than sweating. 
}> EPHEDRA COTTON (fiM, ~ -~ mahuang r6ng) 
Cleaned ephedra is brought to a boil until it 'rolls over' 
in the water ten times, or simply infused in boiling water 
until froth rises; it is then removed and dried. Once dried, 
it is ground until the fibers become soft. It is then called 
ephedra cotton. 
Usually, when cleaned ephedra is used to promote 
sweating, the patient first boils it, then removes the froth, 
as it can cause agitation. Ephedra cotton saves this trouble. 
The diaphoretic effect, however, is slightly less than cleaned 
ephedra, while stronger than prepared ephedra. 
::o> PREPARED EPHEDRA ( ~J+,fc W zhi mahuang) 
Cleaned ephedra is stir-fried with water. This method of 
preparation reduces the herb's diaphoretic action, but 
strengthens its effect in calming the Lungs. Discussion 
of Cold Damage says to remove the froth after boiling. 
According to Materia Medica of Combinations, this is 
because the froth "makes one irritable"; however, "frying 
with honey before use will also work." 
}> HONEY-PREPARED EPHEDRA 
('§i ~pij, ~ mi zhi md huang) 
Honey is first brought to a boil slowly, and the froth and 
any residual wax or extraneous material scraped from the 
surface. The honey is then poured through a filter. It is 
returned to the wok, and again brought to a boil, which is 
maintained at 116-118°C until the whole wok bubbles and 
the honey no longer stretches between the fingers. 
Boiling water is then added to thin the honey, which is 
then poured slowly over cleaned ephedra and left covered 
briefly. The amount of cooked honey should be approxi-
mately one-fifth the amount of herb, while the amount of 
water should be approximately one-third the quantity of 
honey; too much water and the herb will become overly 
damp and difficult to dry after preparation. The herb is 
then dry-fried at a low temperature until deep yellow and 
no longer sticky to the touch. 
When ephedra is prepared with honey, the diaphoresis 
is modified by the sweetness of the honey. Not only is the 
intensity of its acrid, dispersing qualities moderated, but 
the duration of its action is lengthened in a kind of 'time-
release' manner. Sweetness pertains to the earth phase and 
thus brings harmony. Honey preparation also moistens 
the Lungs and protects this tender Organ from the drying 
effects of the acrid, warm qualities of the unprepared herb.
