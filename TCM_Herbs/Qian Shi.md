## 📖 Overview

Sweet, astringent, and neutral, Euryales Semen (qian shi) tonifies and restrains the Spleen and Kidneys, while eliminating dampness. Thus it is particularly effective for vaginal discharge due to Spleen and Kidney deficiency. It secures the essence to treat spermatorrhea, stops chronic diarrhea, and contains urinary incontinence due to loss of Bladder control. *Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica* describes the therapeutic scope of this herb:

How can Euryales Semen (qian shi) tonify the Spleen? It is due to its sweet flavor. How can it stabilize the Kidneys? Its astringency. It is only its sweet tonification of the Spleen that enables it to facilitate [removal of] dampness, thus treating diarrhea and abdominal pain; it is only its astringent stabilization of the Kidneys that enables it to close up [the Kidney and Bladder] qi, so that leaking vaginal discharge and dribbling urine are both cured.

*The Grand Materia Medica* says that it "alleviates thirst, augments the Kidneys, treats urinary incontinence, spermatorrhea, cloudy urine, and vaginal discharge."

*New Compilation of Materia Medica*, Chen Shi-Duo says that it

may appear unremarkable, but it is highly beneficial. Most herbs that tonify the Kidneys are moist, and thus inevitably contribute somewhat to the dampness. Euryales Semen (qian shi) tonifies the middle and eliminates dampness, but its nature is not drying, so it can expel pathogenic water while tonifying the true water. If it is used with other yin tonifying herbs, it notably assists in the supplementation of essence, without any fear of increasing the dampness.

The northern Song poet, administrator, and polymath Su Shi (also known as Su from the Eastern Slope, or Su Dong-Po), who was no mean physician in his own right, developed an elegantly simple combination of diet therapy and qi gong that he claimed contributed to his own longevity and continued effectiveness into old age. This prescription was noted in his *Jottings from the Eastern Slope* and involves boiling 10-20 seeds of Euryales Semen (qian shi), after which they are slowly and finely chewed, one by one. If done every day, he says, "this is sufficient to circulate the water of the upper pool, so that those who eat Euryale Semen (qian shi) can make the essential fluids (jing ye) flow unceasingly."
