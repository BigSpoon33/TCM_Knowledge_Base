## 📖 Overview

Bitter, astringent, slightly cold, Platycladi Cacumen (ce bai ye) enters the Liver, Lung, and Large Intestine channels. Bitterness dries dampness, astringency inhibits and restrains, and its slight coldness cools what is hot; thus, this herb cools the blood and inhibits bleeding. It also promotes hair growth and dries dampness to stop vaginal discharge. It can be used when heat in the blood leads to the coughing or expectoration of blood, blood in the stool or urine, and for irregular uterine bleeding. It cools the Lungs and expels phlegm, and applied topically can assist in the healing of burns, and promote the regrowth of hair in cases of balding, for which it is also taken internally.

Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians states that this herb "governs the vomiting of blood, nosebleed, bleeding dysenteric disorder, continuous vaginal bleeding and vaginal discharge; expels damp painful obstruction and generates flesh."

## ⚡ Functions & Actions

Cools the blood and stops bleeding: Widely used for various bleeding disorders including vomiting blood, bleeding gums, coughing of blood, blood in the stool or urine, bloody dysenteric disorder, and uterine bleeding. Owing to its slightly cold nature, this herb is effectively used in treating patterns of hot blood, but it may also be used with warming herbs for bleeding associated with cold patterns.
    - With Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) for many forms of hemorrhage resulting from the chaotic movement of hot blood.
    - With Cirsii Herba (xiao ji) and Cirsii japonici Herba sive Radix (da ji) for nosebleed with bright red blood due to heat forcing the blood upward. Can also be used for blood in the urine.
    - With Artemisiae argyi Folium (ai ye) and Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jiang) for bleeding associated with cold from deficiency, as in Oriental Arborvitae Leafy Twig Decoction (bai ye tang).
    - With Typhae Pollen (pu huang) for excessive uterine bleeding due to heat.
    - With Codonopsis Radix (dang shen) and Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui) for excessive uterine bleeding with manifestations of both qi and blood deficiency.
- Stops cough and expels phlegm: For Lung heat patterns with cough and accumulation of phlegm. Especially important in cases of viscous, difficult-to-expectorate sputum streaked with blood.
    - With Jujubae Fructus (da zao) for chronic hot cough, especially of the dry, nonproductive variety.
- Promotes healing of burns: Used topically in powdered form for the early stages of burns over a small to moderate surface area. Also used for hair loss.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Must be combined with appropriate herbs for bleeding with deficiency.
Cold and drying by nature, [Platycladi Cacumen (ce bai ye)] greatly cuts down Stomach [qi]; although it can stop bleeding, it has no power to generate yang, therefore deficient patients who have lost blood should not take it without prescription.
