the body. Also for focal distention in the chest and epigas-
trium. 
-
With Coptidis Rhizoma (huang ficin) and Trichosanthis 
Fructus (guii l6u) for clumping of phlegm and heat in

Commentary 
Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhl ban xia) is acrid, warm, 
and toxic if untreated, and enters the Spleen and Stomach 
channels. It is especially dispersing and drying, and because 
it is slippery and directs rebellious qi downward, it restores 
the normal descent of Stomach qi when it is rebelling 
upward. It eliminates water and dampness, both by drying 
and by dispersing; and through its ability to direct qi down-
ward, it harmonizes the Stomach and stops nausea, hie-
cough, and a sensation of fullness in the hypochondrium. 
Thus, Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhl ban xia) is most 
often used for treating Spleen dampness producing profuse, 
clear, thin sputum with cough, or phlegm and dampness 
rising upward causing palpitations, insomnia, vertigo, and 
loss of mental clarity, or the previously mentioned Stomach 
symptoms. Because of its efficacy in directing rebellious qi 
downward and transforming phlegm, it is often combined 
with other substances for treating cough and dyspnea from 
phlegm-dampness and heat, or nausea from Stomach heat 
or weakness, morning sickness, and phlegm-dampness 
entering the collaterals and causing nodes of phlegm. 
The slipperiness (.U if tf huci) of this herb has been 
the subject of comment by many authors, including Li Shi-
Zhen, who noted in the Grand Materia Medica: 
The reason that Pinelliae Rhizoma (ban xia) governs 
phlegm and thin mucus with abdominal distention is that 
its form is slippery, its flavor acrid, and its nature warm: 
the slipperiness moistens the phlegm, and the acrid warmth 
disperses and also moistens; thus, it promotes [elimination 
of] dampness and unblocks stool, facilitates [proper func-
tioning of the] orifices and drains urination, and thus it is 
said that 'the acrid mobilizes qi to transform phlegm' -this 
is the use of acridity to moisten. 
Zhang Yuan-Su provided a concise guide for combining 
other herbs with this one: 
For phlegm-heat, combine with Scutellariae Radix (huang 
qfn). For wind-phlegm, combine with Arisaema cum Bile 
(dan nan xing). For cold-phlegm, combine with Zingiberis 
Rhizoma (giin jiiing). For phlegm obstructing the epigas-
trium, combine with Citri reticulatae Pericarpium (chen 
pi) and Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu). 
Excessive use drains the Spleen and Stomach. 
Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica 
identified a limitation in the use of this herb: "only inap-
propriate for treating parched, dry phlegm [Pinelliae 
Rhizoma preparatum (zhl ban xia)]; that should be treated 
instead with Trichosanthis Fructus (guii l6u) and Fritillar-
iae Bulbus (bei mu)." 
Zhang Shan-Lei contributed a useful mnemonic: 
The best aspects ofPinelliae Rhizoma (ban xia) can be 
summed up in four characters: opening (r,fl kiii), dissemi-
nating(~ xuiin), slippery ()it hua), and downward-direct-
ing (ri~· Jiang). The reason that it can eliminate turbidity 
and phlegm is simply its actions in opening, draining, and 
slipping downward. 
The herbal antidote to poisoning from unprepared Pinel-
liae Rhizoma (sheng ban xia) is a decoction of Zingiberis 
Rhizoma recens (sheng jiiing) 30g, Saposhnikoviae Radix 
(jcingfeng) 60g, and Glycyrrhizae Radix (giin cao) lSg. 
It is interesting to note that this herb was prescribed for 
insomnia as early as the Divine Pivot (Chapter 10), where it 
is combined with sorghum (~AUf- shu ml). The mechanism 
of the insomnia there is described as an internal pathogen 
preventing the protective qi from entering and circulating 
at night, as it normally should. This combination of herbs 
is said to unblock the yin and yang. Modern interpreta-
tions of this formula often explain that Pinelliae Rhizoma 
preparatum (zhl ban xia) here dries dampness and thereby 
improves the transportive functions of the Spleen such that 
the turbid phlegm does not obstruct the movement of the 
yang into the yin. This combination can be used for insom-
nia characterized by racing thoughts when accompanied by 
Stomach symptoms. 


6 I Herbs that Transform Phlegm and Stop Coughing 
415 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
~ WITH CITRI RETICULATAE PERICARPIUM (chen pi) 
Both herbs are acrid, warm, and enter the Stomach, and 
both dry dampness and transform phlegm. Traditionally, 
the aged product of each is most prized, which accounts 
for the name given to the pair: 'two-cured' ( -=-F.f.. er chen, 
cured by aging). This is an interestingly and subtle combi-
nation in that Citri reticulatae Pericarpium (chen pi) pri-
marily moves the qi, but also dries dampness and alleviates 
nausea, while Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhl ban xia) 
primarily transforms phlegm, but also directs rebellious qi 
downward and thereby alleviates nausea. 
Together the restored movement of qi induced by Citri 
reticulatae Pericarpium (chen pi) promotes the spontane-
ous resolution of phlegm. This conforms with the ancient 
adage, "Those who excel at treating phlegm first treat the 
qi." The transformation of phlegm by Pinelliae Rhizoma 
preparatum (zhl ban xia) facilitates the smooth flow of 
qi. Once this occurs, the transportive and transformative 
functions of the Spleen and Stomach will be restored, and 
the middle burner will no longer produce phlegm. That is 
the reason that this combination is the basis for dozens of 
phlegm-resolving formulas. 
~ WITH PoGOSTEMONIS/AGASTACHES HERBA (hub xiiing) 
Both are Spleen and Stomach herbs. Pogostemonis/ 
Agastaches Herba (hub xiiing) is fragrant and excels at 
transforming turbid dampness to improve Spleen func-
tion, unbind the middle burner, promote the flow of qi, 
harmonize the Stomach, and alleviate nausea. Together the 
yang-expanding fragrance of Pogostemonis/ Agastaches 
Herba (hub xiiing) breaks up thick, turbid dampness, while 
the warmth of Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhl ban xia) 
dries and directs the dampness downward. They work 
synergistically in treating turbid dampness in the Spleen 
and Stomach. Common manifestations include nausea, 
lethargy, loss of appetite, poor concentration, and a swol-
len, pale tongue with a greasy, white coating. 
In addition, Pogostemonis/ Agastaches Herb a (hub 
xiiing) releases summertime turbid dampness. It is there-
fore often combined with Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum 
(zhl ban xia) for the fever, lethargy, vomiting, and diarrhea 
associated with summerheat. 
~ WITH PoRIA (jU ling) 
This is another frequently used combination for treating 
phlegm, thin mucus, and turbid dampness. Poria (fu ling) 
is sweet and bland. Its sweetness tonifies the Spleen, while 
its blandness leaches out dampness and pathogenic water. 
If dampness is prevented from accumulating, it will not 
produce phlegm, and the Spleen will not become overbur-
dened. Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhl ban xia) is acrid 
and dispersing; its warmth dries and transforms dampness. 
The use of this herb thereby enables the Spleen to enjoy a 
healthy dryness, which likewise prevents the formation of 
phlegm. Combined, while Poria (fu ling) treats the root of 
the phlegm by tonifying the Spleen and leaching out damp-
ness, Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhl ban xia) alleviates 
the branch manifestation of nausea by directing the qi 
downward, and simultaneously assists the yang-natured 
transformation of dampness and phlegm through its warm 
and acrid nature. 
The use of this pair of herbs has the additional benefit 
of preventing turbid phlegm and dampness from disturb-
ing the residence of the spirit-the Heart-which is located 
just above the Stomach. The mild, spirit-calming action of 
Poria (fu ling) enhances this effect. 
This explains the wide range of syn1ptoms addressed 
by this combination: nausea, vomiting of fluids, hiccough, 
dizziness, palpitations, insomnia from mental rumina-
tion, cough with profuse, clear phlegm, and loose, watery 
stools. 
~ WITH MAGNOLIAE OFFICINALIS CORTEX (hbu pb) 
Both of these herbs dry dampness and transform phlegm, 
direct qi downward, and dissolve focal distention. But it 
is Magnoliae officinalis Cortex (hbu pb) which focuses on 
drying dampness and pacifying the Stomach, eliminating 
blockage and distention, and directing qi downward to 
calm wheezing. Together, Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum 
(zhl ban xia) treats phlegm and dampness, while Magnoliae 
officinalis Cortex (hbu pb) treats qi blockage; the pair is 
therefore good for opening clumped phlegm and qi when 
they have combined to form an obstruction. Symptoms 
associated with this disorder include a sensation of fullness 
in the chest with coughing and wheezing, nausea, vomiting, 
and a sensation of distention in the hypochondrium. 
This combination of herbs is also well-known for its 
ability to break up plum-pit qi, a sensation of obstruction 
in the iliroat which doesn't actually impede swallowing. 
This is, in fact, another example of clumped qi-phlegm.

Comparisons 
~ Vs. PoRIA (fu ling) 
Both herbs expel phlegm-dampness, but Pinelliae Rhizoma 


416 
6 I Herbs that Transform Phlegm and Stop Coughing 
preparatum (zh! bcm xia) dries and transforms phlegm, 
draining the branch manifestation-the visible phlegm-
while Poria (ju ling) strengthens the Spleen, expels damp-
ness, and transforms phlegm-the root of the problem. 
Together, both the root and branch are addressed. 
>- Vs. ZINGIBERIS RHIZOMA RECENS (shengjiiing) 
Both of these herbs are ideal for harmonizing the Stomach 
and settling the nausea. However, Pinelliae Rhizoma pre-
paratum (zhl ban xia) tends to dry dampness and dis-
perse phlegm and thin mucus in order to stop the nausea, 
while Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jiiing) warms the 
Stomach and awakens the Spleen in order to harmonize 
the Stomach and settle the nausea. They are used together 
for cold-dampness injuring the Stomach and leading to 
nausea. 
Both herbs are also good for alleviating cough, but 
again, Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhl ban xia) tends 
to dry dampness and transform phlegm, while Zingiberis 
Rhizoma recens (sheng jiiing) warms the Lungs and trans-
forms thin mucus to stop the cough. They are often com-
bined for cold-phlegm induced cough with thin, profuse 
mucus. IfZingiberis Rhizoma (giin jiiing) is used, the Lung-
warming action is even stronger.

Traditional Contraindications 
Traditionally, it was forbidden to combine this herb with 
any of the various forms of aconite. 
Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica provides a 
discussion of the contraindications of this herb, noting that 
it is 
drying by nature and acrid, warm, and toxic. Although it 
can expel dampness, separate water, and strengthen the 
Spleen, as well as open constrained clumped phlegm due to 
cold-damp qi, those conditions for which it is forbidden are 
nought but yin deficiency, lack of blood, and insufficiency 
of yin and yang fluids. Thus, the ancients established its 
prohibition as applying to patients with chronic bleeding, 
chronic thirst, or chronic sweating ... but beyond these 
three, the areas for which it should be restricted are numer-
ous. 
The text then proceeds with a discussion of a variety of 
symptoms, the less obvious of which include: 
sore throat from yin deficiency with fire flaring, rather 
than from cold damage; lesser yin disorders with wheezing 
and failure of pathogenic heat to be released, but due to qi 
deficiency, rather than from constraint of wind-cold; head-
ache due to blood deficiency rather than phlegm collapse; 
insomnia due to Heart channel blood deficiency, rather 
than from Gallbladder deficiency following an illness. 
These contraindications are both cautionary and instruc-
tive. 
Toxicity 
Pinelliae Rhizoma (sheng ban xia) is toxic, and only the 
processed herb is for internal use. Toxic reactions may 
occur after ingestion of the unprocessed drug (toxic dose: 
O.l-2.4g) or overdosage of the prepared drug. It causes 
severe irritation of the mucosa of the mouth, pharynx, and 
gastrointestinal tract, and has toxic effects on the nervous 
system. Symptoms of toxicity include dry mouth, numb-
ness of the tongue, gastric discomfort, burning sensa-
tion and swelling of the mouth, tongue, and throat, and 
salivation. In more severe cases the patient may experience 
hoarseness, spasms, dyspnea, and even asphyxia. Note that 
the herb acts synergistically with barbiturates. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "prepared half summer" 
The derivation of this name is thought to be related to the 
herb's harvest in mid-summer, which is to say, halfway 
through the season. 
>- UNPREPARED PINELLI A (.'£-f. l, sheng ban xia)-
PHARMACEUTICAL NAME: PINELLIAE RHIZOMA 
In its raw form, pinellia is generally considered too toxic for 
internal use. Therefore, if only the words -f. I. ban xia are 
written in a prescription, one of the prepared forms will be 
dispensed, usually either ginger pinellia or standard pinel-
lia (see below). For this reason, unless otherwise specifically 
stated in the source texts, we will always refer to this herb as 
prepared pinellia, with the pharmaceutical name Pinelliae 
Rhizoma preparatum (~-f. I. zhl ban xia). Note that any 
pinellia product that instantly irritates the throat when a 
small amount is tasted still has a degree of toxicity. If the 
herb is nevertheless still used, ginger must be added to the 
prescription. The unprepared product should not be taken 
orally, as explained below. 
If raw pinellia is desired, this must be specified by writ-
ing .1. -f. I. (sheng ban xia), which is usually indicated only 
in prescriptions for external application. External uses for 
raw pinellia range from the ancient method of puffing the 
powder into the nose for treating coma, fainting, childhood 
convulsions, or swollen painful obstruction of the throat, 
to the contemporary uses of eliminating the swelling of 
boils and goiter, stopping pain, and treating skin diseases. 


6 I Herbs that Transform Phlegm and Stop Coughing 
417 
Ge Sheng (late Yuan dynasty) noted that "When presented 
with a case of sudden collapse, the patient will revive when 
powdered Pinelliae Rhizoma (bim xia) is blown into their 
nose for the purpose of eliciting a sneeze." 
It should be noted that some practitioners continue 
to use the raw herb internally. For example, Cao Ying-Fu, 
the early twentieth-century expert on Zhang Zhong-Jing's 
formulas, pointed out that Zhang's books only called 
for pinellia to be washed, not treated. He, and others 
who were influenced by him (including Zhang Ci-Gong), 
used the raw form for serious cases of vomiting, such as 
severe morning sickness. In such cases the herb must be 
finely crushed and soaked in ginger juice for at least twenty 
minutes before decocting. Often, it is decocted first, and 
only after the decoction has lost its sharp taste will the 
other herbs be added. However, in view of its toxicity (see 
ToxiCITY above), this practice cannot be recommended. 
);;>- GINGER PINELLI A (:j -'f- l_ jiang ban xia) 
The herb is soaked and rinsed until it has only a slightly 
spicy, numbing taste, then it is boiled with fresh ginger and 
alum until cooked through. It is then dried in the open 
until60-70 percent dry, moistened again to slice, then dried 
completely. This form is also known as l I. jiang xia or i1 
I.~ jiang xia pian. 
There is some variation in the nomenclature. In some 
places the term ginger pinellia is used for unprepared pinel-
lia that is simply boiled, fried, or steamed with fresh ginger, 
without any additional herbs. In other places, instead of 
alum, materials such as Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cao), 
Natrii Sulfas (mdng xiiio), or Gleditsiae Fructus (zao jid) are 
boiled with the pinellia. 
Once prepared with ginger, the toxicity of the pinellia 
is reduced and its nature is changed from fiercely acrid and 
hot to warm and drying, with the ability to dry dampness, 
transform phlegm, direct qi downward, and alleviate nau-
sea. It is best used for either phlegm and thin mucus from 
Spleen deficiency, or for cold-phlegm causing cough and 
rebellious qi. 
);;>- STANDARD PINELLIA (it;-f- l_ fa ban xia) 
Raw pinellia is soaked and rinsed until only a slightly spicy, 
numbing taste remains. It is then mixed evenly in a decoc-
tion of Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cao) and lime, and soaked 
until the center becomes yellow without any remaining 
white and the originally powdery herb becomes horn-like 
and semitransparent. This is also known simply as ii: I. fa 
xia, or 8: ii: l. jzngfa xia ('capital standard pinellia'). Note 
that in some areas of China, Gleditsiae Fructus (zao jid), 
Natrii Sulfas (mdng xiiio), and Citri reticulatae Pericarpium 
(chen pi) are used instead of Glycyrrhizae Radix (giin cao) 
and lime. 
The drying action of standard pinellia is somewhat 
more moderate than that of other forms, and it is often 
used for Spleen deficiency encumbered by dampness and 
internal retention of phlegm and thin mucus. Because it is 
less fiercely drying, it can be used for treating patterns of 
both cold from deficiency as well as damp-heat. 
);;>- CLEARWATER P INELLI A (~t 7)(. f- l_ qzng shui ban xia) 
Raw pinellia is soaked and rinsed until only a slightly spicy, 
numbing taste remains. It is then slightly dried, then boiled 
with alum and water until the center is no longer white. It is 
then dried and pulverized, or allowed to partially dry, and is 
then sliced. This greatly reduces its acrid, drying properties, 
which makes it more appropriate for weak patients with 
copious phlegm and relatively mild cold and dampness.
