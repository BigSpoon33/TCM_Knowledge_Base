## 📖 Overview

*Di Fu Zi* (Kochiae Fructus) is acrid, bitter, and cold; it clears, facilitates, dredges, and disperses. It primarily enters the Bladder channel, which governs the exterior of the body, and also the lower outlet of the fluid pathways. Kochiae (*di fu zi*) Fructus mobilizes the exterior and thus alleviates itching by dispersing pathogenic wind in the muscle layer and skin. It also clears damp-heat internally and facilitates urination. Thus, it is often used, both internally and externally, for intense itching of the skin due to wind-dampness affecting the exterior in such disorders as eczema and scabies, or damp-heat in the genitals.

This herb is commonly used for urinary difficulty that is dark, scanty, burning, and painful due to accumulated damp-heat in the Bladder. Its ability to clear wind-heat enables it to treat swollen, painful eyes and head, or dizziness.
