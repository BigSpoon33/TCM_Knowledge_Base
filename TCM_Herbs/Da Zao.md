## 📖 Overview

Sweet, moistening, and harmonious, *Jujubae Fructus* (da zao) tonifies both the qi and blood, generates fluids, restores harmony to the nutritive and protective qi, and moderates the toxic effects of relatively harsh herbs. All of this is accomplished through its support for the harmonizing quality of earth: the Spleen and Stomach. In Chapter 70 of the *Basic Questions*, this herb is cataloged as a fruit relating to earth. According to Li Shi-Zhen, this means that it should be taken for Spleen disorders; more specifically, it is "an herb of the Spleen channel blood level." Li Gao notes that its nature is "warm to tonify Spleen channel insufficiency, sweet to moderate yin blood, [and thereby] harmonizes the yin and yang, adjusts the nutritive and protective levels, and generates yin fluids and yang fluids."

The *Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica* classifies the jujube as a superior medicinal:

[It] governs pathogenic qi in the Heart and abdomen, quiets the middle, nourishes the Spleen, and assists the twelve channels. Calms Stomach qi, unblocks the nine orifices, tonifies diminished qi and lack of fluids, any insufficiency in the body, intense jitteriness, heaviness of the extremities, and harmonizes the hundred medicinals.

*Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica* elaborates, noting that it

is sweet so that it tonifies the middle, warm so that it augments the qi. When the Spleen and Stomach are tonified, the twelve channels are unblocked naturally, the nine orifices are facilitated, and the four extremities are harmonized. When the normal qi is sufficient, the spirit is quiet.

This passage goes on to explain the use of jujube by Zhang Zhong-Jing in *Essentials from the Golden Cabinet*:

It can assist the ascending emergence of the Spleen's qi. [Zhang] Zhong-Jing's treatment of running piglet uses *Jujubae Fructus* (da zao) to enrich the earth in order to calm the Kidneys [since earth overcomes water]. Treating flank pain due to edema and thin mucus, [he] uses Ten Jujube [Decoction] to augment the earth and [thereby] overcome water.
