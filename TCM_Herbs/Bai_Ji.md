10 I Herbs that Regulate the Blood

abscesses, and killing parasites. For example, Omissions 
from the Grand Materia Medica records that it 
reduces food stagnation, eases fullness in the middle, drives 
qi downward, treats all disorders involving vomiting of 
blood, upset Stomach, belching, malarial disorders, pain-
ful obstruction of the throat, Intestinal wind with blood in 
the stool, accumulated food [stasis], jaundice, and treats 
abscesses and deep-rooted toxic sores, Lung abscess, breast 
abscess, and swollen hemorrhoids. 
At present it is primarily used for bleeding disorders associ-
ated with some of the ailments listed in this passage, such 
as bleeding dysenteric disorders, but also for malarial dis-
orders, swollen sores, hemorrhoids, and vaginal pruritus 
due to trichomonas infection. For the latter condition the 
young, fresh stems and leaves are often used as part of an 
external wash or douche. 
People south of the Yangtze river in China use this 
herb as a qi tonic in cases of exhaustion-hence the name 
loss-of-strength herb (n}th Jf- tilo ll dw). For this purpose, 
30g of the herb are combined with ten red dates in a strong 
decoction and sipped as a tea throughout the day. This has 
also been effectively used for bleeding ulcers in the stom-
ach or duodenum. It can also be included in the formula 
Restore the Spleen Decoction (gili p£ tang) when bleeding is 
due to Spleen deficiency which renders it unable to contain 
the blood. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
» WrTH AsrNr CoRn CoLLA (e jiao) 
Both herbs stop bleeding, but Agrimoniae Herba (xian 
he cao) also regulates and tonifies the qi and blood (see 
CoMMENTARY above), while Asini Corii Colla (e jiao) nour-
ishes the blood and yin fluids. The combination therefore 
has both a strong effect in stopping bleeding, and also a cer-
tain supplementing effect. It is widely used for many types 
of bleeding disorders such as coughing of blood, Intestinal 
wind with blood in the stool, blood in the urine due to yin 
deficiency, bleeding during pregnancy, and continuous 
uterine bleeding. It is most appropriate when bleeding is 
found with indications of yin and blood deficiency.

Toxicity 
Side effects have been reported in rare cases. The symp-
toms included nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and cold sweat. 
These symptoms resolved spontaneously after the herb 
was discontinued. Other side effects included an oppres-
sive feeling in the chest, dyspnea, palpitations, cold sweat, 
and agitation. Allergic reactions such as as pruritus and 
urticaria, as well as one case of allergic asthma, have also 
been reported.

DosAGE 
3-lSg; under unusual circumstances, up to 30g can 
be used. If taken orally as a powder, the dosage is 1.5-3g. 
C AUTIONS & C oNTRAINDICATIONS 
As an astringent, sticky 
substance, it should be used with caution whenever there 
is coughing of blood due to externally-contracted disease, 
early stage Lung abscess, or the involvment of excessive 
heat or fire toxin. 
Actions & Indications 
• Restrains leakage of blood and stops bleeding: mainly for 
bleeding from the Lungs and Stomach, which includes 
vomiting blood, coughing of blood, and nosebleed. Also 
for bleeding associated with traumatic injury, usually ap-
plied locally. 
-
With Stemonae Radix (bai bu) for coughing of blood 
due to Lung yin deficiency. 
-
With Eriobotryae Folium (pi pa ye) for coughing of 
blood-streaked sputum. 
-With Fritillariae cirrhosae Bulbus (chuan bei mu) for 
the spitting and coughing of blood associated with Lung 
abscess and Lung consumption. 
-With Sepiae Endoconcha (hai piao xiao) as a powder to 
treat vomiting of blood from bleeding peptic ulcers while 
also promoting their healing. If there are also signs of 
damp-heat, add Coicis Semen (yi yi ren). 
• Reduces swelling and generates flesh: applied topically for 
sores, ulcers, and chapped skin. It can be used whether or 
not the sore has ulcerated, as it reduces the swelling of sores 
and helps accelerate the healing of ulcers. Especially useful 
for chronic, nonhealing ulcers. 
-
With Gypsum fibrosum preparatum (duim shi gao) as a 
topical powder for wounds and cracked, bleeding skin of 
the hands and feet. 
-
With Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) as a topical paste 
for erysipelas. 
-
With Lonicerae Flos (jin yin hua), Gleditsiae Spina (ziw 
jiao ci), and Olibanum (ru xiang) as a topical preparation 
for sores on the upper back or in the mouth. 
-
With Coptidis Rhizoma (huang ficin), Fritillariae thun-
bergii Bulbus (zhe bei mu), and Galla chinensis (wu bei zi) 
as a topical powder for chronic, pustulating scrofula. 
Commentary 
Bitter, sweet, and cool, restraining and astringent, with a 
very sticky texture, Bletillae Rhizoma (bdi jf) enters the 
Lung, Stomach, and Liver channels. Internally its function 
is to constrict and stop bleeding, but applied externally it 
can also drain heat, reduce swelling, and generate flesh. 
Its main use is in the treatment of bleeding from the 
Lungs or Stomach, but it can also be used in dysfunc-
tional uterine bleeding, for wounds from trauma, and sores 
whether or not they have formed or perforated. For the 
latter two purposes it can be used both internally and exter-
nally. A common treatment for cracked and chapped skin 
of the hands is a lotion of Bletillae Rhizoma (bdi jf) powder 
mixed with sesame oil. 
Caution should be used in externally-contracted dis-
eases, due to its sticky nature, which can hold a pathogen 
within the body instead of allowing it to disperse outward. 
For the same reason, some feel that it should not be used 
in the early stages of sores and abscesses, and because it 
tends to promote the regrowth of flesh, which may cause 
the abscess to heal over before perforation allows its toxic 
pus to be expelled. Yet while this proscription would apply 
to most herbs of this nature, Bletillae Rhizoma (bai jf) may 
nonethless be used in this situation, and also for early-stage 
boils and furuncles. Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica 
explains why this is so: 
Within its astringency is dispersal, within its tonifying 
action is the ability to bust [accumulation and stagnation]. 
Thus, a special characteristic of this herb is its quality of 
dispersing while binding, and tonifying while breaking up. 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica concurs: 
Bletillae Rhizoma (bdi ji) is bitter and cold, internally clears 
pathogenic heat from the Lungs and Stomach, externally 
cools blood and stops pain. Furthermore, it is sticky and 
greasy in texture, quite oleaginous, and thus can be applied 
to incompletely formed sores to eliminate heat and reduce 
swelling, or to [sores that have] already perforated to expel 
putrefaction and generate flesh; it also treats wounds from 
metal and burns. 


10 I Herbs that Regulate the Blood 
587 
The author of this text, Zhang Shan-Lei, continues: 
Bletillae Rhizoma (bdi jf) treats Lung abscess, but everyone 
is concerned that it is greasy and sticky, and do not dare 
use it. However, bitterness and cold inherently clear the 
Lungs and Stomach, and [this herb] can also tonify what 
has been injured. As long as there is no extreme blazing 
fire at the time of use, and the putrid filthy phlegm has 
already gradually reduced, then it can be used to assist in 
tonification and clearing, and will not cause more phlegm 
or further problems. In this it is similar to Asparagi Radix 
(tiiin men dong), Ophiopogonis Radix (mcli men dong), and 
Polygonati odorati Rhizoma (yu zhu). 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
~ WITH ERIOBOTRYAE FOLIUM (pipaye) 
Eriobotryae Folium (pi pa ye) clears and directs Lung qi 
downward to transform phlegm and stop coughs, Bletillae 
Rhizoma (bdi ji) tonifies the Lungs, breaks up stasis, and 
stops bleeding. Combined, the two herbs stop coughs, 
transform phlegm, and stop bleeding, and are used in the 
treatment of heat from deficiency in the Lungs leading to 
stasis and coughing of blood. 
~ WITH GYPSUM FIBROSUM PREPARATUM (dw?ln shi giio) 
Gypsum fibrosum preparatum (duim shi giio) cools heat, 
closes sores, and generates flesh. When combined with Ble-
tillae Rhizoma (bdi ji), all of these qualities are enhanced, 
and it will stop bleeding. This combination is often used 
for wounds from metal that bleed incessantly, cracked skin 
of the hands and feet with occasional bleeding, or swollen 
toxic sores that have perforated but refuse to close. The 
combination can also be used for bleeding anal fissures, 
and for scalds and burns. The two herbs should be finely 
powdered and applied topically. 
~ WITH NoTOGINSENG RADIX (san q!); see page 561 
Comparisons 
~ Vs. PLATYCLADI CACUMEN (ce bai ye) 
Both herbs restrain and stop bleeding. While the restrain-
ing property of Platycladi Cacumen ( ce bai ye) is weaker 
than that ofBletillae Rhizoma (bdi ji), it has a stronger abil-
ity to expel phlegm and stop coughs.

CALLICARPAE FORMOSANAE FOLIUM (zi zhu);

Traditional Contraindications 
"When sores have already perforated, do not consume with 
bitter, cold herbs." (Commentary on the Divine Husband-
man's Classic of Materia Medica) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
This plant is a widespread and easily-grown ornamental 
orchid. It has been grown in European and American gar-
dens for over one-hundred years. When sliced, the herb is 
known as bletilla slices (a.&. J:l bdi ji piim). 
~ BLETILLA POWDER (a lil;fJ} bdi ji fin or 
a&$. bdijimo) 
The bulbs are cleaned of extraneous material, soaked thor-
oughly, then ground into powder and dried in the shade. 
This method of preparation is also known as bletilla flour 
(a&~ bdijfmian). It has the same properties as bletilla 
itself, but is more easily administered as a powder taken 
with the decoction. In some ways this method is even 
preferred, as Bletillae Rhizoma (bdi ji) when decocted with 
other herbs limits their absorption due to the increased 
vicosity of the liquid. According to Illumination of Materia 
Medica, the powder can also be used as a stand-alone 
herbal treatment for coughing up blood due to Lung heat. 
It is generally thought that taking the powder orally is 
more effective for stopping bleeding than when the herb is 
cooked in a decoction. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists oflarge, full, white, translucent, hard 
and solid rhizomes.
