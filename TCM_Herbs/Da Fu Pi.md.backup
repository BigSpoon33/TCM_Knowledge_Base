## 📖 Overview

Arecae Pericarpium (da fu pi), acrid and warm, enters the Large Intestine, Small Intestine, Spleen, and Stomach channels. Unblocking because of its warm nature, and dispersing because of its acrid flavor, it transforms dampness which has clumped and obstructed the flow of qi, thus restoring normal qi and fluid circulation. It eases the middle, drives qi downward, promotes fluid metabolism and flow, and reduces edema. When the fluids flow in a regular fashion, urination is natural and easy. By this means it treats abdominal distention and fullness, incomplete bowel movements, urinary difficulty, edema and leg qi due to pathogenic dampness obstructing the qi dynamic.

This herb is particularly noted for its ability to treat pathogenic influences with or without form: it can disperse formless qi stagnation, but also drain dampness and edema, which do have form. *Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi* notes that it "drives all qi downward, stops sudden turmoil disorder, unblocks the Large and Small Intestines, strengthens the Spleen, unbinds the Stomach, and regulates the middle." *The Grand Materia Medica* lists the following actions:

directs rebellious qi downward, reduces water qi, floating edema in the muscles and skin, accumulated rebellious leg qi, focal distention and fullness, fetal qi [disturbance], morning sickness, and stifling sensations in the chest [during pregnancy].

  - With Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu) for loss of appetite, epigastric and abdominal distention and fullness with edema from accumulation of dampness and water secondary to Spleen qi deficiency.
- Promotes urination and reduces edema: for abdominal distention accompanied by edema, especially superficial edema, or the symptoms of food stagnation. Also used for damp leg qi.
