3 I Downward-Draining Herbs 
241 
"Overcoming fire with water" is a traditional adage that 
quite closely matches the modern biomedical understand-
ing of this medicinal's effects on the body. 
Cheng Wu-Ji describes its use in particular formulas: 
Hardened qi requires the salty flavor to soften it; over-
abundant heat requires coldness to reduce it. Thus, 
Zhang Zhong-Jing's formulas Major Sinking Into the 
Chest Decoction (dii xiiin xiong tang), Major Order the Qi 
Decoction ( dii cheng ql tang), and Regulate the Stomach 
and Order the Qi Decoction (ticio wei cheng ql tang) all 
use it to soften hardness and expel heat from excess. If the 
clumping is not hardened, Natrii Sulfas (mcing xiao) cannot 
be used. 
Comparisons 
};> Vs. RHEr RAorx ET RHrzoMA (da huang) 
Natrii Sulfas (mangxiiio) is salty and cold, while Rhei Radix 
et Rhizoma (da huang) is bitter and cold, yet both drain 
accumulated heat in the treatment of clumped heat in the 
Large Intestine, which causes constipation. The two herbs 
are commonly used together for this purpose. However, 
Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da huang) not only drains qi level 
heat from excess in yang brightness disorders, but also 
enters the blood level to cool the blood, resolve toxicity, 
and break up static accumulations. It is therefore used for 
nosebleeds and spitting up of blood due to blood heat; red, 
swollen, and painful eyes; and gynecological abdominal 
masses. The primary function ofNatrii Sulfas (mang xiiio) 
is to clear the Large Intestine and soften areas of hardness 
in the treatment of constipation. 
Traditional Contraindications 
If there is no pathogenic clumping in the lower burner, 
with no hard firmness to palpate, do not use it, for fear that 
it will exhaust the true yin of the lower burner. If an illness 
does not originate from pathogenic heat deeply bound, 
with closed clumping that is difficult to pass, definitely do 
not lightly use it. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
};> NITRE ( .C tj!j mang xiiio) 
Impure mirabilite is boiled in water until dissolved. It is 
then filtered, and the clear liquid left to cool. The best 
temperature for the crystallization process is 10°C, so the 
procedure is best performed during autumn and winter. 
Otherwise, at temperatures over 34°C, the crystallization 
process suffers. The crystals are then left in a windless place 
to thoroughly dry. 
Traditionally, the initial boiling process is performed 
with water in which fresh sliced turnips have been previ-
ously decocted. This mode of preparation draws on the 
ability of turnips to reduce accumulated blockage, trans-
form phlegm-heat, and ease the middle; when boiled with 
mirabilite, it forms purer crystals, and strengthens its soft-
ening, guiding, and downward-draining actions. When the 
crystal is long, like a horse's tooth, it is called horse-teeth 
nitre ( .~ ;f tj!j maya xiiio), and when a particularly clean 
product is desired, the term clean nitre ( ~ .C tj!j jlng mang 
xiiio) is specified. 
};> REFINED MIRABILITE (~ Bfl tf xuan mingfin)-
PHARMACEUTICAL NAME: NATRII SULFAS SICCATUS 
This is prepared by allowing the water content of Natrii 
Sulfas (mang xiiio) to evaporate. The direct translation of 
its name is "dark brightness powder." In the eighteenth 
century, however, due to the taboo against using any 
character that was found in the name of the Qing dynasty 
Kangxi Emperor (whose given name was ~ :1#: Xuan-Ye), 
the name of this medicinal was changed to "original bright-
ness powder" (:it Bfl ;f.,} yuan ming fin). This has remained 
to this day as an alternate name. This mode of preparation 
moderates its laxative effect, but renders it more effective in 
topical preparations for ulcers of the oral cavity, sores, and 
ophthalmological applications. It is contraindicated during 
pregnancy. The normal dosage is 3-9g. 
};> NITRE EFFLORESCENCE (Jil1[.tj!j feng hua xiiio) 
This is the powder that remains when 'clean nitre' has been 
exposed to the wind, leading to transpiro-evaporation of its 
water content. It has the same actions as refined mirabilite. 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica notes: 
In winter, placed in a coarse bag and hung from the eaves, 
its substance gradually turns white; this is nitre efflores-
cence, which obtains lightness without directing downward, 
and is an excellent remedy for heavy drinkers in whom old, 
stubborn phlegm readily forms. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality is colorless, transparent, and crystalline.

KEY CHARACTERISTICS 
drains downward and guides out 
stagnant heat in the Intestines 
DosAGE 
1.5-3g for a mild laxative effect; 4.5-9g for a strong 
purge. Usually taken as a tea. If decocted, it should be 
added near the end. 
CAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS 
Contraindicated in 
women who are pregnant, breast feeding, or have a history 
of heavy bleeding. At the higher dosage, contraindicated 
for those who are weak. See ToxiCITY below. 
Actions & Indications 
• Drains downward and guides out stagnation: for consti-
pation due to heat accumulation in the Intestines. Can 
be used for both acute and chronic problems. Often used 
alone. 
- With Citri reticulatae Pericarpium (chen pi) to both 
improve the principal herb's action in restoring nor-
mal bowel movements and to ameliorate its cold, colicky 
aspects. 
- With Aurantii Fructus immaturus (zhi shi) and Mag-
noliae officinalis Cortex (hou po) to strengthen the prin-
cipal herb's actions of draining downward and guiding out 
stagnation. 
- With Pogostemonis/ A gas taches Herba (huo xiang) and 
Aucklandiae Radix (mit xiang) for constipation due to heat 
accumulation in the Large Intestine channel. 
Commentary 
Bitter and cold, with a slippery yet sticky nature, Sennae 
Folium (fan xie ye) enters the Large Intestine to drain 
accumulated heat downward and moisten dryness in the 
Intestine; it is thus used for constipation due to clumped 
heat. Its downward-draining action is stronger than that of 
Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da huang): 2-3g infused will lead 
to mild colic and passage of stool within five to six hours. 
A small dose such as this can be used for habitual constipa-
tion, or constipation in a weak or elderly patient, in order 
to promote initial movement in the bowels. This is followed 
by other measures to maintain regularity. 
One of the adverse aspects of this herb is that, in larger 
amounts (6-12g), it also causes uncomfortable colicky 
pain, as well as nausea, vomiting, inflammation of the 
intestinal mucous membrane, and perfusion of the pelvic 
cavity with blood, which can exacerbate uterine bleeding. 
Thus, it should not be used for women who are pregnant, 
breastfeeding, or who have a history of heavy bleeding. Nor 
should it be prescribed in higher doses for weak patients. 
This adverse aspect is managed by combining Sennae 
Folium (fan xie ye) with herbs that promote qi movement 
in the Large Intestine, such as Citri reticulatae Pericarpium 
(chen pi), Foeniculi Fructus (xiao hui xiang), or Magnoliae 
officinalis Cortex (hOu po), or by using it in much smaller 
amounts in combination with Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da 
huang). Alternatively, a tea can be made with cold water, 
letting it stand for a while before drinking. This moderates 
the effects of the irritating resins contained in the leaves 
of the herb. Adding Foeniculi Fructus (xiao hui xiang), 
Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bO he), or Citri reticulatae 
Pericarpium (chen pi) assists its effects. 
Sennae Folium (fan xle ye) is excreted in the urine, and 
also in breast milk. In very small doses it strengthens the 
digestion, and is thus good for those who are constipated 
from food stagnation and have lost their appetite. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
};> WITH CITRI RETICULATAE PERICARPIUM (chen pi) 
Sennae Folium (fan xie ye) is sweet, bitter, and cold, 
directly entering the Large Intestine to drain accumulated 
pathogenic heat and unblock the bowels. It is often used 
for constipation due to obstructing heat; however, it can 
also cause nausea and colicky abdominal pain. Citri reticu-
latae Pericarpium (chen pi) is acrid, and thus it disperses; 
bitter, and thus it drains; warm, and thus it unblocks and 
mobilizes. These qualities give it a strong qi-regulating and
