## 📖 Overview

*Paeoniae* Radix alba (bai shao) is bitter, sour, and cool; it enters the Liver channel where its sourness inhibits the yin. The Liver favors dispersal, and this quality is, in effect, tonified by an acrid flavor which encourages dispersal; conversely; a sour-inhibiting action has the effect of draining the Liver. At the same time, *Paeoniae* Radix alba (bai shao) also cools and nourishes the blood; thus, it could be classified with equal validity as an herb that extinguishes wind, owing to its ability to nourish Liver blood and soften the Liver, thereby preventing the floating ascent of Liver yang. *Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances* observes:

The slight bitterness of *Paeoniae* Radix alba (bai shao) tonifies yin, while its slight sourness restrains and inhibits. Because sourness travels to the Liver, short-term use will tonify the Liver; [but] because the Liver's nature favors dispersal and is averse to inhibition, this sourness is also used to curb the Liver. This is why it is said that *Paeoniae* Radix alba (bai shao) both tonifies and drains.

The Liver governs the sinews, which cramp and spasm if unsupported by the Liver blood. This herb tonifies the Liver blood and thereby relieves pain due to acutely cramped sinews, or other pain associated with Liver blood deficiency, such as in the flanks and abdomen. The Liver stores the blood, and reduced blood storage can affect other important blood organs, such as the Heart, and the 'sea of blood', which refers to the Womb and its associated vessels. If the Heart lacks the support of Liver blood palpitations and insomnia may result; if the sea of blood lacks the support of Liver blood, menstruation can become irregular and cause infertility or dysmenorrhea. All of these disorders are appropriate for treatment with *Paeoniae* Radix alba (bai shao). Thus, one could look at the softening aspect of this herb as having an "unwinding" function, due to its dual tonification and drainage, that allows the Liver to soften up enough to accept the blood and store it, much like a sponge soaks up water.

This herb also enters the Spleen channel and supports the Spleen when it is accosted by rebellious Liver qi. *Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica* notes that it "tonifies the blood and augments the true yin of the Liver and Spleen. In order to inhibit and contain the chaotic dispersal of the Spleen qi, or the unrestrained transverse rebellion of the Liver qi, *Paeoniae* Radix alba (bai shao) [is the herb to use]." It goes on to say that this herb is "bitter and slightly sour, [so that it] augments the yin of the great yin Spleen, while holding in lax and dispersed great qi (大氣 da qi), and also augmenting the Liver yin and quieting its transverse rebellion."

Because of its ability to cool, nourish, and restrain the yin, this herb is often used as an assistant in the treatment of sweating from various causes, such as spontaneous sweating from disharmony at the nutritive and protective levels and nightsweats due to yin deficiency. *Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica* notes that, "together with *Cinnamomi* Ramulus (gui zhi), it inhibits sweating due to wind [pathogen]; together with *Astragali* Radix (huang qi) and *Ginseng* Radix (ren shen), it restrains sweating from deficiency."

### Mechanisms of Selected Combinations

**WITH *GLYCYRRHIZAE* RADIX (gan cao)**

The Liver is a hard, 'edgy' organ and its qi has a tendency to rebel transversely. *Paeoniae* Radix alba (bai shao) preserves the yin, softens the Liver, and alleviates pain. It is effective in moderating the wayward inclinations of the Liver qi and preserving the Liver yin; this is what is meant by softening of the Liver. *Glycyrrhizae* Radix (gan cao) tonifies and augments the qi of the middle burner, especially that of the Spleen. Together these herbs regulate the relationship between the Liver and Spleen and nourish the sinews.

**WITH *SCUTELLARIAE* RADIX (huang qin)**

This combination was first cited in a formula from *Discussion of Cold Damage*, Scutellaria Decoction (Huang Qin Tang), to treat dysenteric disorders with abdominal pain due to heat entering the interior. *Scutellariae* Radix (huang qin) is bitter and cold, and drains heat in the Large Intestine, while *Paeoniae* Radix alba (bai shao) is bitter, sour, and cool, moderates urgency, stops pain, and augments the yin blood. Together, the bitterness drains while the sourness restrains, thus eliminating pathogenic heat while it restrains and moderates excessively urgent Intestinal movement. Generations of physicians have used this combination as the foundation upon which to design prescriptions for painful dysenteric disorders due to heat. It is also, however, a common gynecological combination, used for cooling heat while nourishing the blood, particularly during pregnancy, as *Scutellariae* Radix (huang qin) is noted for quieting the fetus when it is disturbed by pathogenic heat. *Paeoniae* Radix alba (bai shao) cools and nourishes the Liver blood and yin, while *Scutellariae* Radix (huang qin) cools heat in the blood aspect. Thus this combination is used together with other herbs for disorders such as Liver heat accosting the Spleen and Stomach in early pregnancy, leading to severe nausea and vomiting.
