## 📖 Overview

Pure yang, acrid, warm, and aromatic, Caryophylli Flos (ding xiang) enters the Spleen and Stomach channels to warm the middle burner and direct Stomach qi downward, and is thus often used in the treatment of vomiting and hiccough due to Stomach cold. It also enters the Kidney channel and warms the lower burner in the treatment of impotence and cold sensations in the vagina.

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica describes its effects: "warms the middle and eases the qi. Treats upper burner rebellion [causing] hiccough, eliminates Stomach cold diarrhea, [and any of] the five constraints affecting the seven emotions." In Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing-Cheng concurs, but goes further:

Below, it reaches the Kidneys and Liver, guides the qi, expels cold. Whenever the lower burner has disorders such as running piglet, painful abdominal masses due to cold, mobile abdominal masses, and bulging disorders, as long as the Kidney yang is insufficient and there is coldness, this can be used for all.
