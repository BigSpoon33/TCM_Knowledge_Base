Commentary 
Houttuyniae Herba (yu xlng cao) is acrid and cold, and 
enters the Lung and Large Intestine channels with the abil-
ity to disperse heat, resolve toxicity, and reduce swelling. It 
is often used in the treatment of heat toxin sores and swell-
ing, and is particularly appropriate for the cough, wheez-
ing, and spitting up of blood and pus that is associated with 
Lung abscess due to phlegm-heat accumulating and caus-
ing stagnation. The Grand Materia Medica confirms that 
it "disperses heat toxin and swollen sores." Recent clinical 
experience suggests that Houttuyniae Herba (yu xfng cao) 
can facilitate urination, and is therefore useful in the treat-
ment of such biomedically-defined disorders as urinary 
tract infection and painful urinary dribbling. 
Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of 
Materia Medica says that Houttuyniae Herba (yu xfng cao) 
is "an important herb in the treatment of phlegm-heat 
clogging the Lungs, manifesting as Lung abscess with the 
expectoration of pus and blood." 
The Record of Picking Herbs in Lingnan says that "The 
leaves, if applied to noxious toxins or large sores, can 
resolve the toxicity. Decocted and imbibed, it can eliminate 
damp-heat, and treat dysenteric disorders." 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
::o-- WITH PLATYcoor RAorx (jie geng) 
Both herbs enter the Lung channel and are important for 
treating Lung abscess. Lung abscess begins when the Lung 
qi fails to disseminate. This causes heat to build up and 
phlegm to accumulate. The two pathogens interact, com-
bine, and exacerbate each other, intensifying until toxic 
accumulation obstructs tissue nourishment and results in 
local necrosis and pus formation. The symptoms include 
coughing of malodorous blood and pus. 
Houttuyniae Herba (yu xfng cao) cools heat and resol-
ves toxicity and is thus ideal for reducing abscesses by vir-
tue of its strong ability to eliminate heat toxin and reduce 
swelling. On the other hand, Platycodi Radix (jie geng) 
excels at disseminating the Lung qi; by unblocking the flow 
of qi, the pus and phlegm can be expelled.
