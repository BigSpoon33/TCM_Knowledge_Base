## 📖 Overview

Acrid, bitter, and cold, Prunellae Spica (xià kū cǎo) cools and disperses. It is used for Liver fire, especially that due to constraint, and also disperses clumped stagnation, such as phlegm thickened by heat. Zhu Dan-Xi noted that Prunellae Spica (xià kū cǎo) also nourishes the yin and blood of the Liver, but many later commentators disagreed with this assertion. Since it grows in spring and early summer, but withers as soon as the first hint of yin qi appears after mid-summer, many writers describe Prunellae Spica (xià kū cǎo) as being "full of pure yang qi."

Nodules of phlegm, such as scrofula, are often a result of Liver qi constraint, which allows fluids to accumulate, thicken, and become phlegm. Over time this phlegm and constraint engenders heat, which further thickens the phlegm and forms palpable clumps and nodules. In such cases, Prunellae Spica (xià kū cǎo) is often used as it can both cool Liver fire and disperse the clumps.

This herb was noted for its efficacy in the treatment of clumping and nodules as early as the Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica. In Indispensable Tools for Pattern Treatment, Wang Ken-Tang recommends a formula made of 180g of just this herb decocted and taken before meals to treat scrofula at any stage of development: "the more the better." Modern textbooks confirm that long-term consumption of Prunellae Spica (xià kū cǎo) as a syrup has a reliable therapeutic effect for scrofula.

Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica notes that it "treats pain in the eyes which occurs at night, because it disperses fire from constraint in the terminal yin channel." Materia medica textual entries for this herb over the centuries repeatedly mention its efficacy for the type of eye pain that worsens or only occurs at night. Zhang Shan-Lei is quite explicit in his explanation:

The eyeball is linked to terminal yin [Liver]; if it worsens at night or on contact with cold herbs, this is constraint of yin fire in the terminal yin, unable to disperse. Naturally, one should not attempt to directly break it up with cold [because cold contracts]-this will just make it worse!

Prunellae Spica (xià kū cǎo) can dredge and unblock Liver and Gallbladder qi: "If wood is constrained, allow it to reach out" [says the adage]. Furthermore, because it contains pure yang qi, it can disperse clumped stagnant heat in the midst of yin.
