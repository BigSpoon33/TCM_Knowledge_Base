## 📖 Overview

Salty, cold, and heavy in weight, *Magnetitum* (ci shi) enters the Liver and Kidney channels to protect the true yin, anchor the yang which is floating upward, and quiet the Heart spirit. The Kidneys govern the bones and store the essence, and the orifice of the Kidneys is the ears; thus, when the Kidneys are deficient and the essence is exhausted, there will be dizziness, tinnitus, and deafness, or wheezing, as the Kidneys fail to grasp the qi. The Liver governs the sinews and stores the blood, and the orifice of the Liver is the eyes; thus, when the Liver is deficient and lacks blood, the sinews will become weak and the vision will be impaired. Yin deficiency allows the yang to ascend, leading to derangement of the Heart spirit and thus palpitations, forgetfulness, insomnia, and restless activity.

In all of these situations, *Magnetitum* (ci shi) can serve as the chief medicinal, because its salty coldness travels into the lower body to nourish the Kidneys, augment the essence and blood, and suppress and contain the floating yang.

The *Grand Materia Medica* says that it "treats all disorders of the Kidneys, while unblocking the ears and brightening the eyes." *Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica* adds that it "enters the Kidneys to sedate the yin, preventing the dragon fire (i.e., the ministerial fire of the Kidneys) from rising upward out of the yin." It then quotes the sixth-century writer Xu Zhi-Cai: "[Xu said that] 'heaviness can eliminate trepidation;' *Magnetitum* (ci shi) is a type of powdered iron [and is heavy], so when trepidation causes the qi to float, it should be suppressed with a large dose [of it]." It goes on to say that, logically, it should not be used together with iron.

The *Golden Mirror of the Medical Tradition* has an interesting note about *Magnetitum* (ci shi) saying that it enters the Kidneys "drawing in Lung metal qi to generate essence." *Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica* concurs, but without explicity making the connection between the Lung qi entering Kidneys and the generation of essence: "Acrid, salty, color black pertaining to water. Can guide Lung metal qi to enter the Kidneys. Tonifies the Kidneys and augments the essence." *Materia Medica of Medicinal Properties* takes this in a slightly different direction, stating that it "tonifies Kidney deficiency in males." This refers to its use in *Important Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces* for impotence.
