2 I Herbs that Clear Heat 
105 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "cold water stone" 
There are two minerals used as calcitum (~J)<..;G han shu[ 
shi), which was called congealing water stone (l~tJj(.;G ning 
shu[ shi) in the Grand Materia Medica. One is Gypsum 
rubrum, or red gypsum (#-.:r.;G i" hong shi gao), whose 
constituents are basically those of gypsum (CaS04·2Hp). 
Because this is the form mainly used in northern China, it 
is also known as northern calcitum ( :JI:. ~Jj(.;G bei han shu[ 
shf). The other mineral is calcite (CaC03), known as 1i Wf. 
;G fang jie shi. This is primarily used in the southern part 
of China, and is thus also known as southern han shu! shi 
( ~ 
~J)<..;G min han shui shi). This is the more standard 
product and the one that is generally available outside of 
China. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality is yellowish white or white with a smooth 
surface; if dipped in hydrochloric acid, bubbles of carbon 
dioxide will vigorously develop. No foreign mineral matter 
should be present. 
Major known chemical constituents 
Calcite (CaC03), traces of Mg, Si, Fe, AI, Ba, Sr 
Gypsum rubrum: (CaS04·2H20), traces of Si, Mg, AI, Fe, Sr, Ti, Ba 
Alternate species and local variants 
Gypsum rubrum, literally red gypsum (fo.:r.Xi -t hong shi gao), 
should be of a reddish white color, with a rough surface. If dipped 
in hydrochloric acid, no gas bubbles should appear. No foreign 
mineral matter should be present.

"nourishes dried blood."
