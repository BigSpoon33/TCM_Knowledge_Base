15 I Aromatic Substances that Open the Orifices 
Musk is a very valuable substance. The per-ounce price 
in Europe during the past decade reached three to five 
times that of gold. It is estimated that three to five musk 
deer-including juveniles and females-are killed to cap-
ture a single male with approximately 25 grams of raw 
musk. We therefore recommend that either musk from 
farmed animals, or the synthetic product, be used. Musk 
is currrently listed in CITES II. In fact, at the present time, 
basically all commercially available products use synthetic 
Moschus ( 1;-JfX.llf W he cheng she xiang), which is a reddish 
brown or dark brown, oily, granular powder. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality furry sac musk consists of full, soft, oily, 
granular, and intensely aromatic glands with thin skin. 
Good quality musk kernels consist of purplish black or 
dark brown granular or powdery, oily, and intensely aro-
matic masses. 
Major known chemical constituents 
Macrocyclic compounds: muscone, normuscone, muscol, 3-methyl-
cyclotridecan-1-one, cyclotetradecan-1-one, 5-cis-cyclotetradecen-
1-one, 5-cis-cyclopentadecen-1-one, 5-cis-(14-methyl)-cyclopenta-
decen-1-one, 2,6-decamethylene dihydropyran, muscopyran, 2,6-
nonamethylene pyridin, 2,6-decamethylene pyridine, muscopy-
ridine, hydroxymuscopyridine A, B 
Steroids: 5a-androstan-3,17-dione, 58-androstan-3,17-dione, 
3a-hydroxy-58-androstan-17-one, 3a-hydroxy-5a-androstan-17-one, 
38-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17 ·one, 38-hydroxy-5a-androstan-17 -one, 
androst-4-en-3,17 -diene, andros-4,6-diene-3,17-dione, 5a-andro-
stane-38,17a-diol, 58-androstane-3a,178-diol, 58-androstane-
3a,17a-diol, 3a-hydroxyandrostane-4-en-178-one, estradiol, tes-
tosterone, cholest-4-ene-3-one, cholesterol 
Other constituents: allantoin, musclide A, fixed oil, long-chained 
aliphatic alcohols (C20-C34), amino acids, proteins 
Adulterants 
Because of the high value of the natural substance, many counter-
feit products made of animal skins, dried muscle tissue, sawdust, 
tea leaves, sargassum or other plant tissues, grease, milk powder, 
etc., can be found on the market. For precise identification, chemi-
cal, microscopic, and chromatographic methods are absolutely 
necessary.

Additional product information 
Based on the method of processing, two different natural products 
can be distinguished: the whole glands, called furry sac musk (.of:. 
~4\ -t- mao ke she xiang), and the inner parts of the gland, called 
musk kernels (4\ -t-1=- she xiang ren). 
Based on their place of origin, three different products can be dis-
tinguished: Sichuan musk (Jil4\ .W chuan she xiang), from Sichuan, 
Yunnan, and W Guizhou provinces; western musk (®4\-\f xishe 
xiang), from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces; and opening 
musk (O 4\ :t ki5u she xiang), from Inner Mongolia and NE China. 
The commonly-used Moschus spp. are listed under Appendix II 
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species 
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This appendix lists species that 
are not necessarily now threatened with extinction, but that may 
become so unless trade is closely controlled. A permit is required 
both for export from China and import to other countries, and may 
therefore be difficult to obtain. Some populations of these deer 
are threatened with extinction and are listed under Appendix I.

Contraindicated in cases 
of high fever and coma, and spontaneous sweating and

Actions & Indications 
• Opens the orifices and penetrates through turbidity to 
awaken the spirit: for closed disorder, phlegm collapse, 
and epidemic toxic diseases. Especially indicated for cold 
disorders. 


15 I Aromatic Substances that Open the Orifices 
951 
- With Moschus (she xiiing), Caryophylli Flos (ding xiiing), 
and Benzoinum ( iin xf xiiing) for sudden loss of conscious-
ness and coma, chest pain, childhood convulsions, or sei-
zures, especially in cases with phlegm and qi obstruction, as 
in Liquid Styrax Pill (sii he xiiing wan). 
• Opens up areas of constraint and clears away filth: for sti-
fling sensations, cold, fullness, and pain in the chest and 
abdomen. Recently used for such problems as coronary 
artery disease and biliary colic. Applied topically for chil-
blain. 
-
With Borneolum (bing pian), Olibanum (ru xicmg), and 
Santali albi Lignum (tan xiiing) for angina pectoris. 
Commentary 
Sweet, acrid, and warm in nature, with an intense aroma, 
Styrax (sii he xiiing) excels at opening the orifices and clear-
ing away filth, and is used to open closed patterns occurring 
with sudden loss of consciousness as a result of wind-stroke 
or phlegm collapse. Closed disorders can be hot or cold, 
and each type requires an appropriate substance to open 
them up: hot opening substances for patterns of cold 
closure, and cold opening substances for patterns of hot 
closure. Because Styrax (sii he xiiing) is warm, mobile, and 
piercing, it is best suited for wind-stroke or phlegm col-
lapse in patterns of cold-closure and should not be used 
for patterns of hot-closure or abandoned disorders from 
deficiency. 
Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica 
explains that it 
is created by the accumulation of the qi of various [types 
of] fragrances; it ventilates every yin organ and orifice, and 
clears away every type of abnormal qi. Whenever phlegm 
accumulates [leading to] qi collapse, this must first be used 
to open and guide-to treat phlegm, first regulate the qi as 
the basis [for further treatment]. For the miasmic damp qi 
of mountain mists which invades the channels and collater-
als causing intermittent cramps and spasms, Styrax (sii he 
xiiing) is imperative for treatment. 
Its fragrance is so penetrating that one traditional test for 
Styrax (sil he xiiing) is to rub a small amount into the palm 
of the hand; if its fragrance penetrates through to the back 
of the hand, it is the genuine article. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
>- WITH MOSCHUS (she xiiing); see page 949 
Comparisons 
>- Vs. MoscHus (she xiiing) 
Both substances are acrid, warm, and aromatic, and both 
open the orifices and awaken the spirit. However, Styrax 
(sil he xiiing) more strongly clears away filth and expels 
phlegm, and is thus best used for turbid, filthy qi disturb-
ing the body and causing loss of consciousness, and for 
wind-stroke with overabundant phlegm causing loss of 
consciousness. 
Moschus (she xiiing), on the other hand, is stronger 
than Styrax (sil he xiiing) at opening the orifices and awak-
ening the spirit, while its mobile, piercing nature unblocks 
the channels and thrusts out through the collaterals. Hence 
it is also often used for qi and blood stagnation with swell-
ing and pain.

Traditional Contraindications 
"Contraindicated in those with yin deficiency and fire from 
excess." (Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia 
Medica) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "revive and join fragrance" 
The word styrax is derived from the Arabic word assitirax, 
meaning 'sweet-smelling exudate'. The Chinese Styrax (sil 
he xiiing), produced from the tree Liquidamber orienta/is, is 
equivalent to the international commercial product known 
as Levant Styrax, also known as liquid styrax (in Chinese 
the 'liquid' is oil: .~% )m sii he y6u), or just styrax. The lat-
ter should not be confused with the balsamic resin derived 
from Styrax benzoin, which is Benzoinum (iin xf xiiing), 
also known as benzoin. 
This substance is derived from cutting the bark of the 
tree in early summer, causing the tree to produce new wood 
with resin-secreting ducts. The resin (balsam) saturates the 
bark, which is collected in autumn, boiled, then pressed to 
collect the balsam, known at this point as crude styrax (if 
i!.~%1' pu tong sil he xiiing). When dissolved in ethanol, 
filtered, and then distilled to remove the ethanol, it is called 
refined styrax (;f.k~t~%1' jfng zhl sil he xiiing). Only the 
latter is now imported for use in China. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality is yellowish white, translucent, aromatic, and 
free of foreign matter. 
Major known chemical constituents 
Resins (±35%): storesinol, 3-epi-oleanonic acid, oleanonic acid 
Liquid constituents: cinnamic acid, phenyl-propyl cinnamate, 
cinnamyl cinnamate (styracin) 
Adulterants 
Often adulterated by the addition of terpentine oil or castor oil. For 
this reason, the content of cinnamic acid should not be less than 
28.5 percent.
