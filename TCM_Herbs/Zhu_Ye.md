Commentary 
Lophatheri Herba (dan zhu ye) is bland, sweet, and cold. Its 
ability to leach out dampness and facilitate urination is very 
strong, while at the same time it cools the Heart and thus 
eliminates irritability. It is usually prescribed for febrile 
diseases, irritability, thirst, scanty dark urine, and painful 
urinary dribbling. Because it is lightweight with a thin qi, it 
is also used to treat upper burner qi-level heat. Harm and 
Benefit in the Materia Medica notes, however, that "Its ther-
apeutic strength is rather weak. It cannot serve as the chief 
herb, but it can serve as an assistant." The Grand Materia 
Medica was the first book to identify Lophatheri Herba 
(dan zhu ye). It comments briefly that the herb "expels 
irritable heat, facilitates urination, and cools the Heart." 
Lophatheri Herba (dim zhu ye) has a greater diuretic action 
than actual bamboo leaves, which are better for heat in the 
upper burner causing cough, irritability, and thirst.
