## üìñ Overview

Sweet, mild, and warm so that it gently moves, while its mild bitterness drains downward, Notoginseng Radix (san qi) is a well-known herb for stopping bleeding without bringing about stasis, and dispelling stasis without causing more bleeding. When stasis is removed, the blood which has been forced out of its normal channels of circulation can then return and flow normally, and the pain and swelling due to stagnant blood is eliminated. In Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing-Cheng notes that "Yang brightness and terminal yin are channels with abundant blood; [Notoginseng Radix (san qi)] enters them"; thus, the Stomach, Large Intestine, and Liver channels are those for which this herb has the greatest affinity.

Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western observes:

As it excels at transforming blood stasis, so it also excels in the treatment of women's abdominal masses and blocked menstruation; it transforms static blood without injuring new blood: it is truly a marvelous herb for regulating the blood!

Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica elaborates:

People only know Notoginseng Radix (san qi) as a herb that stops bleeding and pain; little do they imagine that this pain is due to blood stasis. Once the blood has dispersed sufficiently, the bleeding stops. Notoginseng Radix (san qi) is bitter and warm, so it transforms blood stasis within the blood aspect. One can test this by placing Notoginseng Radix (san qi) in pig's blood: the blood transforms into liquid. Arnebiae Radix/Lithospermi Radix (zi cao) and Carthami Flos (hong hua) are just not in this category!

Interestingly, the procedure described here is still used as a quick test for the authenticity of this herb. The powdered herb is placed in fresh pig's blood. If it is authentic, the blood should liquefy. Another quick test is to place Notoginseng Radix (san qi) powder in a spoon and add white vinegar. True Notoginseng Radix (san qi) should turn reddish brown.
