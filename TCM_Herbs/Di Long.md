## 📖 Overview

Salty and cold, with a downward-directing nature, Pheretima (di long) directs downward, drains, and excels at moving and piercing. When it travels through the Liver channel, it not only clears heat, extinguishes wind, and settles convulsions, but also unblocks the channels and collaterals, stops pain, and unblocks clumping and blockage. When it travels through the Lung channel, it clears Lung heat and calms wheezing. Due to its salty coldness, it travels into the lower burner, entering the Kidney channel to facilitate the fluid pathways and unblock clumped urinary blockage or painful urinary dribbling.

Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica states that it is greatly cold so that it can expel heat pathogens, eliminate high fever, and thus remedy delirium due to lurking heat following cold damage. Salty [flavor] primarily travels downward, facilitating urination, and thus treating enlarged abdomen and jaundice.

Pheretima (di long) is used for a wide variety of disorders, including delirium and convulsions due to high fever; cough and wheezing with yellow phlegm due to Lung heat; pain in the limbs or hemiplegia due to damp-heat, cold dampness, or phlegm-dampness obstructing the collaterals; painful urinary dribbling or urinary blockage due to heat clumping, and jaundice with abdominal ascites. The Grand Materia Medica says that "Its nature is cold and travels downward; this coldness relieves all heat afflictions, the downward movement facilitates urination and treats afflictions of the leg, while unblocking the channels and collaterals."

Fresh Pheretima (xian di long) is ground with sugar and applied topically for burns, chronic ulcerations of the lower limb, or mumps.
