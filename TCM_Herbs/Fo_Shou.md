CAUTIONS & CONTRAINDICATIONS 
Use with caution in those 
with yin deficiency with fire. 
Actions & Indications 
• Spreads and regulates the Liver qi: for Liver qi constraint 
leading to chest or hypochondria! pain or a stifling sensa-
tion in the chest. This herb strongly promotes the move-
ment of qi, but its ability to alleviate pain is weak. 
- With Cyperi Rhizoma (xiang fu) and Curcumae Radix 
(yu jin) to strengthen its function of spreading the Liver 
qi. 
• Harmonizes the Stomach and strengthens the Spleen: for 
Spleen and Stomach qi stagnation with epigastric pain, 
fullness and distention, lack of appetite, belching and/or 
vomiting. 
-
With Aucklandiae Radix (mit xiang) and Citri reticu-
latae viride Pericarpium (qlng pf) for indigestion, fullness 
and discomfort in the chest, epigastrium, and abdomen, 
loss of appetite, and belching or vomiting. 
• Transforms phlegm and stops coughs: for subacute or 
chronic cough with copious phlegm. Especially useful for 
unrelenting cough with chest pain. Because its phlegm-
transforming function is rather weak, it is not used in treat-
ing the early stages of externally-contracted coughs. 
-
With Eriobotryae Folium (pi pa ye) and Luffae Fructus 
Retinervus (sf gua luo) for unrelenting, subacute cough 
with chest pain. 
Commentary 
Acrid, bitter, and slightly warm, Citri sarcodactylis Fructus 
(f6 shou) enters the Liver, Lung, Spleen, and Stomach chan-
nels with a clear, fragrant aroma that expands the chest, 
breaks up phlegm, harmonizes the middle burner, and 
frees constraint by spreading Liver qi. 
Li Shi-Zhen said of this herb: "Boiled in wine, then con-
sumed, it treats phlegm qi and cough; decocted in water, it 
treats qi pain in the epigastrium." Thus it is often used in 
the treatment of wheezing, cough, and stifling sensation in 
the chest, if profuse phlegm is present, because it promotes 
the flow of qi and transforms phlegm. It is also used in 
the treatment of constrained Liver and Spleen qi causing 
distending fullness of the flanks and abdomen and loss of 
appetite. This is because, as it promotes the flow of qi, it 
awakens the Spleen. 
In Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing-
Cheng noted that it "particularly regulates the qi and eases 
the diaphragm, but only qi stagnation in the Liver and 
Spleen are suitable for its use." 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Used by itself, or used excessively, it will harm the normal 
qi." (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "Buddha's hand" 
Often the fruit is cut into slices and is therefore known as 
sliced finger citron fruit (1~ -t J:l f6 sh6u pian). Traditional-
ly, the aged, dried fruit has been considered superior. It 
is referred to as aged finger citron fruit at 1~ -t chen f6 
shou). 
The fruit produced in Sichuan province is called 
Sichuan finger citron fruit (1111~ -t chuiin f6 sh6u). The 
slices are small, but thick and richly aromatic, with a rela-
tively strong ability to promote the flow of qi. That grown 
in Guangdong province is called Guangdong finger citron 
fruit ( JJ 1~ -t guang f6 shou). It consists of large, thin slices 
with a relatively bland flavor, and is less able to promote 
the flow of qi. However, it regulates the qi without harm-
ing the yin, and is thus appropriate for use in patients with 
Stomach and Spleen yin deficiency.
