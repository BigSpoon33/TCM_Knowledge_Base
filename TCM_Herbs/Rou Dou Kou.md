## 📖 Overview

Most of the herbs named dou kou are acrid, warm, aromatic, and drying, but only Myristicae Semen (rou dou kou) also possesses an astringent, binding quality. Note that this binding action is only a property of the roasted variety; unprepared nutmeg can actually cause diarrhea in addition to a variety of other serious problems. The comments here concern only the roasted form of the herb.

Affecting particularly the middle and lower burners, this herb warms the Spleen and Stomach, restores smooth circulation to the qi dynamic, and binds up the Intestines. Grand Materia Medica says that it "warms the Spleen and Stomach, and stabilizes the Large Intestine." It is most often used in patterns of cold from deficiency of the Spleen and Kidneys leading to unstable slippage in the Intestines, with such symptoms as chronic diarrhea or dysenteric disorders. It is also used for epigastric distending pain, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting due to cold from deficiency with qi stagnation in the Stomach and Intestines. Hidden Aspects of Materia Medica notes that, when used for dysenteric disorders, it should be taken with white rice congee, and when used for vomiting and diarrhea, it should be taken with fresh ginger tea.

Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica observes:

Spleen earth favors fragrant aromas, so Myristicae Semen (rou dou kou) is extremely suitable for the Spleen and Stomach. As to its ability to drive qi downward, the reason for this is the strengthened transportation derived from torrifying the Spleen and Stomach; it is not like the drastic action of Magnoliae officinalis Cortex (hou po) and Aurantii Fructus immaturus (zhi shi).

However, in Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, Zhang Jie-Bin has a different explanation:

As to its stabilization of the Large Intestine, this means that the primal qi does not run out of the Intestines, and the Spleen qi is naturally strengthened. Thus, when it is said that it regulates cold from deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach, it is not actually torrifying deficiency.
