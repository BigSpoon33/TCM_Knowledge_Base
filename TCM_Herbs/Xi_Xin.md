l-3g. The dosage must be kept low in powders, 
pills, or in any formulations in which the herb is not 
cooked. 
CAUTIONS & CoNTRAINDICATIONS 
Contraindicated where there 
is profuse sweating from qi deficiency, or headaches or 
cough due to yin deficiency. See ToxiCITY below. 
Actions & Indications 
• Disperses cold and releases the exterior: an adjunctive herb 
for any exterior cold pattern, especially with the addition 
of dampness or underlying yang deficiency. This herb is 
often used for externally-contracted wind-cold when the 
dominant symptoms are head and body aches. 
-
With Ephedrae Herba (rna huang) to alleviate cough and 
wheezing due to phlegm caused by wind-cold. Also to alle-
viate pain due to wind-cold-damp painful obstruction. 
... Add Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhl fo z{) for 
the lesser yin stage of this disorder, presenting with a deep 
pulse, as in Ephedra, Asarum, and Aconite Accessory Root 
Decoction (rna huang xl xfn fo zi tang). 
-
With Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) for headache due to 
trauma or wind-cold obstructing the channels. 
• Dispels wind, disperses cold, and relieves pain: for pain 
due to wind and/or cold anywhere in the body, but par-
ticularly headache, painful obstruction, abdominal pain,

or toothache. Often the conditions are marked by wind, 
cold, and dampness having obstructed the muscles to the 
point that there is no sweating and even the blood can-
not flow smoothly, as in Chuanxiong Powder to be Taken 
with Green Tea (chuan xiong chd tido scm) and Pubescent 
Angelica and Taxillus Decoction (du hu6 jz sheng tang). 
-
With Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhz fu zf), Aconiti 
Radix preparata (zhz chuan wu), Cinnamomi Ramulus (guz 
zhi), and Astragali Radix (huang qi) for painful obstruction 
with chills that is aggravated by exposure to wind or cold. 
-
With Rehmanniae Radix (sheng dl huang) for headache 
and toothache caused by wind-heat. 
-With Cinnamomi Ramulus (gul zhl) and Salviae miltior-
rhizae Radix (dan shen) for chest pain due to cold-induced 
stagnant qi. 
-With Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui) and Carthami 
Flos (hong hua) for painful breast lumps. 
• Warms the Lungs and transforms thin mucus: for cough 
and qi which surges upward, as well as fullness in the chest 
with continuous cough from clumped qi in the chest and 
diaphragm. These patterns are usually marked by cough-
ing with copious, watery sputum. For this purpose, the 
herb is often used with Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jiang) and 
Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhl bim xia), as in Minor 
Bluegreen Dragon Decoction (xiiio qlng long tang). 
-
With Schisandrae Fructus ( w6 wei zi) to protect the Lung 
from cough and wheezing due to cold-induced phlegm. 
-
With Cinnamomi Ramulus (gul zhl) and Poria (fu ling) 
for thin mucus rebelling upward and affecting the Lungs 
with wheezing and urinary difficulty. 
-With Asteris Radix (zf wiin) and Farfarae Flos (kuiin 
dong hua) for chronic persistent cough. 
• Unblocking and facilitating the orifices: for various types of 
nasal congestion, oral pathology, and some types of loss of 
consciousness, all of which impair the clear orifices of the 
head. 
-
With Chuanxiong Rhizoma ( chuan xiong), often with 
Angelicae dahuricae Radix (bai zhi), Magnoliae Flos (xln 
yi), Ligustici Rhizoma (gao ben), and Acori tatarinowii Rhi-
zoma (shi chang pu), for headache and nasal congestion 
due to wind-cold with loss of the sense of smell and profuse 
runny nasal discharge. 
-With Angelicae dahuricae Radix (bai zhi), Magnoliae 
Flos (xln yi), and Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bo he) for 
nasal congestion. 
-With Coptidis Rhizoma (huang lian), as a topical pow-
der, for mouth or tongue ulcers. 
-
As a powder blown into the nose for acute loss of con-
sciousness. 
Commentary 
The ability of Asari Radix et Rhizoma (xi xln) to induce 
sweating is rather weak, so it cannot serve as the chief herb 
in an exterior-releasing formula. Similarly, when used to 
warm the Kidney yang it is also generally used in an adjunc-
tive capacity. The perfect example of this is the formula 
Ephedra, Asarum, and Aconite Accessory Root Decoction 
(rna huang xi xln fu zf tang), where externally it assists the 
sweat-inducing action of Ephedrae Herba (rna huang), 
while internally helping Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata 
(zhl fu zi) warm the Kidneys. 
Chen Shi-Duo says of this herb: 
[It] benefits the orifices and clears phlegm, alleviates watery 
eyes from wind ... but A sari Radix et Rhizoma (xi xzn) can 
only be used in small doses, not large, and it can only be 
used in concert [with other herbs], not by itself. An exces-
sive dosage will exhaust the qi and increase the pain; used 
alone it will finish the qi and end life- there is no room for 
carelessness. 
It might be asked: Since Asari Radix et Rhizoma (xl x!n) 
can warm the Kidneys, it must be tonifying, how then can it 
disperse qi? The answer is that Asari Radix et Rhizoma (xi 
xfn) is a yang herb, rising not sinking. Although it warms 
the fire of the Kidneys below, it does not warm the water 
of the Kidneys. The nature of fire is to flare upward; Asari 
Radix et Rhizoma (xl xfn) warms the fire and thus causes it 
to ascend- this is why it cannot be used in large doses. 
Others may inquire: If Asari Radix et Rhizoma (xl xin) 
disperses true qi, how can it be effective for headaches? 
The answer is that the head is the capital of true yang; if 
clear qi rises and turbid qi descends, then the head and 
eyes are clear and crisp. It is only if turbid qi rises and clear 
qi descends that the eyes and head are heavy, aching, and 
painful. Asari Radix et Rhizoma's (xl xfn) qi is clear and not 
turbid, thus it brings down turbid qi and lifts clear qi; this is 
why it cures headaches so miraculously. 
However, its flavor is acrid and its nature is dispersing-
one must use it with herbs that tonify the blood, so that 
there is blood to prevent qi from dispersing excessively. 
There is an adage about this herb to the effect that it should 
not be used in a dosage larger than one qian (3g). However, 
this was taken out of context. The source of the adage, 
Alternative Statements in Materia Medica, refers to the use 
of the herb by itself as a powder. There are physicians who 
report good results in difficult cases using a large dosage of 
Asari Radix et Rhizoma (xi xln), but those without exten-
sive experience in the use of this herb should be wary and 
err on the side of caution. 
Some traditional herbal pharmacies use Asari Radix et 
Rhizoma (xi xin) as a non-toxic alternative to camphor for 
the preservation of herbs, especially ginseng. Small por-
tions are simply wrapped in a cotton cloth and placed in the 
corners of the storage space.

Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
;;.. WITH ACONITI RADIX LATERALIS PREPARATA (zhifu zi) 
This pair is frequently used for dispersing cold and stop-
ping pain. As explained in Rectification of the Meaning of 
Materia Medica: 
Asari Radix et Rhizoma's (xl xin) aroma is most potent, 
therefore it excels at opening clumped qi, and dissemi-
nating constraint and stagnation; it can reach the vertex, 
unblock the eyes and ears, and reach laterally to the hun-
dred articulations. There is no subtle area it does not reach: 
internally it dredges the collaterals and channels in order to 
unblock the joints, exteriorly it mobilizes the orifices of the 
pores in order to directly vent the muscles and skin. 
When the two herbs are used togetl1er, their common 
warmth combines, their ambulatory nature facilitates 
movement, and the effect is to disperse cold and alleviate 
pain. Internally, Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zh! fu zi) 
warms while Asari Radix et Rhizoma (xi x!n) draws out the 
cold and disperses it; exteriorly, Asari Radix et Rhizoma (xi 
x!n) dredges up the pathogen while Aconiti Radix lateralis 
preparata (zhl fu zi) encourages and supports this action. 
Thus, cold at any level can be completely eliminated. 
Clinically, besides treating cold damage involving both the 
exterior and interior marked by aversion to cold, headache, 
and generalized body aches with aching joints, the pair can 
also be used in treating painful obstruction from wind, 
dampness, and cold leading to spasms of the joints and 
intolerable pain. However, caution must be exercised in 
the use of these herbs due to potential side effects- if the 
condition is not one of cold from excess, iliis pair should 
be used only with considerable caution. 
;;.. WITH SCHISANDRAE FRUCTUS (wu wei zi) 
This herb is sour, warm, and specifically used for contract-
ing and preserving. It is particularly good at restraining the 
Lungs and alleviating cough. 
Together with Asari Radix et Rhizoma (xl xln), whose 
acrid, dispersing property opens the Lungs, the sour, 
restraining quality of Schisandrae Fructus (wu wei zi) pre-
serves the Lung qi: ilie first herb opens the Lungs without 
risk of exhausting its qi, while the second herb closes the 
Lungs without risk of mistakenly trapping ilie pathogenic 
qi. Thus, the pair is ideal for regulating ilie opening and 
closing of the Lungs, alleviating cough, and calming wheez-
ing. It is used for patients wiili existing iliin mucus, who are 
further exposed to externally-contracted wind-cold, leading 
to acute wheezing and coughing up of thin clear sputum. 
The relative dosage of each of ilie two herbs should be 
based upon the duration of ilie disorder and the strengili 
of the pathogen. Generally speaking, recent or early stage 
disorders have a stronger pathogen, in which case Asari 
Radix et Rhizoma (xi x!n) should be emphasized. In more 
chronic cases the pailiogen will have weakened, but so will 
the patient, and Schisandrae Fructus (wii wei zi) should be 
emphasized in order to take advantage of its Lung-preserv-
ing action. These rules are reflected in ilie adage, "For a new 
cough, use more Asari Radix et Rhizoma (xi x!n); for an old 
cough, use more Schisandrae Fructus (wii wei zi)." 
;;.. WITH CHUANXIONG RHIZOMA (chuan xiong) 
Chuanxiong Rhizoma ( chuan xiong) is acrid, and ideal for 
moving and dispersing. It can travel upward to the head, 
eyes, and vertex with a relatively powerful wind-expelling 
action to relieve pain. It is considered an essential herb for 
headaches. Asari Radix et Rhizoma (xl xln) also reaches the 
crown, and excels at unblocking the nose and ears, expel-
ling wind-cold, and relieving pain. Together, the pain-
relieving actions of these herbs are strengthened synergisti-
cally, especially for wind-cold headaches. This use has been 
extended to pain from wounds as described in Rectification 
of the Meaning of Materia Medica: 
Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chwin xiong) excels at dispersing 
and also travels in the Liver channel: a qi herb that moves 
blood .... Thus, it disperses wind-cold, treats headache, 
breaks up stagnation, unblocks the blood vessels, releases 
clumped qi, eliminates pain, expels pus, dissolves swelling, 
drives out blood, and unblocks the channels .... Decocted 
together with Asari Radix et Rhizoma (xl xln), it treats pain 
from wounds caused by metal. 
This pair can treat swelling and pain from sores and boils, 
or from trauma. Other herbs should be added based upon 
ilie nature of ilie disorder: hot, cold, excessive, or deficient. 
;;.. WITH ANGELICAE PUBESCENTIS RADIX (du hu6); 
see page 324 
Traditional Contraindications 
With its ascending, drying, and dispersing nature, Asari Radix 
et Rhizoma (xl xln) should not be used for any disorder 
involving internal heat or fire flushing upward, upper excess 
and lower deficiency, qi deficiency with sweating, blood 
deficiency headaches, [or] yin deficiency cough- all the 
methods forbid it. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
Overdosage of ilie herb, or too short of a boiling time dur-
ing decoction, can cause toxic effects. In one case, 15 grams 
of the herb (five times the suggested maximum dose), taken 
as a decoction, caused headache, nausea, diaphoresis, rest-
lessness, red face, tachypnea, accelerated pulse, elevated 
temperature, cardiac arrythmia, hypertension, opisthoto-
nus, disturbed consciousness, convulsions, dilated pupils, 
and ultimately death from respiratory paralysis. 
The toxic constituent of this herb is iliought to be saf-
role, which has shown after long-term administration to 
cause liver cancer in various animals. This is much more 
of a problem with the adulterants, which have iliree to
