## 📖 Overview

Acrid, such that it disperses, bitter, such that it drains and directs downward, and cold, such that it cools heat, Curcumae Radix (yu jin) enters the blood aspect of the Heart and Liver channels to cool heat in the Heart and blood, while also promoting the movement of qi within the blood in order to dredge and relieve Liver channel qi constraint and clumping. In Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing-Cheng observes:

Relieves constraint and expands the chest, so that the Heart and Lungs can be unblocked and the Liver restored; acridity disperses, bitterness directs downward, blood stasis is driven out, and the qi disseminated. Because it is aromatic and fragrant, it scours out phlegm from the Heart orifice; because its nature is rather cooling and drying, it treats withdrawal seizures in Liver patients.

Curcumae Radix (yu jin) is widely used for blood stasis due to heat, such as dysmenorrhea and clumping in the hypochondrium, as well as for bleeding disorders due to heat in the blood, such as nosebleed and blood in the urine. It facilitates the proper functioning of the Gallbladder to eliminate jaundice, and because of its ability to cool the Heart and relieve constraint, it is used for muddled consciousness from warm pathogen diseases, and in cases of seizures and withdrawal mania.

Essentials of the Materia Medica states that it "promotes the movement of qi, relieves constraint, cools the blood, and breaks up stasis. It treats nosebleed, and women with inverted menses (nosebleed at the onset of menstruation or instead of menstruation), and pox toxin entering the Heart."
