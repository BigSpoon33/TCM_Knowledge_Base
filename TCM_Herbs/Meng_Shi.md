6 I Herbs that Transform Phlegm and Stop Coughing 
Commentary 
By nature intense and heavy, Chloriti Lapis ( q!ng meng shi) 
has the specific actions of driving qi downward, sending 
phlegm downward and out of the body, clearing severe 
food stagnation, pacifying the Liver, and sedating convul-
sions. It is primarily used for treating cough and wheezing 
or childhood convulsions due to stubborn phlegm clogging 
and impeding the upper or middle burner. 
Encountering the Sources of the Materia Medica describes 
its characteristics: 
By nature it drives downward, treating excessive wind-
wood which takes advantage of Spleen-earth weakness so 
that qi neither transforms nor transports, but stagnates 
and produces phlegm which accumulates and impedes 
the region above the diaphragm. It can also change and 
produce wind (-phlegm] or heat [-phlegm]. Thus, this 
medicinal is appropriate for its heavy, downward-directing 
[quality], which drives downward and drains, pacifies wood 
so that its qi descends, [and thereby] the accumulated qi is 
unblocked and freed to leave the body, and thus all symp-
toms are resolved by themselves. 
This passage suggests that the mechanism of action of this 
mineral in the treatment of convulsions and the expulsion 
of phlegm are entirely based on its heavy, downward-
directing properties. 
The properties of this mineral are further elaborated 
upon in Materia Medica of Combinations: 
Chloriti Lapis/Micae Lapis au reus (meng shi) is drying and 
can expel dampness [thus] it is not actually appropriate for 
old, stubborn phlegm. But when all other herbs have been 
employed to moisten and cause the phlegm to slip away 
downward, there may still remain phlegm lurking at the 
deepest hidden locations, which has not been reached. Only 
Chloriti Lapis/Micae Lapis aureusi (meng shi) with its harsh 
ferocity can seek out and sweep clear the root of phlegm 
from the areas hidden deep in the twists and turns of the 
bowels. It prevents the turbid, filthy grease of obstructing 
phlegm from becoming a bilge that is retained below the 
Stomach and which is therefore known by the name of 
roiling phlegm [itt~ giin tan]. 
Yet phlegm stagnation can [also] arise from blood defi-
ciency, which is unable to moisten, or from qi deficiency, 
which is unable to escort and move, and because of these 
conditions-a lack of moistening and lack of motility-the 
phlegm adheres and stagnates in the Stomach, taking up 
residence in the midst of the bowels, and the ileocecal 
gate actually becomes a receptacle for the accumulation of 
phlegm. If Chloriti Lapis/Micae Lapis aureus (meng shi) 
is then used in this circumstance to direct qi downward, 
then [because of the deficiency underlying the disorder] 
the phlegm will become more inhibited and the qi depleted 
further, ending in a congealed clump in the center which 
cannot be released. How can one fail to carefully investigate 
[before initiating treatment)? 
Comparisons 
);> Vs. HAEMATITUM (dai zhe shi) 
Both substances are heavy minerals with a sinking nature 
that drives downward, and both pacify the Liver, sedate 
convulsions, direct rebellious qi downward, and scour out 
phlegm. However, Chloriti Lapis (q!ng meng shi) is more 
intense in action than Haematitum (dai zhe shi). It is also 
salty and specifically mobilizes the alimentary tract, clear-
ing it of phlegm and food stagnation; thus, by removing the 
source of phlegm, it can clear the channels of the Lungs, 
Liver, and Stomach. By contrast, Haematitum (dai zhe shi) 
is bitter, sweet, and neutral. While it tends to mobilize the 
qi passageways, it also enters the blood level, and is particu-
larly effective in suppressing rebellious qi in the Penetrating 
vessel and extinguishing Liver wind, while also cooling 
the blood and stopping bleeding. It is a valued mineral for 
sedating the Liver and directing rebellious qi downward. It 
primarily affects the channels of the Liver, Stomach, and 
Pericardium. 
Traditional Contraindications 
Chloriti Lapis/Micae Lapis aureus (meng shi) is contrain-
dicated for Spleen deficiency, weak qi, fever, hoarse voice, 
and phlegm mixed with blood. The best quality is blue-
green. If there is no sparkle, it cannot be used for medicinal 
purposes. Add an equal amount of saltpetre and calcine 
until the saltpetre is eliminated and the color is golden. 
Then grind into a powder, use aqueous trituration, and dry 
in the sun before using. (Materia Medica of Combinations) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
There are two different minerals used as .b~ ;t; meng shf 
in the Chinese materia medica. They are basically inter-
changeable, but Chloriti Lapis ( -k t't;t; q!ng meng shi) is 
considered to be of better quality. We have followed the 
practice of recent Chinese Pharmacopoeia and separated 
them. In texts where it is unclear which product is referred 
to, we will translate references to meng shi as Chloriti Lapis/ 
Micae Lapis aureus (meng shi) to make it clear that the ref-
erence is imprecise. 
);> BLUEGREEN meng shi ( * 
.b~;G q!ng meng shi) 
This is the standard substance and is considered to be 
the best quality. Some feel that because of its green color, 
it enters the Liver and has a stronger ability to suppress 
pain and sedate convulsions; they will thus often use it for 
symptoms such as phlegm accumulation and childhood 
convulsions. 
);> CALCINED meng shi (;ltt.b~;t; duim meng shi) 
Also known as calcined stone (;ltt/G duim shf), this is the 
form that is generally taken internally. There are two
