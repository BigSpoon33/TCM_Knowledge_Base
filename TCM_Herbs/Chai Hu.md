## 📖 Overview

Entering the Gallbladder, Liver, Pericardium, and Triple Burner channels, Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) is bitter, acrid, cool, and light in weight so that it raises and disperses to vent the exterior and drain heat. This raising action also raises the clear qi of the Stomach and Gallbladder, and in conjunction with its acrid dispersal, restores the normal movement of Liver qi in order to relieve Liver qi constraint.

Materia medica texts both ancient and modern seem to be equally divided on the question of whether to classify Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) as neutral or cool. The problem appears to have begun with the Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica, which listed it as "bitter and neutral," while most of its applications in the equally revered but slightly later Discussion of Cold Damage involve heat. Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica puts the case as follows:

The use of Bupleuri Radix lies in its cooling dispersal, which pacifies Liver heat. Because its nature is cool, it thus releases alternating chills and fever, tidal heat in the muscle layer and exterior, fire blazing in the Liver and Gallbladder, painful clumping in the chest and flanks, and also treats sores and heat in the blood chamber.

Because of this division of opinion, most texts choose one side, then note an authority which states the other; or, like the and Materia Medica Arranged According to Pattern Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica, opt for both and simply say "neutral and slightly cool."

As to its other effects, Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) has a rising, spreading, and draining nature with a relatively good heat-clearing action, particularly for eliminating a pathogen at the lesser yang half-interior, half-exterior level. It also lifts the yang qi and regulates Liver qi to relieve constraint.

The range of symptoms that this herb addresses is remarkably broad, including the alternating chills and fever associated with a lesser yang stage pathogen, prolapse or diarrhea resulting from the sinking of yang qi, distending pain in the chest and flanks plus menstrual irregularity due to Liver qi constraint, skin conditions, and diseases of the eye and ear.

In addition to the most common uses of Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) discussed above, a few others deserve comment.

**HEAT FROM DEFICIENCY**

There are two common ways that Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) is used for this purpose. The first is for treating deficiency consumption with steaming bones and tidal fever, where Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) is used because of its broad cooling effect on the Liver, Gallbladder, Heart, and Pericardium. The second is for raising yang and dispersing fire so as to spread and expel heat in the muscle layer and skin; this is referred to in the adage, "Constrained fire should be discharged." Li Shi-Zhen noted that "when there is deficiency consumption in the Spleen and Stomach with heat, or yang qi sinking downward, then Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) is the only herb to guide clear qi and reduce fever: it is absolutely necessary." Usually, it will be combined with Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng ma), Puerariae Radix (ge gen), Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng), Paeoniae Radix alba (bai shao), and Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cao), as in Raise the Yang and Disperse Fire Decoction (sheng yang san huo tang).

**GYNECOLOGICAL DISORDERS**

This herb is very commonly used in treating women's disorders. Li Gao pointed out that it "focuses on blood in the yin organs, while in the channels it focuses on qi," which makes it a perfect choice for gynecological disorders, where qi and blood regulation is paramount. It can regulate menstruation, treat heat entering the blood chamber, relieve qi constraint, cool puerperal fever, and accomplish many other tasks, if properly assisted. In gynecology, great emphasis is placed on differentiating qi and blood pathologies and determining the degree of heat or cold; thus, herbs to assist Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) will also be chosen according to these criteria.

For example, for Liver qi constraint, Cyperi Rhizoma (xiang fu), Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chuan xiong), or Citri reticulatae Pericarpium (chen pi) might be selected, while for blood stagnation, Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui), Persicae Semen (tao ren), or Carthami Flos (hong hua) would be best. If the constraint generates heat, Gardeniae Fructus (zhi zi), Moutan Cortex (mu dan pi), Scutellariae Radix (huang qin), or Paeoniae Radix rubra (chi shao) can be used. If cold is involved, Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jiang), Evodiae Fructus (wu zhu yu), Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui zhi), or Zanthoxyli Pericarpium (hua jiao) would be selected. For blood deficiency, Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) might be combined with Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di huang), Paeoniae Radix alba (bai shao), Lycii Fructus (gou qi zi), or Corni Fructus (shan zhu yu). And if there is qi deficiency, Ginseng Radix (ren shen), Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu), Poria (fu ling), and Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata (zhi gan cao) would be the herbs of choice.

**OTHER USES**

For boils and furuncles, Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) is used to disperse clumped qi and blood in all the channels. Li Gao notes that it is similar to Forsythiae Fructus (lian qiao) in that way, but must be accompanied by reducing and dispersing herbs. Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) is a commonly used herb for eye and ear diseases, because it enters the lesser yang and terminal yin channels to disperse heat and fire, and can be used as a guiding herb into those areas. Important Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces combines Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) with Cassiae Semen (jue ming zi) to treat blurry vision, while Secrets of the Orchid Chamber combines it with Citri reticulatae viride Pericarpium (qing pi), Atractylodis Rhizoma (cang zhu), Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui), and Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) in several eye disease formulas. For early stage deafness and tinnitus, Unblock the Qi Powder (tong qi san) uses equal amounts of Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) and Cyperi Rhizoma (xiang fu) with Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chuan xiong) at half the amount.
