## 📖 Overview

Bitter, cold, and downward-directing, Dianthi Herba (qu mai) is slippery by nature. It enters the blood level of the Heart channel to break up stasis and disperse clumps, and also enters the Small Intestine to guide heat downward and out through the urine. This dual action gives Dianthi Herba (qu mai) a special significance in the treatment of painful urinary dribbling; and because of its blood-invigorating quality, it can be used for other disorders due to blood stasis, such as amenorrhea. Because it leads heat in the lower burner downward and out of the body, it can also be used for gynecological toxic swellings and sores.

In Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, Zhang Jie-Bin notes that this herb
is slippery and facilitating by nature, and can unblock urination, direct yin fire downward, eradicate the five types of painful urinary dribbling, and facilitate movement in the blood vessels. Together with cooling herbs, it can reduce swelling and pain in the eyes; together with blood [invigorating] herbs, it can promote menstruation, break up blood stasis, and abort a fetus. It can be used for all disorders involving lower burner damp-heat with aching pain.
