## 📖 Overview

Curcumae Rhizoma (e zhu) enters the Liver and Spleen channels, which defines its range of activity: to act on the qi, blood, food stagnation, and phlegm. This also defines its theater of application: the abdomen, flanks, and hypochondria. Its acrid flavor disperses, its bitterness drains, its warmth unblocks, and its solid texture and weight ensures that it reaches the blood aspect, while its aroma promotes the flow of qi.

In Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing-Cheng observes:

Acrid and bitter, [this herb] enters the Liver and Spleen to break up qi, promote movement in stasis, and grind away accumulations. Warm and aromatic, it dredges the yin and yang organs, expels phlegm, disperses stagnation, and drives out congealed cold.

Proceeding, he says that it

is an herb of the qi aspect of the Liver channel; it can break up blood in the qi aspect. Acrid, bitter, and warm, with a hard, violent nature, it excels at conquering by whittling away. It attacks delineated lumps and accumulations in the hypochondrium, abdomen, and xuan pi, congealed blood and stagnant qi, and is almost always used together with Sparganii Rhizoma (san leng). If concerned about its harshness, it should be dry-fried with vinegar before use.

Note: Recently, this has become an important herb in the treatment of solid cancers, particularly of the cervix.

Especially useful for dysmenorrhea and amenorrhea accompanied by a painful fixed abdominal mass, emotional depression, and a wiry pulse.
Dissolves accumulations and alleviates pain: for pain, distention, fullness, and constriction in the chest and abdomen due to food stagnation. Also for childhood nutritional impairment.
