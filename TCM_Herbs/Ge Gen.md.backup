## 📖 Overview

Puerariae Radix (ge gen) is sweet, acrid, neutral, and enters the Spleen and Stomach channels with a marked raising and dispersing effect. It can lift qi and fluids, and disperse externally-contracted pathogenic qi from the muscle layer of the exterior. Li Shi-Zhen's Grand Materia Medica observes:

Puerariae Radix (ge gen) is thin in nature and flavor, light and travelling upward, but within this floating is a slight directing-downward action: yin within yang. Its uses are four: 1) to stop thirst; 2) resolve toxicity; 3) disperse exterior pathogens; and 4) bring out rashes and sores which have trouble expressing.

The most cogent description of the herb's scope of action is found in Records of Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica:

[A]ny time pathogenic cold has blocked a channel, and the pathogen shows a tendency to transform but cannot, and there are symptoms of exterior heat, then Puerariae Radix (ge gen) can reach out to the exterior and release it. If the pathogen has already transformed into heat and entered the interior, or its heat is not suitable to be released through the exterior, then Puerariae Radix (ge gen) is of no use.

Zhou Yan, in the course of his discussion of Ephedrae Herba (ma huang), explains Puerariae Radix (ge gen) in more detail:

When the greater yang stage is about to become the yang brightness stage of an exterior disease, Puerariae Radix (ge gen) is essential. Zhang Zhong-Jing's writings must be looked at repeatedly and cross-referenced; an understanding comes with time. For example, the indications for Kudzu Decoction (ge gen tang) are greater yang stage disease, stiff neck and back, absence of sweating, and aversion to wind. Although it says "greater yang," the formula emphasizes Puerariae Radix (ge gen) in its name! This is because Puerariae Radix (ge gen) is a herb for the transition between the greater yang stage and the yang brightness stage. Why is this?

Yang brightness stage disease presents with fever and profuse sweating, while Puerariae Radix (ge gen) treats high fever without treating profuse sweating- but it does release the muscle layer with sweating. Although it induces sweating, it does not disperse an early greater yang stage cold pathogen. That is why it is a herb for treating a greater yang stage [disease] that is just about to become a yang brightness stage [disease].

When a greater yang stage cold pathogen becomes hot, the heat parches the yin fluids such that the nape and upper back stiffen. Puerariae Radix (ge gen) brings up the yin qi to moisten and restore lubrication so that what is stiff becomes soft.

For more information concerning the lifting of yin qi to moisten, see the passage from Zhou Yan quoted in the COMPARISONS section below.

## ⚡ Functions & Actions

- Discharges exterior conditions and releases the muscles: for exterior disorders lodged in the muscles manifesting in fever, headache, and stiff or tight upper back and neck.
- Relieves heat and generates fluids: for thirst due to Stomach heat. Especially appropriate in cases of externally-contracted heat.
  - With Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) for externally-contracted wind-heat. Usually, Scutellariae Radix (huang qin) is added, as in Bupleurum and Kudzu Decoction to Release the Muscle Layer (chai ge jie ji tang).
  - With Ephedrae Herba (ma huang), Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui zhi), and Paeoniae Radix alba (bai shao) for externally-contracted wind-cold with stiffness and tension in the upper back and neck, as in Kudzu Decoction (ge gen tang).
- Vents and discharges measles: to hasten recovery from measles with incomplete expression of the rash.
  - With Cimicifugae Rhizoma (sheng ma) for measles in the early stages where the rash has not yet appeared; often more effective when Schizonepetae Herba (jing jie) and Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bo he) are added.
- Relieves heat and generates fluids: for irritability and thirst from externally-contracted heat or wasting and thirsting diseases with internal heat.
- Raises the yang and stops diarrhea: for diarrhea or dysenteric disorders due to heat. Can also be used for diarrhea due to Spleen deficiency, when combined with appropriate herbs.
  - With Coptidis Rhizoma (huang lian) and Scutellariae Radix (huang qin) for heat-induced diarrhea and dysenteric disorders due to damp-heat, as in Kudzu, Scutellaria, and Coptis Decoction (ge gen huang qin huang lian tang).
  - With Dioscoreae Rhizoma (shan yao) for diarrhea due to heat where the fluids are injured.
  - With Ginseng Radix (ren shen) and Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu) for chronic diarrhea due to Spleen and Stomach qi deficiency, as in Seven-Ingredient Powder with White Atractylodes (qi wei bai zhu san).
- Treats symptoms of hypertension: this herb has recently been used to treat the headache, dizziness, tinnitus, or paresthesias that can accompany hypertension.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
If a pathogen has not yet entered the yang brightness stage, this [herb] can lead the pathogen inside- it [therefore] cannot be used. Only if the pathogen is in the greater yang stage and there are already a few symptoms of the yang brightness stage, then the important thing is to defend the yang brightness. Puerariae Radix (ge gen) must be used to cut off the pathogen's route of attack. (Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica)

Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica repeats this warning, and then elaborates:

Also, if rashes and sores have already expressed red spots, Puerariae Radix (ge gen) should not be used for fear that the exterior will be further weakened and the lesions will worsen. People with exhaustion, or excess in the upper body and deficiency in the lower, should not take it, and it should not be taken in the summer, even if there are Spleen and Stomach disorders; this is especially true for those already sweating excessively. When it is used, it should be in small doses to avoid injuring the Stomach qi from its excessive raising and dispersing.

Puerariae Radix (ge gen) is a wind herb, all of which are drying. When Divine Husbandman's Classic says that it 'generates fluids and stops thirst'; this is a misprint for 'raises fluids.' It is not that Puerariae Radix (ge gen) itself can alleviate thirst; it all depends on its raising the Stomach qi up into the Lungs so that fluids can be generated. So if the thirst does not result from the inability of clear yang to ascend, but rather from fire drying and exhausting the fluids, then mistakenly consuming this wind herb will find the wind fanning the flames and boiling away the source qi.
