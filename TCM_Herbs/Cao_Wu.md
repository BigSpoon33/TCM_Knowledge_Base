);> PROCESSED SICHUAN AcoNITE MAIN RooT 
(~ Jll .~ zhl chuan wu) 
The root is soaked in water until no longer spicy or 
numbing to the tongue, then it is boiled together with 
Glycyrrhizae Radix (gem cao) and Glycine max (hei diJU) 
(and, in some places, bean curd) until the center is no lon-
ger white. The root is then sliced and dried in the sun. This 
method of preparation greatly reduces its toxicity, making 
it acrid and warm, and excellent for expelling wind, elimi-
nating dampness, dispersing cold, and stopping pain. This 
is the form that will be dispensed whenever Jll .~ chuan wu 
is prescribed. 
);> DRY-FRIED SICHUAN AcoNITE MAIN RooT 
(:ky Jll .~ chao chuan wu) 
The sliced herb is dry-fried at a high temperature until it 
begins to swell and split. It is then removed from the wok 
and left to cool, then dry-fried in like manner again. This 
procedure is repeated several times. This method of prepa-
ration was popular in ancient times, as it quickly reduced 
the toxicity of the raw herb, but it is not commonly used 
now. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of dry, full, heavy, and solid main 
roots, without a hollow center.

Commentary 
Acrid, hot, and toxic, Aconiti kusnezoffii Radix preparata 
(zhl cao wu) searches out wind, overcomes dampness, 
disperses cold, stops pain, unbinds areas constrained by 
phlegm, and reduces swelling. It is often used in the treat-
ment of painful obstruction due to wind, dampness, and 
cold, hemiplegia from wind-stroke, headache, cold pain in

the abdomen, gathered accumulations of phlegm and qi, 
cold dysenteric disorder, scrofula, and ulcerations. 
As noted in the entry for Aconiti Radix lateralis pre-
parata (zhl fu zi), we recommend that only Aconiti kusne-
zoffii Radix preparata (zhl cao wu) obtained from reliable 
sources be used to guard against the possibility that the 
herb might contain more than the standard amount of 
toxic ingredients. For the most part, however, because of 
its toxicity, the herb is used externally; the main issue here 
is its unpredictability owing to the variety of species and 
areas of collection. 
Toxicity 
This herb is highly toxic, and is only to be used after 
processing. The main causes of toxicity are the use of the 
unprocessed herb, or improperly processed herb, overdos-
age, or decocting for too short a time. Due to the high alco-
hol solubility and quick absorption of aconitine-alkaloids, 
medicinal wines made of unprocessed Aconiti kusnezoffii 
Radix (sheng cao wu) are extremely toxic when taken inter-
nally. There are reports of toxic reactions after ingestion of 
as little 0.3g of the unprocessed drug in a medicinal wine, 
and of acute renal failure after ingestion of 10-20ml of 
medicinal wine made of the unprocessed herb. There is one 
report of a patient having died three hours after ingestion 
of 60g of the processed herb. For symptoms of poisoning, 
see Aconiti Radix preparata. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "prepared herbal raven" 
This herb is prepared in the same manner as Aconiti 
Radix preparata (zhl chuiin wu). Investigation has shown 
that different methods of preparation, and even different 
conditions within the same method, will yield quite differ-
ent results in terms of reducing the highly toxic alkaloid 
content. While all of the various methods of preparation 
used at present reduce the herb's toxicity to some extent, 
the most successful is steam preparation under high pres-
sure, which brings the toxic alkaloids to the lowest level. 
Interestingly, the higher the temperature and pressure, the 
lower the toxic alkaloid content, but the overall alkaloid 
level remains fairly stable. 
The toxicity of the unprepared aconite species is taken 
very seriously throughout the world, including China. 
Commerce in, and use of, all unprepared aconite species is 
restricted under the poison laws in China. Even for external 
use, a physician must sign the prescription twice. In herbal 
warehouses it is stored in rooms with two locks with differ-
ent keys, and cannot be handed over to one individual; only 
two people together can enter the room. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality processed herb has a blackish, translucent, 
and horny surface on cross section. Good quality unpro-
cessed herb consists of full, heavy, and solid roots, white 
and powdery on cross section, with no remaining stems or 
hairy rootlets. 
Major known chemical constituents 
Alkaloids: aconitine, mesaconitine, hypaconitine, 3-deoxyaconi-
tine, isoaconitine, jesaconitine, beiwutine, higenamine, lepenine, 
denudine 
Other constituents: monoglycerides, polysaccharides

11 I Herbs that Warm the Interior and Expel Cold 
KEY CHARACTERISTICS 
warms the Spleen, transforms thin 
mucus, unblocks the channels, revives the yang 
DOSAGE 
3-9g 
CAUTIONS & (ONTRAINDICATIONS 
Contraindicated when 
there is internal heat from yin deficiency or when heat in 
the blood leads to bleeding. Use with caution during preg-
nancy. 
Actions & Indications 
• Warms the middle and expels cold: for warming the Spleen 
and Stomach both in conditions of excess due to exter-
nally-contracted cold, as well as cold from deficiency due 
to insufficiency of the yang qi. Also dispels wind and damp-
ness that seep into the lower burner. 
-
With Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bdi zhU) for 
diarrhea associated with Spleen deficiency. Char both herbs 
for treating bloody stools and excessive uterine bleeding. 
.. . Add Ginseng Radix (ren shen) for Spleen yang defi-
ciency with a cold abdomen, vomiting, and diarrhea, as in 
Regulate the Middle Pill (li zhang wan). 
-
With Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhl fu zi) for 
debilitated Spleen and Kidney yang with incessant diar-
rhea. 
-
With Coptidis Rhizoma (huang lidn) for epigastric pain 
and distention, dysenteric disorders, and indefinable epi-
gastric discomfort. The latter is a disorder characterized by 
a feeling of hunger, vague abdominal pain or discomfort, 
sometimes accompanied by belching, distention, and nau-
sea which gradually culminates in pain. 
... Add Asini Corii Colla (e jiao) for chronic diarrhea 
with damage to the yin leading to a condition with mixed 
hot and cold and blood and pus in the stool. 
-
With Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhl bim xia) for 
vomiting due to cold-induced congested fluids. 
-
With Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cao) for epigastric pain 
and vomiting due to cold from deficiency of the Stomach 
and Spleen. 
-
With Alpiniae officinarum Rhizoma (gao lidngjiang) for 
abdominal pain and vomiting due to Stomach cold. 
-
With Poria (fu ling) and Atractylodis macrocephalae 
Rhizoma (bdi zhu) for cold-dampness in the lower burner 
leading to a sense of heaviness and cold in the lower back, 
as in Licorice, Ginger, Poria, and White Atractylodes 
Decoction (gan cao gan jiangfu ling bdi zhu tang). 
• Rescues devastated yang and expels interior cold: for dev-
astated yang with such signs as a very weak pulse and cold 
limbs. 
-
With Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhl fu zi) for 
devastated yang. Not only does this combination have a 
synergistic warming effect, it also reduces the toxicity of the 
aconite. See Frigid Extremities Decoction (sl nl tang). 
• Warms the Lungs and transforms thin mucus: because this 
herb warms the Spleen and dries dampness while simulta-
neously scattering cold in the Lungs, it is used for Lung cold 
with expectoration of thin, watery, or white sputum. 
-
With Schisandrae Fructus (wu wei zi) and Asari Radix 
et Rhizoma (xl xin) for cough and wheezing due to cold 
congested fluids preventing the normal descent of the Lung 
qi, as in Minor Bluegreen Dragon Decoction (xiao qing long 
tang). 
-
With Gleditsiae Fructus (zao jid) for rebellious qi lead-
ing to cough. 
-
With Magnoliae officinalis Cortex (hOu po) for epigastric 
distention and pain due to cold-induced congealed fluids. 
• Warms the channels and stops bleeding: for cold from 
deficiency that may present with hemorrhage of various 
types, especially uterine bleeding. It is used in treating hem-
orrhage only if the bleeding is chronic and pale in color, 
and is accompanied by cold limbs, ashen white face, and a 
soggy, thin pulse. For bleeding, usually Zingiberis Rhizoma 
preparatum (pdo jiang) is used. 
-
With Artemisiae argyi Folium (iii ye) and Atractylodis 
macrocephalae Rhizoma (bdi zhu) for bleeding due to cold 
from deficiency. 
Commentary 
The older winter rhizome used for Zingiberis Rhizoma 
(gan jiang) is considered the 'mother' rhizome, in contrast 
to the young, tender summer rhizome used for Zingiberis 
Rhizoma recens (shengjiang), which is the 'child'. It is yel-
lowish white in color, acrid, warm and drying, and quite 
solid in texture. All of these qualities indicate an affiliation
