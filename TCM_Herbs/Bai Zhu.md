## 📖 Overview

The sweet warmth of *Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma* (bai zhu) tonifies the Spleen earth, its bitterness dries dampness, and its aromatic quality supports the transportive and transformative functions of the Spleen. It is therefore an essential herb for tonifying the Spleen and Stomach when dampness obstructs the middle burner. Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica observes:

Its nature is very warm, so that taking it strengthens the Spleen and digestion-it is the most important medicinal for tonifying the Spleen organ. Each organ has [both] yin and yang, *Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma* (bai zhu) tonifies the Spleen yang, so it tonifies the qi.

In Pouch of Pearls, Zhang Yuan-Su gives perhaps the best summation of its actions:

[It] expels dampness to augment the qi, harmonizes the middle to tonify the yang, reduces illness, drives out water, generates fluids to alleviate thirst, stops diarrhea and dysenteric disorders, and reduces swelling of the legs and calves due to dampness.

The reference to its ability to generate fluids is drawn from the Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica and seems puzzling, but Hidden Aspects of Materia Medica explains:

Since *Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma* (bai zhu) is drying, how can the [Divine Husbandman's] Classic say that it generates fluids? It is because the Spleen is averse to dampness. Once Spleen dampness prevails, the qi is unable to transform: from where might fluids be generated? Thus it is said: the Bladder is the dwelling of the yin fluids and yang fluids, from which they exit [by virtue of] qi transformation. [This function of qi transformation explains] the present usage of *Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma* (bai zhu) to dry dampness and allow the qi to circulate, so that the fluids, following qi transformation, might be generated.

This may also explain a modern usage of this herb in which a large dose of *Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma* (bai zhu), either by itself or combined with *Rehmanniae Radix* (sheng di huang) and *Cimicifugae Rhizoma* (sheng ma), is used to improve the transportive function of the Spleen in the treatment of constipation, by unblocking the bowels. The dosage for this purpose is 60-120g.

This herb has other notable qualities: it halts spontaneous sweating, and calms the fetus in pregnancy. Most materia medica texts agree that the spontaneous sweating referred to here is the result of dampness obstructing the flesh and preventing the harmonious interaction of the nutritive and protective qi; the interstices and pores then become disordered, and sweating occurs randomly. This herb clears earth dampness-the earth includes the muscles and flesh-and thereby restores harmony and halts the sweating.

Regarding the ability of this herb to calm the fetus in pregnancy, Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica explains: "Fetal qi is linked to the Spleen; if the Spleen is deficient then the Girdle [vessel] has no support. Thus, miscarriage readily occurs." *Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma* (bai zhu) is usually combined with *Scutellariae Radix* (huang qin) for this purpose, as that herb deals with the other major cause of miscarriage-heat.
