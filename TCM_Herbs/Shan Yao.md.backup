## 📖 Overview

Sweet and neutral, harmonious and moderating in nature, *Dioscoreae Rhizoma* (shan yao) both tonifies the qi and nourishes the yin. Moreover, it has no cloying quality at all, which means that it does not obstruct the digestion. It nourishes the yin of the Lungs, Spleen, and Kidneys, and has a mild astringent quality that stops diarrhea, secures the essence, and inhibits urinary frequency. Not only does *Dioscoreae Rhizoma* (shan yao) directly tonify the Lungs, Spleen, and Kidneys, it also has an indirect, cumulative effect resulting from the gradual strengthening of metal, which then generates earth, which in turn generates water. Because of its mild astringent quality, which inhibits and restrains, these gains are retained as essence and not lost. Although the herb thus has a wide range of actions, it is most appropriate for diarrhea and poor appetite due to Spleen and Stomach deficiency, cough and wheezing due to Lung qi and yin deficiency, and urinary frequency or spermatorrhea due to Kidney qi and yin deficiency. It is also used for vaginal discharge, and for wasting and thirsting disorder.

Nevertheless, the relative strength of *Dioscoreae Rhizoma* (shan yao) must be borne in mind. It is a commonly consumed food as well as a medicine, which means that its nature is particularly harmonious. And like foods that serve as herbs, one should not expect quick results. That is what is meant when the Divine Husbandman's Classic emphasizes that long-term consumption is appropriate. Taken over an extended period of time, the effects will gently accumulate.

The Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica states that the herb governs injury to the middle, tonifies deficiency, eliminates cold and hot pathogenic qi, tonifies the middle and augments the power of qi, and increases the muscle. Long-term consumption sharpens the hearing, brightens the eyes, and lightens the body.

The Grand Materia Medica says that it can "augment the Kidney qi, strengthen the Spleen and Stomach, stop diarrhea and dysenteric disorders, transform phlegm and thick saliva, and moisten the skin." Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica notes that it "strengthens the Spleen, tonifies deficiency, enriches the essence, secures the Kidneys, treats all deficiency, and remedies consumption and [internal] injuries."
