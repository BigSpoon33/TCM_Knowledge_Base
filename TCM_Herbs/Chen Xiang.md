## 📖 Overview

Aquilariae Lignum Resinatum (沉香, chén xiāng) sinks and directs downward, but is not overly draining, nor is its warmth overly drying. Thus it can warm the middle and direct rebellious qi downward, while also warming the Kidneys to grasp qi. Because it promotes the flow of qi, disperses coldness, directs downward and stops nausea, it is often used in the treatment of cold constraint with clumping qi which leads to a stifling sensation in the chest and abdominal distention, belching, hiccough, nausea, and vomiting. Because it assists the Kidneys in grasping the qi, it calms wheezing due to Kidney deficiency. The Kidneys also store essence and control lower body elimination; thus, when the Kidney yang is deficient, the essence lacks warmth, urination can become difficult, and stools become loose. For these conditions, too, Aquilariae Lignum Resinatum (沉香, chén xiāng) is appropriate. On the other hand, it is also frequently used for constipation due to qi stagnation or Liver qi constraint (particularly in young women) when combined with such herbs as Aucklandiae Radix (木香, mù xiāng), Arecae Semen (槟榔, bīng láng), Aurantii Fructus Immaturus (枳实, zhǐ shí), and Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (大黄, dà huáng), as in Six Milled-Herb Decoction (六磨汤, liù mò tāng), and for constipation due to Kidney yang deficiency.

Penetrating the Mysteries of the Materia Medica observes that this herb is warm without being drying, promotes movement without draining, supports the Spleen so that transportation is not fatigued, and reaches the Kidneys to guide fire back to its base. Its action in directing downward does not break up the qi and [thereby] cause harm. It is truly a fine substance.

### Mechanisms of Selected Combinations

**WITH AUCKLANDIAE RADIX (木香, mù xiāng)**

This combination is used for rebellious middle burner qi with belching, hiccough, nausea and vomiting; or for urinary difficulty due to forced retention of urine or excessively repressed sexual activity. It has a strong qi-regulating action, particularly appropriate for directing rebellious middle burner qi downward, and is often used in the treatment of epigastric and abdominal distention, stifling sensation in the epigastrium, with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, belching, and hiccough. It is often combined with herbs that otherwise regulate the qi, or those that tonify the Spleen and Stomach.

There was also an interesting ancient application for this combination. Excessive repression of sexual urges, or extended forced retention of urine, was believed to cause 'twisting of the bladder' (膀胱转, páng guāng zhuǎn), which in turn led to urinary difficulty. Customary herbs for facilitating urination could not resolve the disorder. This combination was therefore prescribed, taken as a powder on an empty stomach with boiled water, to disperse the clumping and guide the qi downward and outward, thereby unblocking the Bladder.
