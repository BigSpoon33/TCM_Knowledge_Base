After topical administration, this substance can cause 
strong irritation of the skin and mucosa. Topical applica-
tion on the face can cause conjunctival congestion. Allergic 
reactions have also been reported after topical administra-
tion with such symptoms as flushing of the skin, pruritus, 
papular eruption, urticaria, shortness of breath, palpita-
tions, dizziness, and, in severe cases, anaphylactic shock. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "crow gallbladder seed" 
This is the ripe seed, cleaned of extraneous material. When 
the outer husk is scraped off it is called brucea seed kernels 
(f.~ !lit -f1-=- yii dan z{ ren). While it is sometimes referred 
to as bitter root seeds (% 1--f kii shen zi), it should not be 
confused with the seed of Sophorae flavescentis Radix (kii 
shen). 
>
DEFATTED BRUCEA FRUIT, lit. 'brucea fruit frost' 
(yii dan z{ shuiing) 
The fruit kernels are wrapped in oil-absorbent paper 
and then pressed. The paper is replaced and the process 
repeated until no more oil can be expressed. This defatting 
process greatly reduces its toxicity, and the resulting prepa-
ration can be taken without causing nausea and vomiting; 
note, however, that its medicinal effect is correspondingly 
reduced. This is appropriate for older and weaker patients, 
and for children. It will have almost no effect if used exter-
nally. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of big, full fruits with white, oily 
seeds inside.

Commentary 
Sour, cold, and slippery in texture, Portulacae Herba (rna 
chi xian) enters the Liver and Large Intestine channels and 
acts to cool heat toxin, cool the blood, and reduce swell-
ings. It is thus used for toxic boils, abscesses, furuncles, 
and similar lesions. Its slippery nature expels accumulated 
foulness, while also cooling heat and cooling the blood. It 
is very good for treating dysentery, especially where colicky 
tenesmus persists after bowel movements. It is also used for 
vaginal discharge and painful urinary dribbling disorder 
due to heat. 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica explains 
its nature: 
Its leaves are unusually thick, as is its stalk; [so) on the hot-
test day it does not easily dry up. It is readily seen that its 
nature is pure yin cold, and thus it excels at resolving swol-
len sores and heat toxin; it can also be applied externally . 
. . . The leaves of this plant, likewise, are green on the face 
but purplish red on the back, and its stalk is also purple, 
thus it enters the blood level and breaks up stasis and stag-
nant blood disorders. 
The Grand Materia Medica says that Portulacae Herba (rna 
chi xian) 
disperses blood, reduces swelling, and eases the Intestines, 
terminates pregnancy, resolves toxicity, and unblocks 
painful urinary dribbling disorder. ... All of the disorders 
primarily treated by Portulacae Herba (rna ch! xicm) draw 
upon its ability to disperse blood and reduce swelling. 
However, in Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Med-
ica, Zhang Shan-Lei takes issue with this explanation. Of all 
of these symptoms, he says, "not a single one cannot but be 
credited to the two words 'cold' and 'slippery'." 
Many materia medica texts discuss the external appli-
cation of Portulacae Herba (rna chi xian). The Materia 
Medica of the Kaibao Era advises that, for deep-rooted 
sores, Portulacae Herba (rna chi xian) should be "roasted 
into ash, then mixed with aged vinegar; first moxa [the 
sore], then cover it [with the mixture of charred Portulacae 
Herba (rna chi xian) and vinegar]. This will eliminate the 
root. Decocted into a paste, it can be applied to bald spots." 
For early stage hemorrhoids, the Grand Materia Medica 
recommends "Portulacae Herba (rna chi xian)-either 
dried or fresh-boiled until thoroughly cooked, then eaten. 
Use the leftover water to steam the area. Used thusly inter-
nally and externally for a month, the cavity will close and 
be cured." Important Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold 
Pieces has a similar formula for chronic hemorrhoids; and 
the Grand Materia Medica notes that, "for extreme swelling 
and pain of the genitals, pound and apply Portulacae Herba 
(rna chi xian): it has fine results." 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
~ WITH PULSATILLAE RADIX (bai t6u weng) 
Because of their closely related actions, these two herbs 
work extremely well together in treating dysenteric dis-
orders due to heat toxin. Portulacae Herba (rna chi xian) 
is slippery and expels accumulated foulness while cooling 
heat. Pulsatillae Radix (bai t6u weng) is cold and bitter, 
which drains away obstructed heat in the Intestines.
