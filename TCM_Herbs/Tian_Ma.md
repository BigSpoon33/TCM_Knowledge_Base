Commentary 
Sweet, neutral, and moist, with a nature that is slightly 
moistening and tonifying, Gastrodiae Rhizoma (tiiin md) 
enters the Liver channel to nourish the yin fluids, calm the 
Liver, and extinguish wind. Considered a sage-like herb 
for wind, it treats all forms of internal wind, including 
problems such as wind-stroke, wind-seizures, tingling and 
numbness, headache, vertigo, and dizziness. Transforming 
the Significance of Medicinal Substances says that it "is har-
monious and moderate in nature. The [Inner] Classic says 
'when the Liver suffers restlessness, use sweetness to mod-
erate it' -this is used to moderate the Liver qi." 
Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica says that it 
"governs head wind, headache, dizziness and vertigo, epi-
lepsy with strong convulsions, spasms in the four limbs, 
difficulty in speech, and all wind-stroke and wind-phlegm." 
Li Gao observes: 
When the Liver is deficient, use Gastrodiae Rhizoma (tiiin 
md) and Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chuiin xiong) to tonify it. 
The functions of Gastrodiae Rhizoma (tiiin md) are four: 
it remedies wind-heat headaches in adults, wind-seizures, 
palpitations with anxiety in children, all wind tingling, 
painful obstruction, and numbness, and wind-heat affect-
ing speech. 
The Grand Materia Medica says that it 
is a herb of the Liver channel qi level. Basic Questions says: 
'All wind and dizziness belongs to wood', and therefore, 
because Gastrodiae Rhizoma (tiiin md) enters the leg ter-
minal yin channel, it can treat all [these types of] disorders. 
According to Luo Tian-Yi [a student ofLi Gao]: 'Darkening 
of the vision with dizziness is due to the internal activity of 
deficiency wind-without Gastrodiae Rhizoma (tiiin md) it 
cannot be treated'. 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica notes an 
internal contradiction in the traditional presentation of 
the attributes of Gastrodiae Rhizoma (tiiin md): on the one 
hand, it was originally described as acrid and warm, and 
thus 
drives out wind, overcomes dampness, and warms to 
unblock movement in areas of painful obstruction. Yet all 
the commentators also say that it governs wind from defi-
ciency headaches and dizziness, so that it calms the Liver 
and extinguishes wind, which is quite opposite to the meth-
od of expelling wind and unblocking painful obstruction. 
The book's author, Zhang Shan-Lei, goes on to say that if 
it is indeed acrid and warm, would this not aggravate the 
internal wind symptoms? 
And yet Luo Tian-Yi says that darkening of the vision with 
dizziness cannot be treated without Gastrodiae Rhizoma 
(tiiin md). From this we know that patterns such as painful 
obstruction or paralysis due to wind, cold, or damp patho-
gens cannot be effectively treated with Gastrodiae Rhizoma 
(tiiin md). For the texture of Gastrodiae Rhizoma (tiiin md) 
is heavy, thick, and solid, transparent, glossy and moist, 
rich in oils, and therefore it is calm and quiescent, sedating 
and settling, nourishing the yin fluids in order to extinguish 
internal wind; hence the [alternate] name settle wind herb 
(>tlitlit dlngfeng cao). 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
:l> WITH UNCARIAE RAMULUS CUM UNCIS (gou teng) 
The combination of these two herbs mutually enhances 
the ability of each to calm the Liver and extinguish wind, 
Gastrodiae Rhizoma (tiiin md) through its harmonious 
moistening moderation of the Liver qi, Uncariae Ramulus 
cum Uncis (gou teng) through its draining of Liver fire and 
wind. 
Comparisons 
:l> Vs. UNCARIAE RAMULUS CUM UNCIS (gou teng) 


974 
16 I Substances that Extinguish Wind and Stop Tremors 
Both herbs calm the Liver and extinguish internal wind, 
and are often combined. However, Gastrodiae Rhizoma 
(tiiin ma) is sweet, neutral, enriching and moistening, 
with a nature that moderates restlessness, while Uncariae 
Ramulus cum Uncis (gou teng) is bitter and cold, tending to 
cool the Liver in order to extinguish wind, and is thus used 
more for Liver heat inciting wind and leading to spasms 
and convulsions, and also for headaches and dizziness due 
to ascendant Liver yang. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"It definitely should not be used lightly in those with qi and 
blood deficiency." (New Compilation of Materia Medica) 
"Whenever patients feel a lack of saliva with dry tongue 
and mouth, dry sore throat, constipation with dry stools, 
blazing fire causing dizziness, blood deficiency headaches 
without pathogenic wind-it should not be used." (Harm 
and Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
Gastrodiae Rhizoma has a very low toxicity, and within 
the normal dosage range no side effects are to be expected. 
No drug dependence or tolerance has been observed. 
Administration of a very high dosage (80g within three 
hours) reportedly caused poisoning with such symptoms 
as flushing and hot sensation of the face, general weakness, 
headache, dizzness, visual disturbances, loss of muscle 
coordination, followed by loss of consciousness. There are 
very rare reports of allergic reactions including urticaria, 
purpura, vertigo, acute renal failure, and anaphylactic 
shock. In some patients, local transient pains have occured 
following injection of the herb. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "heavenly hemp" 
The source plant of gastrodia has a yellowish red stalk that 
is straight and round, very much like an arrow shaft, hence 
the name crimson arrow (<IF~ chljiim). Because the herb 
extinguishes wind, it is also called settle wind herb (Jtlil:!f 
ding feng cao). Good quality has a texture that is firm and 
semi-transparent, hence the name transparent gastrodia 
(B~ :k.JML ming tiiin ma). This is most obvious when thinly 
Sliced, Where it iS Called Sliced gastrodia ( :k_,Lf,tL J:l fiiin ma 
pian).
