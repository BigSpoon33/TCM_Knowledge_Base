pain is felt", after which the powdered herb is applied and 
the area bandaged and left overnight. The expected result is 
a drawing out of the root of the sore, as noted above. 
Comparisons 
)>- Vs. AILANTHI CoRTEX (chun pi) 
Both herbs bind the Intestines to treat diarrhea and dysen-
teric disorders, stop bleeding, and kill parasites. However, 
Granati Pericarpium (shi liu pi) is sour, astringent, and 
warm, specifically restraining and inhibiting in nature, with 
a strong binding action that is best applied to diarrhea and 
dysenteric disorders, incessant uterine bleeding, and vagi-
nal discharge associated with cold from deficiency. 
Ailanthi Cortex (chun pi) is bitter, astringent, and cold 
in nature, so that it clears heat and dries dampness; but 
its binding and stabilizing action is weaker than Granati 
Pericarpium (shi liu pi), making it more ap propriate for 
dysenteric disorders, vaginal discharge, or incessant uter-
ine bleeding due to heat or damp-heat. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"It can cling to the diaphragm and form phlegm. Taken 
too early in dysenteric disorders, it will be harmful." 
(Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
Granati Pericarpium (shi liu pi) is slightly toxic, due its 
alkaloid content. The toxicity of the isolated alkaloid 
complex is 25 times higher than the toxicity of the herb. 
Within the normal dosage range the following side effects 
have been reported: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdomi-
nal pain. Overdosage may cause mild toxic reactions such 
as vertigo, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, weakness, 
spasms of the shanks, tremor, and formication. 
The following toxic effects have been reported after 
ingestion of high doses: dilated pupils, diminished vision, 
intense headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, stronger pa-
tellar reflex, general weakness of the muscles, convulsions, 
and, in severe cases, death due to respiratory paralysis. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
The peel of the sour, not-quite-ripe fruit is traditionally 
considered best for medicinal purposes, and thus the fruit 
is collected just before they have completely ripened. After 
the fruit is harvested, it is opened, the seeds and inner 
membrane are removed, and the peel is retained. It is then 
cleaned of extraneous material, sliced into several sections, 
and dried in the sun. The peel of larger fruit is preferred. 
Originally, it was called peaceful pomegranate ( -'1{-;6 ~ 
iin shi liu), as it was brought to China in the second century 
by the ambassador to An Guo (-'1{- ~ iin guo-the peace-
ful country). This was the Chinese name for the ancient 
Central Asian country of Bokhara. 
)>- CHARRED POMEGRANATE HUSKS 
(;t;~lt& shiliupitim) 
The cleaned husks are dry-fried or baked at a high tem-
perature until blackish brown, then sprayed with water to 
extinguish the remaining embers. Any residual ashes are 
then sifted out. This method of preparation enhances the 
restraining, binding qualities of the herb, and is thus often 
called for in the treatment of chronic diarrhea, dysenteric 
disorders, or incessant uterine bleeding. In Convenient 
Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing-Cheng says that it 
"must be charred black to use."

PHARMACEUTICAL NAME: GRANAT! RADICIS CORTEX 
The root bark of the pomegranate has properties that are 
similar to the husk of the fruit. It is more frequently used 
for killing parasites, especially tapeworms and round-
worms, with a dosage ofl.5-9g. Note that it can be irritating 
to the digestive tract.

Commentary 
Bitter, astringent, and cold, Ailanthi Cortex (chun pi) 
enters both the qi and blood levels of the Stomach and 
Large Intestine channels where it clears heat, dries damp-
ness, cools the blood, and restrains bleeding. Thus it has 
many beneficial actions, limited only by its narrow channel 
affiliations. It is frequently used for vaginal discharge due 
to damp-heat, or vaginal discharge appearing mixed with 
blood, incessant uterine bleeding due to heat in the blood, 
and blood in the stool due to damp-heat in the Intestines. 
As early as the eighth century, the Materia Medica of Diet 
Therapy noted its effectiveness for dysenteric disorders 
and roundworms, and the Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi 
mentioned that it "halts diarrhea, Intestinal wind, and can 
contain urination." It is used externally as well, as a wash 
for scabies and damp sores, as it dries dampness and cools 
heat. 
Some writers, however, include the Lung channel among 
its affiliations. Zhu Zhen-Heng (also known as Zhu Dan-
Xi), after listing its usual indications, adds this interesting 
note: "expels long-term accumulated phlegm in the Lungs 
and Stomach." In this he is supported by Chen Shi-Duo, 
who wrote in New Edition of the Materia Medica that it 
"expels phlegm-fire of the Lungs and Stomach." 
As is true of all binding herbs, this should not be used 
when the pathogenic influence remains strong, but only 
after it has been substantially reduced, or completely elimi-
nated. In Penetrating the Mysteries of the Materia Medica, Li 
Zhong-Zi elaborates: 
The use of Ailanthi Cortex (chun pi) is specifically in its 
stabilizing containment. This is why it governs disorders 
both intestinal-such as diarrhea, Intestinal wind, and 
dysenteric disorders-and gynecological- such as enuresis, 
uterine bleeding, and turbid vaginal discharge. However, 
it is only appropriate when long-term illness has led to 
leakage. If taken too early in a new illness, trying to force a 
binding stability will certainly cause it to change into other 
symptoms and lead to a stubborn affliction. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
~ WITH GINSENG RADIX (ren shen) 
As noted above in the passage from Penetrating the Myster-


876 
13 I Herbs that Stabilize and Bind 
ies of the Materia Medica, Ailanthi Cortex ( chun pi) is used 
for stabilizing and restraining such disorders as diarrhea, 
enuresis, uterine bleeding, and turbid vaginal discharge, 
when long-term illness has led to leakage. Binding restraint 
is an appropriate method for treating leaking abandon-
ment disorders, but because the root of the condition is 
deficiency, tonification should also be used. 
In this combination, Ginseng Radix (ren shen) toni-
fies the qi to treat the root, while the binding, astringent 
Ailanthi Cortex (chun pi) is used to stop the loss and 
thereby treat the branch or manifestation. In Medical 
Formulas Collected and Analyzed, Wang Ang combines 
these two herbs, powdered, in a formula called Ginseng 
and Ailanthus Powder (ren shen chu pi san). The powder is 
taken with rice porridge, and treats both bleeding hemor-
rhoids and chronic dysenteric disorder with bleeding and 
pus. Wang Ang explains: 
The sweetness of Ginseng Radix (nfn shen) tonifies the qi, 
the bitterness of Ailanthi Cortex (chun pf) dries the damp-
ness, its coldness cools the heat, and its astringency inhibits 
loss. This tonifies deficient patients, and lifts that which has 
descended. 
Nowadays, beyond the conditions mentioned above, this 
combination can also be used to treat such disorders as 
chronic diarrhea or chronic watery vaginal discharge that 
incessantly leaks. Because the Ginseng Radix (ren shen) 
enhances activity of the normal qi to expel pathogens, and 
Ailanthi Cortex ( chun pi) is bitter and cold, the combination 
also has a moderate ability to eliminate damp-heat, above 
and beyond its usual stabilizing and binding actions. 
Comparisons 
~ Vs. PHELLODENDRI CoRTEX (huang bdi) 
Both herbs clear heat, dry dampness, and treat damp-heat 
vaginal discharge, for which they are often combined. 
However, Ailanthi Cortex (chun pi) restricts, binds, and 
cools the blood, and is thus also used for incessant uterine 
bleeding or blood in the stool due to heat in the blood, 
as well as for chronic dysenteric disorders. By contrast, 
Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) is very bitter and cold, 
with strong cooling and drying properties and a very wide 
range of application, from damp-heat jaundice to disorders 
of ministerial fire in the Kidney channel. 
Traditional Contraindications 
It cannot be used if there is cold from deficiency in the 
Spleen and Stomach, and it is also forbidden if vaginal 
discharge is due to true yin deficiency in Kidney patients, 
because it is drying. It should also not be used if the accu-
mulated pathogenic qi causing the vaginal discharge has 
not yet been completely eliminated. (Commentary on the 
Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
Overdosage can lead to nausea and vomiting. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
The plant used here is also known in English as the tree of 
heaven or Chinese sumac. Its foliage has an intensely dis-
agreeable odor, which is reflected in its Chinese botanical 
name, stinking ailanthus ( '-·-Mf chou chun). 
Both the dried bark and the inner root bark are used 
medicinally. The bark can be stripped at any time from the 
tree, and simply dried in the sun. This is called ailanthus 
bark (f{f;t chun pi or -Mf*-lt chu mil pi). When the dried 
bark is sliced into thin sections to facilitate decocting, it is 
called ailanthus bark threads (-Mflt!.!~ chun pi si). 
~ AILANTHUS WHITE BARK (f{f S Jt chun bai pi) or 
AILANTHUS RooT WHITE BARK 
(-Mf~R. s ;t chun gen bai pi) 
The root bark requires that the tree be felled and the roots 
unearthed. After washing, the rough blackish outer bark 
is removed by lightly striking the root with an axe handle 
or stick to loosen it, then scraping it off. The inner root 
bark is then dried in the sun, with the inner aspect of the 
bark facing outward, as the water content is concentrated 
toward the center. If the bark is not thoroughly dried it will 
deteriorate and turn a blackish color. Alternate names for 
the dried inner root bark include ~ s ;t chu bai pi and -Mf 
~~;t chun gen pi. 
~ DRY-FRIED AILANTHUS BARK (:k'J-MfJt chao chun pi) 
Sections of thin slices of the bark or root bark are dry-fried 
until deep yellow and slightly scorched. In some places 
bran is used as a medium for frying, first heating the bran 
until it begins to smoke, then adding the bark and cooking 
until scorched yellow. This method of preparation reduces 
the herb's bitter, cold properties and thus protects the 
digestion, especially if dry-fried in bran. 
~ VINEGAR-PREPARED AILANTHUS BARK 
(~:.k}f{f;t cu chao chun pi) 
Sections of the inner bark or inner root bark are soaked 
in vinegar for several hours, then dry-fried until dry and 
slightly scorched. Penetrating the Mysteries of the Materia 
Medica notes that "Whenever it is to be used, the rough 
outer bark must be scraped off. Used raw, it unblocks and 
facilitates; prepared with sour vinegar, it stabilizes and 
binds." 
Over time there has been some confusion as to the 
identity of the plant which provides this herb. The word -Mf 
chun can apply to either the standard plant for this herb,
