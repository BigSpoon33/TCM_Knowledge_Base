## 📖 Overview

WITH AGrIMONIAE HERBA (xian he cao 仙鹤草) AND ASINI CORII COLLA (e
jiao 阿胶)
Both herbs stop bleeding, but Agrimoniae Herba (xian
he cao) (see also regulates and tonifies the qi and blood
CoMMENTARY above), while Asini Corii Colla (e jiao) nour
ishes the blood and yin fluids. The combination therefore
has both a strong effect in stopping bleeding, and also a cer
tain supplementing effect. It is widely used for many types
of bleeding disorders such as coughing of blood, Intestinal
wind with blood in the stool, blood in the urine due to yin
deficiency, bleeding during pregnancy, and continuous
uterine bleeding. It is most appropriate when bleeding is
found with indications of yin and blood deficiency.
