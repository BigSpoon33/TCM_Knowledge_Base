## 📖 Overview

Aromatic and warm, *Foeniculi Fructus* (*xiǎo huí xiāng*) is excellent in small doses to adjust the qi of the middle burner and dispel lower burner cold. It enters the Spleen and Stomach to enhance the appetite, settle nausea, and alleviate abdominal pain and distention; it also enters the Liver and Kidney channels to warm the lower burner and treat all types of bulging disorders. It is frequently used in gynecology for cold-type dysmenorrhea, premenstrual abdominal distention and pain, and explosive diarrhea associated with menstruation. Due to its rather strong qi moving action, small doses (3-5g) are most comfortable for the patient; if dry-fried or salt-fried, a slightly larger dose (6-9g) is acceptable. Materia Medica of the Kaibao Era states that it "governs cold qi between the Bladder and the Kidneys, and the qi of the appendix, it adjusts the middle, alleviates pain, and stops nausea and vomiting." Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi says that it "treats both dry and wet leg qi, Kidney consumption, bulging qi, opens the Stomach, and drives the qi downward."

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica elaborates:

"All of these effects [are the result of its] acrid warmth promoting qi movement to disperse cold; it is excellent for treating all bulging disorders. However, its nature is really violently drying, exhausting the qi and injuring the yang fluids, it can only be used to guide into [its associated] channels, it cannot be used by itself or in large doses."
