Traditional Contraindications 
Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica 
notes that, although it has been claimed that this herb 
treats all types of deep-set swellings, "it is contraindicated 
for slow-growing swellings that have not come to a head, 
and that are not red and highly swollen. This is because its 
nature is cold, and it is not beneficial to yin-type sores."

Commentary 
Bitter, acrid, and slightly cold, Chrysanthemi indici Flos 
(ye ju huii) enters the Lung and Liver channels to drain fire, 
disperse wind, clear heat, resolve toxicity, and reduce swell-
ing. Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica observes: 
This is an herb for external medicine's swollen sores. Its 
flavor is acrid and also bitter, with a great ability to dis-
perse fire and disperse qi. Thus, any condition such as 
toxic sores, swollen abscess, scrofula, hot painful eyes, or 
stagnant blood in women will never lack this in its treat-
ment, because acridity can disperse qi, bitterness can dis-
perse fire .... However, those with deficient Stomach qi 
cannot take it recklessly. 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica elaborates: 
In addition to the other types of chrysanthemum, Chrysan-
themi indici Flos (ye ju huii) grows in most places, the flow-
ers and leaves of which are little, the stamens small and 
bean-like. The color is definitely yellow, and its actions are 
fierce and violent, with a particularly bitter flavor; its leaves 
are slender and tough. It can be used in external medicine 
as a topical application.
