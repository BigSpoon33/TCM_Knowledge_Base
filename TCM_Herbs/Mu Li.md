## 📖 Overview

Cold and heavy, Ostreae Concha (mǔ lì) enters the Liver and Kidney channels to cool heat, augment the yin, subdue the yang, and suppress fright.

*Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica* states that "Ostreae Concha (mǔ lì) enters the leg lesser yin and softens areas of hardness ... a medicinal of the Kidney channel blood level."

Ostreae Concha (mǔ lì) is salty and astringent in flavor, which enables it to soften areas of hardness and disperse clumping, while also restraining and stabilizing. Hence it treats steaming bones and flushing heat with excessive sweating, yin deficiency unable to control the yang, leading to headaches and dizziness, fright mania and restlessness, palpitations and insomnia, as well as spermatorrhea, vaginal discharge, continuous uterine bleeding, scrofula, phlegm nodules, and enlargement of the spleen or liver.

*Essentials of the Materia Medica* explains that Ostreae Concha (mǔ lì) is salty, [enabling it] to soften areas of hardness and transform phlegm, reduce scrofula, clumping, nodes, old blood, bulging qi, and mobile abdominal masses. It is astringent, [enabling it] to restrain abandonment, treating spermatorrhea, continuous uterine bleeding, and vaginal discharge, stopping coughs, inhibiting sweating, stabilizing the Large and Small Intestines. It is slightly cold, [enabling it] to cool heat, tonify water, and treat deficiency consumption with irritable heat.

Thus, although Ostreae Concha (mǔ lì) has an extremely wide scope of action, it can be summarized as follows: patterns of deficiency leading to leakage and loss; masses or nodules due to constrained heat and phlegm; and yin deficiency with floating yang leading to disorders in the channels of the Heart, Liver, and Kidneys.
