## 📖 Overview

Very bitter and very cold, with a descending nature, Sophorae Flavescentis Radix (ku shen) expels wind, stops itching, and promotes urination. It is particularly indicated for lower burner damp-heat, and damp-heat itching of the skin, but it also treats hot dysenteric disorder, for which it is a major constituent in several traditional formulas. Its ability to promote urination is used primarily when accumulated damp-heat clumps and disrupts the qi separation function of the Bladder; in such cases it leads the damp heat pathogen downward and out of the body through the urine. This is also a very effective strategy for clearing local dampness in cases of vaginal discharge.

Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica elaborates:

"Sophorae Flavescentis Radix (ku shen) expels wind and drains fire, dries dampness, and expels parasites. Earlier writers claimed that it tonifies the Kidneys and tonifies the yin, but this theory is grossly mistaken."

Zhang Shan-Lei, however, explained the basis for attributing tonifying qualities to Sophorae Flavescentis Radix (ku shen):

When they said that it 'tonifies the middle, nourishes the Liver and Gallbladder qi, calms the five yin organs, settles the mind, augments essence, facilitates the nine orifices, expels lurking heat, pacifies the Stomach qi, makes people desire food' and similar actions, all are due to damp-heat, which, once cleared, allows the normal qi to flourish!

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in cases of cold from deficiency of the Spleen or Stomach. It should not be combined with Veratri nigri Radix et Rhizoma (li lu). See Toxicity below.

cautions: Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica

"All herbs which are very bitter and very cold are inevitably very drying in nature, and excessive use cannot but injure the Spleen or deplete the Kidneys." It notes that Shen Cun-Zhong recorded that he had used Sophorae Flavescentis Radix for many years as a toothpaste (ku shen) for his dental problems, but soon suffered from disabling lower backache. His friend also used Sophorae Flavescentis Radix (ku shen) in the same way, and likewise suffered from backache. Both gave up this practice, and their backaches thereupon ceased. "This, then, is a clear sign that Sophorae Flavescentis Radix (ku shen) damages the Kidneys!" Zhu Dan-Xi, however, rejected this conclusion: "If the lower back feels heavy when using Sophorae Flavescentis Radix (ku shen), this is because its qi directs downward and does not raise, not because it injures the Kidneys!"
