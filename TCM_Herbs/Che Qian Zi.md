## 📖 Overview

Plantaginis Semen (che qian zi) is sweet, bland, cold, and slippery, enabling it to facilitate and leach out dampness, clear heat, and guide damp-heat downward and out through the urine. It has a wider scope of action than many other herbs which promote urination. It facilitates the Small Intestine's separation of the clear from the turbid, and unblocks painful urinary dribbling; it enters the Lung channel where it clears Lung heat and transforms turbid phlegm; it enters the Liver channel where it clears Liver heat in order to treat eye disorders. Thus it can be used for painful urinary dribbling and oliguria, summerheat dampness leading to diarrhea, cough due to Lung heat, red, burning eyes due to Liver heat, and damp-heat causing painful obstruction disorder.

Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica explains that the herb mobilizes the Liver and dredges the Kidneys, frees constraint and harmonizes the yang. When used together with Kidney tonifying herbs, it strengthens the yin to enhance fertility; used together with herbs that harmonize the Liver, it treats red eyes and blurry vision; if combined with cooling herbs, it alleviates dysenteric disorders due to fire from constraint, and if combined with herbs that ease the sinews, it can facilitate dampness and mobilize the qi, improving transportation to the feet and knees.

Other texts, however, question the statement that Plantaginis Semen (che qian zi) tonifies the Kidneys, saying that its main benefit to the Kidneys is through the removal of pathogenic dampness, and that this is the reason for its inclusion in so many formulas that tonify the Kidneys, rather than its own tonifying action.

Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica, echoing Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica, describes the effect of this herb on fertility:

In the nether regions of men and women there are two orifices, one orifice passes essence [the seminal orifice], which is the fire of the true yang at the gate of vitality; one orifice passes water [the urinary orifice], which is the water of dampness and heat in the Bladder. These two orifices do not open at the same time: when the water orifice opens, dampness and heat drain out [which can no longer disturb the ministerial fire], so the ministerial fire maintains a state of tranquility. The essence orifice remains closed, as a rule-after a long time when the essence is sufficient, the eyes will be bright. Consume herbs to secure the essence and take this herb for an extended time to enhance fertility.

This passage points out the complementary use of this herb with those that secure the essence. Opening the urinary orifice in this context does two things. First, it helps close the seminal orifice through its reciprocal relationship with the urinary orifice. In addition, it removes a potential source of disturbance to the essence, which by nature favors quiet accumulation and is averse to disruption by pathogens such as heat and dampness.
