## 📖 Overview

Sweet, sour, and neutral, the special characteristic of *Ziziphi spinosae Semen* (*suan zao ren*) is its ability to tonify the interior while inhibiting the exterior: it tonifies the nutritive blood to quiet the spirit and resolve, while simultaneously inhibiting the nutritive yin in order to stop sweating. In Renewed Materia Medica, Ye Gui says that it

calms the Liver to regulate the qi, moistens the Liver to nourish the yin, warms the middle to facilitate dampness, restrains qi to stop sweating, strengthens the resolve to settle angry outbursts, enhances the hearing and brightens the eyes.

It is an essential ingredient for prescriptions treating Heart and Liver blood deficiency depriving the spirit nourishment, and chaotic movement of fire from deficiency, which forces the nutritive yin to drain outward as sweat, with such symptoms as restless insomnia, palpitations, timidity, dream-disturbed sleep, being flustered and anxious, and sweating. Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians says that it "governs Heart irritability with inability to sleep." Zhu Zhen-Heng observes that

When blood does not return to the Spleen and causes restless sleep, [*Ziziphi spinosae Semen* (*suan zao ren*)] should be used to amply tonify the Heart and Spleen, after which the blood will return to the Spleen, the five yin organs will be peaceful and harmonious, and sleep will become tranquil.

Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica describes the wide application of its sour, restraining properties:

[It] tonifies all five yin organs: for example, [it can be used for] insufficiency of Heart qi with palpitations and failure to contain the consciousness; for insufficient closure of the pores and interstices with spontaneous sweating and nightsweats; for insufficiency of Lung qi with shortness of breath and trepidation, and dry cough without phlegm; for insufficiency of Liver qi with contracture and spasms of the sinews and bones, and dry, splitting nails; for insufficiency of Kidney qi with spermatorrhea, nocturnal emissions, and dribbling urine; for insufficiency of Spleen qi with clumped gathering of hot and cold, and emaciation of the muscles and flesh; for insufficiency of Gallbladder qi with trembling palpitations, fear, and restlessness from deficiency and inability to sleep. All of these cases are disorders of loss in the five yin organs-when they receive the sour, sweet warmth of *Ziziphi spinosae Semen* (*suan zao ren*), it quiets and calms the qi and blood, restraining so as to allow circulation.
