## 📖 Overview

The bitter nature of Peucedani Radix (qian hu) facilitates the downward direction of qi, while its acrid flavor helps it spread and disseminate. Thus, while it drains Lung heat by eliminating phlegm and directing qi downward, it also expels externally-contracted pathogens by assisting in the spreading of the Lung qi. It is therefore most appropriate in treating the cough, headache, and constrained Lung heat that results from externally-contracted pathogenic wind-heat, or the cough and wheezing with thick sputum that results from Lung qi failing to properly descend. When these two co-exist—thick phlegm and externally contracted heat—Peucedani Radix (qian hu) is especially indicated. Many texts warn, however, that it should not be used for externally-contracted disorders in the absence of phlegm accumulation.

The *Grand Materia Medica* observes: "The merit of Peucedani Radix (qian hu) lies primarily in directing qi downward, for when qi descends then fire will descend, and phlegm will also descend. Peucedani Radix (qian hu) can be credited with driving out the old to bring forth the new, and is a valued herb for the treatment of qi and phlegm."

The expression "driving out the old to bring forth the new" in descriptions of this herb appears in many textbooks of materia medica. It refers to the restoration of normal qi that results when obstructing phlegm is eliminated. There is also a somewhat greater emphasis in the ancient literature, compared to more recent textbooks, on its ability to disperse epigastric clumped qi and enhance digestive function, for example, in the treatment of childhood nutritional impairment. Several works also mention that it enters the Liver and Gall Bladder; *Essentials of the Materia Medica* goes so far as to say that "Wind-phlegm in the Liver and Gall Bladder channels cannot be expelled without [the use of] Peucedani Radix (qian hu)."
