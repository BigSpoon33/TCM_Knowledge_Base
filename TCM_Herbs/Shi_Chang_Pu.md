Commentary 
Although Acori tatarinowii Rhizoma (shi chang pu) is acrid 
and warm, its warmth is gentle and harmonious, and it 
dredges, disperses, opens, and spreads out due to its fra-
grant aroma. Entering the middle burner, it disseminates 
and transforms turbid dampness, awakens the Spleen and 
Stomach, and promotes digestion. Entering the chest and 
diaphragm, it dredges and dislodges congealed turbid 
phlegm, raises the clear yang, stimulates the consciousness, 
and unblocks the sensory orifices to improve hearing. 
It is considered essential in the treatment of coma, 
withdrawal-mania, or impaired mental function when 
these are associated with phlegm-dampness veiling the 
consciousness, preventing the clear yang from ascending; 
and for deafness, blunted affect, or forgetfulness when due 
to the same causes. 
Its warming action is quite mild, and may not be suf-
ficient if pathogenic cold is prominent in combination with 
dampness. Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica 
explains: 
Although Acori tatarinowii Rhizoma (shf chang pu) is 
warming, and this is sufficient in terms of clearing away the 
noxious, it will not suffice to warm the middle. This is not 
the herb to undertake major responsibility in cases of direct 
attack into the three yin [channels) with such symptoms 
as severe pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and [the consequent] 
cramping and cold sweats, hidden pulse, and cyanosis. 
jottings from Repeated Celebration Hall notes that it 
soothes the Heart qi, eases the spirit, delights the emotions, 
and augments the mind-a marvelous herb! Used with 
medicinals that clear and resolve, it can be depended upon 
to expel turbid phlegm-filth and protect the palace [of the 
Heart); used with medicinals that enrich and nourish, it can 
be adopted to disseminate clumping in the Heart due to 
excessive thinking, and to unblock the consciousness. 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica expands on 
this, explaining that 
In cases where phlegm stops, thin mucus accumulates, or 
turbid dampness veils, or in painful obstruction of the chest 
due to qi stagnation, with a tongue coating that is white and 
greasy with foul filth, or yellow and thick, only the fragrant 
aroma of Acori tatarinowii Rhizoma (sh£ chang pu) will 
unblock the orifices and restore free passage [of qi]. 
The ability of Acori tatarinowii Rhizoma (shi chang pu) 
to enhance digestion is also notable. Thoroughly Revised 
Materia Medica says that it: "Drives out phlegm, reduces 
accumulation, unbinds the Stomach and eases the middle. 
It remedies dysenteric disorders where the patient is unable 
to eat or drink." 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
>- WITH CuRcuMA£ RADIX (yu jfn) 
In this combination the acrid, warm, and aromatic Acori 
tatarinowii Rhizoma (shi chang pu) governs by virtue of 
its ability to expel phlegm, clear the spirit, and open the 
orifices. It is assisted by the acrid, bitter, cooling Curcumae 
Radix (yu jfn), which clears the Heart, relieves constraint, 
and promotes movement of qi and blood. This combination 
has a very useful quality of utilizing its intense fragrances to 
transform dampness, open the orifices, and awaken the 
brain. Hence it is often used in treating warm damp febrile 
patterns when heat has entered the Pericardium, or where 
turbid dampness has enveloped the clear orifice of the 
spirit. In both cases the symptoms are loss of consciousness 
or confusion, tinnitus, and forgetfulness. Moreover, this 
combination can be used with other herbs whenever there 
is constraint-especially of qi, blood, or phlegm-lead-
ing to palpitations, forgetfulness, or moodiness, or even 
withdrawal-mania, hysteria, depression, or reduced mental 
acuity as a sequela of brain concussion.

Comparisons 
>- Vs. PoLYGALAE RADIX (yuan zhl) 
Acori tatarinowii Rhizoma (shi chang pu) is acrid and 
warm, relying on its fragrance to facilitate the opening of 
the orifices, disseminating the qi, and expelling phlegm in 
order to open the orifice of the Heart. By contrast, the bit-
ter warmth of Polygalae Radix (yuan zhl) expels phlegm, 
calms the spirit, and augments the mind. Thus, while both
