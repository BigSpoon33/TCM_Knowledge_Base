12 I Tonifying Herbs 
in cases of postpartum loss of appetite, or diarrhea, even 
though there may be fever, or pain due to retained lochia, it 
cannot be used-mistaken use will cause ceaseless diarrhea; 
whenever the diaphragm area has excessive phlegm and 
the movement of the qi dynamic is poor such that ascent 
and descent are plugged, herbs should unblock rather than 
cause stagnation, so in these cases, rehmannia is forbidden 
in decoctions or pills. If it absolutely must be used, then a 
bit of cinnamon heart [a form of Cinnamomi Cortex ( ri>u 
gul)] can be added. In a phlegm pattern, if it must be used 
and cannot be done without, then fry it with ginger juice. 
Toxicity 
There has been one report of an allergic skin reaction asso-
ciated with taking this herb. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "cooked earth yellow" 
Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di huang) is prepared by 
mixing Rehmanniae Radix (sheng dl huang) with rice wine 
and steaming until the roots are black and moist, inside and 
out. The herbs are then dried in the sun. 
::o> DRY-FRIED CooKED REHMANNIA 
(;ky~~.!l!:. ~ chao shu di huang) 
The sliced herb is dry-fried until scorch marks appear. This 
method of preparation slightly reduces the herb's cloying 
greasiness, and is used for patients with weak digestion, but 
the effects are otherwise similar to the unprepared herb. 
::o> CHARRED COOKED REHMANNIA 
(~~.!1/:. ~£shu di huang tim or ~Ml!:.£ shu di tim) 
The sliced herb is baked at a moderate to high temperature 
in a covered pan until a piece of white paper affixed to 
the top of the cover turns scorched black. Slices of other-
wise unprepared cooked rehmannia can also be directly 
dry-fried until chimed, but not deformed. Not only does 
charred cooked rehmannia still nourish the blood, its abil-
ity to stop bleeding is also enhanced. 
)> GINGER-PREPARED COOKED REHMANNIA 
( 1: ~ 
1~ .!6 ~ jitmg zhl shu dl huang) 
Slices of the herb are sprayed with a mixture of water and 
sliced raw ginger, then briefly dry-fried until the ginger 
juice has been absorbed. This was a common method of 
preparation in ancient times, but is now rarely used. The 
Orthodox Lineage of Medicine states that when prepared 
in his manner, the herb no longer has a cloying effect on 
the diaphragm and would thus be most appropriate for pa-
tients with phlegm-dampness in the area of the diaphragm. 
Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica observes: "In a 
phlegm pattern, if Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di 
huang) must be used and cannot be done without, then fry 
it with ginger juice." 
::o> CooKED REHMANNIA WITH AMOMUM FRUIT 
(&;)11::.1-f-~~ .!1/:. sha ren bim shu di) 
Powdered Amomi Fructus (sha ren) is mixed with this herb 
until its surface is covered with powder. This prevents the 
excessive greasiness of rehmannia from interfering with 
digestion. A common alternative is to simply add Amomi 
Fructus (sha ren) to prescriptions containing Rehmanniae 
Radix preparata (shu di huang).

Additional product information 
This herb is mostly cultivated, but sometimes the wild-crafted 
product (!I'H!\Jeir ye shu di huang) can be found. The pieces are 
smaller, mostly cut cylindrically, 3-5cm long, and only 1cm in diam-
eter. The taste is slightly bitter and less sweet than the cultivated 
product, but there is no difference in quality. 
The best quality is said to come from Wenxian, Boai, and 
Mengxian in Henan province.

Commentary 
Bitter, astringent, and slightly warm, Polygoni multifiori 
Radix preparata (zhl he shou wii) enters the Liver and 
Kidney channels. When prepared by stewing or steam-
ing, it becomes sweet and slightly warm, which enables it 
to augment the blood and yin of the Liver and Kidneys, 
strengthen the sinews and bones, and preserve the essence. 
Its nature is gently warm and harmonious, neither cold nor 
drying, nor is it excessively greasy or cloying. It is there-
fore appropriate for patients who otherwise cannot accept 
strong tonifying herbs. It is often used for Liver and Kidney 
deficiency leading to premature greying, weakness of the 
lower back and knees, spermatorrhea, uterine bleeding, or 
vaginal discharge. Because it nourishes the Liver blood, it 
is also useful in the treatment of dizziness or tinnitus due 
to Liver yin and blood deficiency, allowing the Liver yang 
to ascend. 
The Grand Materia Medica elaborates: 
This substance is warm, bitter, and astringent: its bitterness 
tonifies the Kidneys, its warmth tonifies the Liver, and its 
astringency restrains and inhibits the essential qi. Thus, it 
nourishes the blood to augment the Liver and secures the 
essence to augment the Kidneys, strengthens the sinews and 
bones, and blackens the beard and hair, making it a fine 
herb for enriching and tonifying! It is not cold or drying, 
and its effects are superior to those ofRehmanniae Radix 
(dl huang) or Asparagi Radix (tian men dong) [because of 
these attributes]. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
>- WITH TAXILLI HERBA (siingjl sheng) 
This combination has two major therapeutic applications: 
tonifying the Liver blood and Kidney yin to nourish the 
sinews and bones, and treating dizziness, blurred vision, 
and numbness of the extremities associated with Liver 
blood deficiency. Both herbs tonify the Liver and Kidney 
yin, and both treat weakness of the limbs. However, Poly-


748 
12 I Tonifying Herbs 
goni multiflori Radix preparata (he sh6u wu) more strongly 
tonifies the yin and blood, while Taxilli Herba (sang jl 
sheng) contributes more to expelling wind-dampness. 
Comparisons 
~ Vs. REHMANNIAE RADIX PREP ARATA (shu dz huang) 
Both herbs nourish the blood and enrich the yin, torrify the 
Liver and augment the Kidneys. However, Rehmanniae 
Radix preparata (shu dl huang) is black in color and so 
primarily enters the Kidneys to augment the essence and 
marrow, and strongly torrify the true yin, while secondarily 
torrifying the blood and nourishing the Liver. It is quite 
greasy and cloying, and thus difficult to digest. By contrast, 
Polygoni multiflori Radix preparata (he sh6u wu) is reddish 
brown in color, and so primarily enters the Liver to adjust 
and torrify the nutritive blood, while secondarily enriching 
the Kidney yin and securing the essence. While it does not 
have quite the torrifying strength of Rehmanniae Radix 
preparata (shu dl huang), neither is it as greasy or hard to 
digest. 
Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica states that, 
although both of these herbs torrify the yin, 
Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu dl huang) strongly toni-
ties the congenital true yin, and can achieve immediate 
results in dangerous situations such as violent ascent of 
orphaned yang. Polygoni multifiori Radix preparata (he 
sh6u wu), on the other hand, adjusts and tonifies the post-
natal nutritive blood, and can be taken over a long period 
of time to foster and nourish the essence-spirit, expel dis-
ease, and adjust the primal. The congenital yin and post-
natal yin are not alike, and the rapidity of effect [of these 
herbs on the two yin] is greatly different. 
Unprepared Rehmanniae Radix (sheng dl huang) cools the 
blood, while unprepared Polygoni multiflori Radix (sheng 
he sh6u wu) resolves toxicity, treats malarial disorder, and 
moistens the Intestines.

Traditional Contraindications 
This is a blood-augmenting substance; if taken together 
with antagonistic substances or turnips, it will make one's 
beard and hair turn prematurely white. It is forbidden to 
use together with drying, hot herbs such as Aconiti Radix 
lateralis preparata (zhl fo zf), Curculiginis Rhizoma (xian 
mdo), Zingiberis Rhizoma (ganjiang), and Cinnamomi 
Cortex ( rou gul). It is harmful if [consumed after] it con-
tacts metal. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
The following adverse effects have been reported: mild ab-
dominal pain, nausea, vomiting, reduced appetite, weakness, 
mild icterus, abnormal liver function studies, bleeding 
from the upper digestive tract, diarrhea, melena. Extremely 
high doses can cause stimulation, agitation, tachycardia, 
clonic or tetanic spasms, and even death due to respira-
tory paralysis. A repetitive, malarial-like sequence of drug 
fever, chills, sweating, and weakness has been observed. 
Other allergic reactions include systemic pruritus, diffuse 
epigastric pain, erythema, shortness of breath, agitation, 
and tachypnea. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "prepared crow-black-haired 
[Mr.] He" 
Regarding the name's origin, the Grand Materia Medica 
cites a ninth-century legend, recorded by the Tang dynasty 
natural philosopher Li Ao in The Story of He Shou-Wu (1"J 
it.~ 1l he sh6u wu zhuim), which describes the discovery 
of the plant by an older man named Mr. He, who was 
plagued by illness and infertility. This plant has many vines 
with numerous, intertwining tendrils. Mr. He observed the 
nocturnal commingling of the vines, which was the basis 
for one of its other nicknames, nocturnal commingling(~ 
x ye jiao). Inspired, he consumed it regularly for several 
years, regained his health and youthful complexion-as 
well as his black hair-and thereafter fathered children. 
Because this is a prepared herb, it is known as processed 
fleeceflower root (~ 10J it.~ zhl he sh6u wu, or ~it .~ zhl 
sh6u wii). In the literature, the term 1orit.~ he sh6u wu 
almost always refers to the prepared product, while 1..1"Jit 
.~ sheng he sh6u wu is specified when the unprepared herb 
is desired (see ADDENDUM below). The herb is prepared by 
mixing pieces of the cleaned, raw root with yellow rice wine 
and black bean (Glycine max) juice, made by boiling black 
soybeans for several hours. This mixture is then placed in 
a nonmetallic container and double-boiled (or steamed) 
until the liquid has been absorbed by the roots. 
This method of preparation alters the original nature 
of the herb, enabling it to torrify the Liver and Kidneys and 
nourish the essence and blood with warm, richly sweet, 
and slightly astringent properties that coincide with the 
lower burner functions of closing and preserving. Thus it 
augments and replenishes the essential qi with the effect of 
making the yin and yang more balanced and more dense. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of long, reddish brown, heavy, pow-
dery roots with a yellowish brown surface on cross section. 
The prepared herb is brownish black. Light, porous, and 
fibrous roots are considered to be of poor quality. Large 
roots that are the size and shape of a baby fetch a very high 
price.
