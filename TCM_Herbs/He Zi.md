## 📖 Overview

Because Chebulae Fructus (he zi) is bitter, it directs downward; because it is sour, it binds, restrains, and inhibits. The strength of its downward-directing action is greater than its restraining, inhibiting action. Used in its unprepared form, it enters the Lungs to restrain the Lung qi and thereby stop the cough and rebellious qi, while also driving the qi and fire downward to benefit the throat. Thus it is often used for cough and wheezing due to Lung qi deficiency, and for chronic cough and loss of voice. Baked, it enters the Intestines to bind the Intestines and stop diarrhea, and is often used for chronic diarrhea and dysenteric disorders.

Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica states that it:
> is bitter, astringent, directs downward, and restrains. Used unprepared, it clears metal and stops coughs, used [after] prepared by baking, it stabilizes the Spleen and stops diarrhea. Ancient formulas used its [draining] bitterness to transform phlegm and oral mucus, and its astringency to stabilize leaking and draining.

In Zhang Bing's Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Cheng says that it:
> has a strong, bitter, downward-directing action, but its sour, astringent nature is rather weak, thus it drives the Lung qi downward and expels accumulated phlegm-food in the chest and diaphragm. [Zhang] Zhong-Jing used it to treat qi dysenteric disorder, utilizing it to treat the qi; later generations only used it for inhibiting the Lungs and binding the Intestines, but forgot its dredging action to expel phlegm and drive the qi downward!

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica advises: "If there is cough due to phlegm with discomfort of the throat, hold several fruits [in the mouth] and swallow the juice; this is especially effective." This book also notes that for hemorrhoids and postpartum vaginal pain, the herb can be combined with vinegar and burned, so that it smokes the area as the patient squats over it. It adds that "It can also be decocted to steam and wash the area."

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in exterior patterns or in those with internal accumulation and stagnation of damp-heat.

Traditional Contraindications:
>"It cannot be casually used for qi deficiency and sudden cough, or in the early stages of diarrhea." (Introduction to Medicine)
"Deficient people should not use it by itself." (Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica)
"Its bitter, downward-directing nature should be avoided if the upper burner primal qi is deficient and sinking." (Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica)

Very few realize that although 'astringency secures abandonment', a downward-directing, inhibiting nature is not as good as the Spleen-augmenting power of sweetness and warmth [for treating deficiency]. For this reason [this herb] can only be used in those cases of long-term cough and wheezing in which the true qi has not yet been weakened, as [the herb] has a quite compelling ability to check [and restrain]. Furthermore [in such cases as]long-term cough due to fire from yin deficiency blazing upward [or]long term dysenteric disorders with a fire from deficiency that is forcing downward, the more one compels and checks, the more obstruction results. (Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica)

>In cases such as these, one must first eliminate the fire from deficiency by tonifying the yin, rather than attempting astringent restraint.
