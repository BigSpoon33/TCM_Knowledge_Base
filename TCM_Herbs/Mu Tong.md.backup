## 📖 Overview

Bitter and cold, the nature of Akebiae Caulis (*mu tong*) is to unblock, facilitate the removal of pathogenic water, clear, and direct downward. It clears fire from the Heart and Lungs in the upper body, guides out dampness from the Small Intestine and Bladder in the lower body, and drives damp-heat and pathogenic fire downward to drain out through the urine. Thus, it directs fire downward and promotes urination. It can be used in the treatment of rough painful urination, painful bloody urinary dribbling, ulcers of the mouth and tongue, irritability, red eyes, edema, and yellowish vaginal discharge and swelling due to internal congestion of damp-heat. Furthermore, it can promote the flow of qi and blood, unblocking lactation in the upper body, and treating amenorrhea due to blood stasis in the lower body. It also alleviates swelling and pain in the joints from obstruction of the collaterals throughout the body.
- *Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica* observes that this substance is light in weight, with tiny perforations passing through it, very bitter in flavor, and thus excels in draining and directing downward to dispel dampness; it is specific for treating collected clumping of damp-heat that is unable to move.
