14 I Substances that Calm the Spirit 
923 
According to Collection of Commentaries on the Classic of 
Materia Medica, this substance counteracts Aconiti Radix 
lateralis preparata (zhl fo zi). 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "purple stone radiance" 
In the Grand Materia Medica, Li Shi-Zhen notes that the 
term 'stone radiance' is used because, "resembling jade, it 
has a lustrous brilliance." Unprepared fluorite sedates the 
Heart and calms the spirit, but its qualities can be altered 
somewhat through the calcining process. 
)> CALCINED FLUORITE (:i:rf.1K ;b * ducm zi shi yfng) 
The mineral is placed inside a calcining container and heat-
ed until red hot throughout, then cooled by plunging it into 
vinegar. It must then be immediately removed from the 
vinegar and dried, lest the material turn white, adversely 
affecting its quality. This method of preparation facilitates 
pulverization, but also enhances its ability to warm the 
Lungs, direct rebellious qi downward, dispel cold, and 
warm the Womb. It is thus used in the treatment of Lung 
deficiency with cough due to cold, and cold in the Womb 
leading to infertility. This is the process recommended in 
the Grand Materia Medica. 
However, calcining fluorite has not been without its 
critics. Among many others, including the redoubtable 
Zhang Lu and Zhang Bing-Cheng, the eighteenth-cen-
tury writer Zhang Cheng stated that it "possesses warming, 
nourishing, and moistening actions, it cannot be refined 
in fire. If it is calcined in fire, it loses its moistening nature, 
and moreover becomes toxic!" 
Because this mineral is quite easily pulverized, there 
seems little benefit to be gained from the calcining process, 
and it is recommended that Fluoritum (zi shi yfng) be used 
in its unprepared state. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality is hard, transparent, and blue or purplish 
blue. 
Major known chemical constituents 
CaF2, traces of Fe20 3 , Y, Ce 
Adulterants 
Calcitum (::?M-A> fangjie sh[): In some areas of Qinghai, Guangxi, 
and Shanxi provinces, calcitum is used instead of fluoritum. The 
two minerals can easily be distinguished by placing one drop of 
acetic acid on its surface: the appearance of gas bubbles indi-
cates calcitum.

Commentary 
Succinum (hu po) is sweet and neutral, and enters the 
blood level of the Heart and Liver to suppress fright, quiet 
the spirit, unblock blood stasis, and promote urination. 
To suppress palpitations, fright, or tremors, and treat 
insomnia, it is usually combined with mineral or metallic 
medicinals that anchor, settle, and calm the spirit. When 
used to promote blood movement and break up blood 
stagnation, it is usually combined with warm, acrid herbs 
that encourage the movement of blood. For unblocking 
painful urinary dribbling, and to facilitate the urethral ori-
fice, it is usually combined with bland, leaching herbs that 
facilitate urination. 
In one of the earliest records of its therapeutic proper-
ties, the Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians states: 
"Primarily quiets the five yin organs, settles the ethereal 
soul and the corporeal soul, eliminates static blood, and 
unblocks the five painful urinary difficulties." 
The Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi notes: "Fortifies the 
Heart, brightens the eyes and eradicates superficial visual 
obstructions, stops Heart pain and pathogenic withdrawal, 
breaks up clumping and fixed abdominal masses." 
Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of 
Materia Medica explains that it 
specifically enters the blood level. The Heart governs the 
blood, the Liver stores the blood, it enters the Heart and 
Liver, so it can eliminate static blood . .. . In the final analy-
sis, however, Succinum (hii po) has a nature that reduces, 
eradicates, leaches and facilitates-it is not beneficial for 
deficient people. As a rule, it is used with acrid, warming 
herbs to promote the movement of blood and break up 
[stagnant] blood, with bland, leaching herbs to facilitate 
[the lower] orifice and promote the movement of water, 
and with metallic or mineral substances to sedate the Heart 
and quiet the spirit. 
Comparisons 
:> Vs. PORIA (fu ling) 
Both substances calm the spirit and facilitate urination. 
However, Succinum (hu po) enters the blood level with a 
tendency to drain, while Poria (fu ling) enters the qi level 
with a tendency to tonify. Both treat disorders of the spirit 
and resolve, but Poria (jU ling) is most appropriate when 
the Heart lacks nourishment, or pathogenic water disturbs 
the Heart, while Succinum (hu po) is most appropri-
ate when ascendant yang or overabundant fire disturbs 
the Heart. Succinum (hu po) transforms stagnation and 
unblocks the orifices, and is best when painful urinary drib-
bling is associated with obstruction of damp-heat or qi and 
blood stagnation in the Bladder, and the symptoms involve 
scanty, painful, and bloody urine. Poria (fu ling) augments 
the qi and leaches dampness, and is thus best for qi defi-
ciency failing to transform the fluids, leading to edema and 
scanty urine. 
Traditional Contraindications 
Bland and leaching, it injures the yin, so it should not be 
taken by those with yin deficiency internal heat, fire blaz-
ing, or water depletion. If the blood is deficient and urinat-
ing is difficult, consuming it will cause an adverse acute 
irritation. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Standards of production vary across the many places that 
produce amber, and thus the quality of the natural product 
also varies widely. Quality is measured by the degree of 
contamination due to infiltration by its matrix and soil, and 
the extent to which the product has been cleaned.
