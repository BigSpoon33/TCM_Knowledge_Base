## 📖 Overview

Sweet, salty, and cold, Margarita (zhen zhu) enters the Heart and Liver channels to clear heat from these two channels, and to calm the spirit, calm the Liver, and reduce superficial visual obstructions. It augments the yin and resolves toxicity and is used for palpitations, withdrawal-mania, childhood convulsions, and superficial visual obstructions with impaired vision, as well as for ulceration of the throat and gums. Applied topically, it restrains, inhibits, and generates flesh. The Materia Medica of the Kaibao Era says that it "sedates the Heart; applied as eyedrops it expels membranous superficial visual obstructions."

Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica explains that it enters the arm lesser yin Heart channel and leg terminal yin Liver channel. When the Heart has heat from deficiency, the spirit floats and strays; when the Liver has heat from deficiency, the eyes generate superficial visual obstructions. When the heat is expelled from theses two channels, the Heart is sedated and the vision is improved.

In Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing Cheng observes:

It is generated endowed with the essential qi of the greater yin [i.e., the moon, so it] clears heat, augments the yin, and resolves toxicity. Because it is sweet, bland, salty, and cold in nature, it sedates the Heart, settles fright, and can remedy mania. It treats childhood convulsions with phlegm confusion, enters the Liver to brighten the eyes, generate flesh, reduce superficial visual obstructions, and enhance the complexion .... Augmenting the yin and resolving toxicity are its intrinsic actions.

Materia Medica from the [Southern} Seaboard Area and other texts note that it can eliminate darkish discolorations on the face, such as chloasma, and improve the complexion. For this reason, Margarita (zhen zhu) is included in a number of topically applied facial creams and beauty preparations.
