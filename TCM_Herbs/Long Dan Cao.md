## 📖 Overview

Very bitter, very cold, and sinking in nature, Gentianae Radix (龙胆草, long dan cao) directs downward. Its two primary actions are cooling fire from excess in the Liver and Gallbladder, and clearing lower burner damp-heat. These attributes also make it suitable for symptoms of lower burner damp-heat, such as swelling or pain in the scrotum, genital pruritus, vaginal discharge, or painful urinary dribbling disorder with turbid, cloudy urine.

Gentianae Radix (龙胆草, long dan cao) is often used for symptoms associated with Liver and Gallbladder fire, such as headache with red eyes, deafness and tinnitus, costal pain, bitter taste, and childhood convulsions. As noted in *Harm and Benefit* in the *Materia Medica*: "Bupleuri Radix (柴胡, chai hu) as chief herb, and Gentianae Radix (龙胆草, long dan cao) as deputy: an essential remedy for eye disorders. However, if the eye disorder has just begun, the method should be to bring out and disperse; cool and cold are forbidden."

Li Gao noted that Gentianae Radix (龙胆草, long dan cao) "drives out pathogenic heat in the Liver channel, reduces swelling due to lower burner damp-heat, and drains Bladder fire." *Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances* states that it:

"...drains Liver and Gallbladder fire and primarily treats pain in the eyes and neck, ribs and costal area... Whenever the Liver channel suffers from pathogenic heat, the use of Gentianae Radix (龙胆草, long dan cao) is truly marvelous. Its flavor is intense, so it sinks downward, making it an excellent choice for clearing lower burner damp-heat symptoms such as sores on the scrotum, venereal sores, and urinary difficulty."

Even though it can eliminate heat from excess and drain the Liver and Gallbladder, still, if the Stomach is deficient or there is a lack of blood, it cannot be tried lightly. Whenever an illness involves deficiency of both the Spleen and Stomach, and the deficiency involves heat, it is forbidden to take Gentianae Radix (龙胆草, long dan cao). It should also not be taken on an empty stomach, otherwise it will cause incontinence of urine as its draining is too extreme."
