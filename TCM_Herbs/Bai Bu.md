## 📖 Overview

Although Stemonae Radix (bai bu) is slightly warming, because its sweetness moistens and its bitter flavor directs qi downward it can be used for any type of cough, old or new, hot or cold. It is especially indicated for chronic cough from deficiency.

In Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, the early twentieth-century writer Zhang Shan-Lei discussed the different views regarding the nature of this herb: Stemonae Radix (bai bu) excels at killing parasites. Parasites are generated from damp-heat, and even if the Lungs of tubercular patients contain [micro-]organisms, this is also heat from deficiency. Since Stemonae Radix (bai bu) is indicated for this, it seems that it cannot be termed warm in nature. Therefore, while Zhen Quan calls it sweet, the Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi calls it bitter, and the Illustrated Classic of the Materia Medica says that it is slightly cold. In his Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica, Miao [Xi-Yong] directly states that Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians was incorrect [in calling it 'slightly warm'].

Even if we do call it slightly warm, it is more similar to the warm moistness of Asteris Radix (zi wan), as an example of [an herb that] is indicated for Lung cough and is not 'warm' in the sense of 'hot', and therefore can be used for all cases of cough.

The root [that is this herb] is made up of many rootlets, sometimes up to ten in number, which tend to point downward, and thus treat up-rushing of qi—being moist and not drying, while also opening, draining, and directing qi downward, Stemonae Radix (bai bu) is appropriate for any type of cough, but is especially important for long-term cough and cough from deficiency.

Zhang goes on to point out that the proven efficacy of Stop Coughing Powder (zhi sou san) relies on the combination of Stemonae Radix (bai bu) and Asteris Radix (zi wan).

Mechanisms of Selected Combinations

WITH CYNANCHI STAUNTONII RHIZOMA (bai qian)

Both herbs enter the Lung channel and are specific for alleviating cough and transforming phlegm. Cynanchi stauntonii Rhizoma (bai qian) is acrid, bitter, and slightly warm, and is particularly effective for directing qi downward: "When qi descends, phlegm and thin mucus will disperse by themselves, and cough will naturally cease." Together with the sweetness of Stemonae Radix (bai bu), which moistens, and its bitterness, which drains, the two herbs assist and complement each other's actions, providing a strong phlegm-transforming effect that is not too parching, while pacifying the Lung qi. This combination can thus be used any time the Lungs are blocked up with profuse phlegm with symptoms of cough, fullness in the chest, and wheezing, irrespective of whether the condition is hot or cold, deficient or excessive.
