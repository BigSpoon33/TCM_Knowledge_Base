## 📖 Overview

Light in nature but not very good at releasing the exterior, (*xin yi*) Magnoliae Flos unblocks the nasal orifice through its ability to enter the Lung channel and expel pathogenic wind. By also entering the Stomach channel it can lead the clear yang qi in the Stomach upward to reach the head and brain and thereby stop headache. For wind-heat type nasal obstruction this herb should be combined with cooling herbs such as Scutellariae Radix (*huang qin*), Mori Folium (*sang ye*), and Menthae haplocalycis Herba (*bo he*).

*Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica* elaborates on the effects of this herb:

Specifically enters the Lungs. Acrid and warm with floating qi. Its effect is concentrated on entering the Lungs and releasing wind-heat. The reason for this is that a person's nasal breathing communicates with heaven and the Lungs open into the nose as their orifice. When wind-heat transfers into the brain, then the nose has profuse and continuous nasal mucus. Wind-cold resides in the brain and the nose becomes blocked. ... Also headache, chloasma, dizziness, toothache, and lack of facilitation in the nine orifices. All of these benefit from this aroma, which can rise and penetrate to the head and eyes.

*The Grand Materia Medica* observes:

Enters the arm greater yin and leg yang brightness channels .... The breath from the nose communicates with heaven. Heaven is the head and the Lungs. The Lungs open into the nose, and the yang brightness channel circles the nose and travels upward. The brain is the palace of the primal spirit and the nose is the orifice of the gate of vitality. When a person's middle qi is insufficient, clear yang cannot rise, and thus the head empties and the nine orifices are blocked. The acrid warmth of Magnoliae Flos (*xin yi*) mobilizes the qi and enters the Lungs; its structure is light and floating and can assist the clear yang of the Stomach rise up to mobilize and unblock heaven. This is why it can warm the middle and treat diseases of the head, eyes, and nasal orifices. Since the time of the *Inner Classic*, only Li [Gao] of Dong Yuan alone has been able to reach this understanding.

This is one of the essential herbs in the treatment of nasal and sinus conditions. In addition, most materia medica texts record that it can be used externally in a facial cream for chloasma.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in cases of fire from yin deficiency.

Its acrid, aromatic, piercing, and mobilizing nature makes it forbidden in qi-deficient patients with exposure to wind cold causing nasal congestion; those patients with headache from blood deficiency with accumulated fire or toothache from Stomach fire who take it will become worse. The hairy texture of the floral envelope can enter the Lungs and cause cough. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)

Chen Shi-Duo notes:
Acrid, dispersing substances, if used excessively, will injure the true qi: they can be used temporarily, but not for an extended period. In summary, once the illness is expelled then stop [using the herb]; do not be tempted to repeatedly apply it just because of its great efficacy. This caution is not limited to Magnoliae Flos (*xin yi*).
