5 I Herbs that Dispel Wind-Dampness 
eases the sinews, invigorates the blood, and treats all types 
of wind-dampness; it alleviates the swelling of hemor-
rhoids, headaches due to wind qi, unilateral headaches, 
wind affecting one limb [and thereby] restricting move-
ment, weak and aching pain in the feet preventing walk-
ing, and contraction of the arms so that they cannot be 
stretched or lifted. 
Comparisons 
>- Vs. SrEGESBECKIAE HERBA (xlxitm dio) 
Both herbs treat wind-damp painful obstruction and itchy 
rashes due to wind or dampness. However, Siegesbeckiae 
Herba (x1 xian ci:io) is best for dispelling wind-dampness 
within the sinews and bones, and also treats wind-stroke 
leading to paralysis, being especially good for numbness 
of the limbs. Clerodendri Folium (chou wu tong), on the 
other hand, is also able to calm the Liver yang, and thus 
treats dizziness. It is strong enough in this respect to be 
used alone. 
Toxicity 
Owing to its alkaloid content, this herb (and other species 
of the genus Clerodendrum) should be regarded as slightly 
toxic. Overdosage must be avoided. Extremely large dosage 
(250g of the fresh leaves concentrated into one cup of liq-
uid) have led to persistent vomiting and liquid diarrhea. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "stinky parasol tree" 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of green leaves with a fresh, aromatic 
fragrance and a bitter, astringent taste. 
Major known chemical constituents 
Flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides: clerodendrin A, clerodendrin B 
(acacetin-7 -di-B-glucuronide ), clerodendroside 
Other constituents: kusaginin, bitter substances 
Alternate species & local variants 
Clerodendron bungei (" ~± ft chOu mil dan) - N, NW, SW 
China. According to Omissions from the Grand Materia Medica, 
C/erodendron fragrans ( '-· )ft,tij chOu mo 17) was originally the main 
plant used for this herb.

Commentary 
Bitter and somewhat cold, Trachelospermi Caulis (luo 
shf teng) dispels wind-dampness, eases the sinews, and 
invigorates the collaterals; it also cools heat in the blood 
and reduces swollen sores. It is thus an excellent choice 
for treating the pain associated with wind-damp painful 
obstruction, cramping spasms of the sinews, and restricted 
movement of the joints. It mobilizes the channels and ves-
sels, spreads out to the joints, invigorates the collaterals, 
and cools the blood. Its use for sores due to heat toxin, and 
for trauma, was far more widespread in ancient times and 
is now rarely used for these indications. 
The Grand Materia Medica says of this herb: "Persistent 
by nature, harmonious and neutral in flavor and prop-
erty, its primary indications include sinew, bone, and joint 
wind-heat, and swollen sores; it should be soaked in wine 
to use." Many of the combinations in the various materia 
medica texts call for soaking Trachelospermi Caulis (luo shi 
teng) in wine, either by itself or in combination with other 
herbs such as Eleutherococci gracilistyli Cortex (wu jia pi) 
and Achyranthis bidentatae Radix (niu xl). Li Shi-Zhen 
quotes a passage from the sixth-century work Medicinal 
Combining which says that Trachelospermi Caulis (luo 
shi teng) is "enhanced by Eucommiae Cortex (du zhang) 
and Moutan Cortex (mu dan pi), antagonizes Ferri Frusta 
(sheng tie luo), and counteracts Fritillariae Bulbus (bei mu) 
and Acori tatarinowii Rhizoma (shi chang pu)." 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica provides 
the following description: 
This substance grows as a vine, very tough and fibrous, 
generating roots at each joint, thus it excels at mobiliz-
ing the channels and collaterals, pervading and spreading 
through the limbs and joints. The Divine Husbandman's 
primary indications are wind-heat with lifeless muscles; 
Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians [states that it] 
nourishes the Kidneys, governs lumbar and sacral pain, 
fortifies the sinews, facilitates joint [movement J-ail of 
this is the correct view. As to its treatment of swollen sores, 
swelling of the throat and tongue, dry mouth and scorched 
tongue [also mentioned in these texts], all of these are the 
effects of bitter, cold draining and directing downward.

Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "collateral stone vine" 
Also known simply as collateral stone (~i};t; luo shi), the 
proper herb is the stem of Trachelospermum jasminoides. 
As noted below in ADULTERANTS, the stem of Ficus pumila, 
which is popular in the Shanghai area, has in recent years 
been marketed as Trachelospermi Caulis (luo shi teng). It 
is quite different in appearance, and somewhat different in 
therapeutic effect: it dispels wind-dampness, but invigo-
rates rather than cools the blood, and also resolves toxicity. 
A number of other species are also used as this herb (see 
ADULTERANTS below). 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of green stems with many leaves. 
Major known chemical constituents 
lndol alkaloids: coronaridine, ibogaine, voacangine, voacangine-7-
hydroxyindolenine, 19-epi-voacangine, tabernaemontanine, voba-
sine, apparicine, conoflorine 
Lignanes: arctiin, matairesinoside, tracheloside, nortracheloside 
Flavonoids: apigenin, luteolin, luteolin-7-0-glucoside, luteolin-4·-o-
glucoside, luteolin-7-0-gentiobioside, apigenin-7-0-glucoside, api-
genin-7-0-neohesperidoside, vicenin-2 
Triterpenes: 8-amyrin, 8-amyrin acetate, lupeol, lupeol acetate, IS-
