Herbs that Expel Parasites 
................................. ........... ....................... ...... ............................................ ·· - ·· ··--~·----
THE HERBS IN THIS CHAPTER are used primarily for 
treating intestinal parasites such as roundworms, 
tapeworms, and hookworms. Patients with parasites often 
experience such symptoms as para-umbilical pain, vomit-
ing, change in appetite or deranged appetite (such as pica), 
and itching in such places as the rectum, nose, or ears. If the 
condition is prolonged they may become wan and fatigued 
with emaciated bodies and distended abdomens. However, 
it is important to remember that many people with para-
sites have no overt symptoms; their problem may only be 
revealed by stool examination. 
Herbs must be matched to the particular parasite and 
the strength or weakness of the individual patient. While 
they are neither as strong as many of the modern antipara-
sitic drugs nor as rapid in onset of action, these herbs have 
less toxicity and their effect is more long-term. Some of 
the herbs also strengthen the Spleen and, in combination 
with other substances, can be used in treating the weak and 
debilitated. However, these herbs should always be used 
with caution in such cases. 
The herbs are usually taken on an empty stomach 
to increase their activity. When a patient has a fever or 
relatively severe abdominal pain, it is a good idea to avoid 
using antiparasitic herbs. They should also be used with 
caution during pregnancy.

Commentary 
Sweet and warm, Quisqualis Fructus (shl jun zi) aug-
ments the Spleen and Stomach while killing parasites. It 
is a particularly important herb for driving out and killing 
roundworms, and is an appropriate choice where there 
is abdominal pain due to parasitic accumulation, child-
hood nutritional impairment, and poor digestion. Because 
Quisqualis Fructus (shf jun zi) is relatively nontoxic, aro-
matic, and sweet tasting, it is quite easy to take just by 
chewing and swallowing, without the need for downward-
draining herbs. Hence it is especially suitable for children. 
The Grand Materia Medica observes that 
This substance is sweet and warm; while it kills parasites, 
it also augments the Spleen and Stomach, so it can restrain 
heat from deficiency and stop diarrhea and dysenteric dis-
orders. It is an important herb for all childhood disorders. 
The Materia Medica of the Kaibao Era says that it "governs 
all types of childhood nutritional impairment with white 
turbidity in the urine, and remedies diarrhea and dysen-
teric disorders." 
In Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, 
Zhang Shan-Lei elaborates: 
The sweet warmth of Quisqualis Fructus (shi jfm zi) is a 
harmonious warmth, quite different from drying warmth, 
in that it assists the transportation and transformation of 
food and drink. It also dredges accumulated stagnation 
from within the Intestines, and because it is rich in fatty 
oils, its slipperiness facilitates free flow [of stool]. The 
Kaibao mentions 'white turbidity in the urine', which refers 
to a symptom of childhood nutritional impairment: when 
children have abdominal distention and accumulation, 
most often the urine is like powdery syrup [viscous with 
sediment]. This is a failure of the urinary pathways within 
the Kidneys to clearly separate out and drain, and is in fact 
the essential fluids transformed from food and drink, which 
are passed out through the urine. It is very commonly seen, 
and definitely not to be mistaken for the turbid red-and-
white urine of adults. The Kaibao also mentions 'remedies 
diarrhea and dysenteric disorders'; this is also one of the 
symptoms of childhood nutritional impairment. When 
the digestion is impaired, the stool changes, with either 
diarrhea or accumulated stagnation. This herb can assist 
digestion while also eliminating accumulated stagnation, 
and thereby treat both. Li Shi-Zhen pointed out that it aug-
ments the Spleen and Stomach while expelling heat from 
deficiency: this is the intention when treating all childhood 
disorders. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
);;> WITH ALOE (lu hul) 
Quisqualis Fructus (shf jun zi) is sweet and warm, while 
Aloe (lu hul) is very bitter and cold. In the Large Intestine, 
Aloe (lu hul) drains fire and unblocks stool, dries damp-
ness, and kills parasites, and in the Liver channel it cools 
the Liver and clears heat. But among these three actions, 
cooling the Liver and relieving constipation are primary: its 
ability to kill parasites is rather mild. 
Together their intestinal parasite expelling action is 
much increased, and there is an ability to drain heat and 
reduce accumulation. Hence it is appropriate for parasitic 
accumulation in the Intestines associated with constipation 
due to overabundant heat.

Traditional Contraindications 
"Hot tea is forbidden to drink [with this herb]: those who 
do will have diarrhea." (Grand Materia Medica) 
"Children with Spleen and Stomach cold from deficiency 
should also not take it; doing so excessively will cause hie-
cough . . .. If there is no parasitic accumulation, consuming 
it will definitely cause injury to a person." (Treasury of 
Words on the Materia Medica)
