Additional product information 
The product from Sichuan ( Jl[ .i! chuan lfan) is considered the best 
quality. To request the highest quality product, the prescription 
should specify true Sichuan coptis ( 1. Jl[ .i! zhen chuan lfan) or top-
class Sichuan coptis ( .1:. Jl[ .i! sh8ng chuan lfan). Because the roots 
of this product are many-branched, often with three to six in a 
crooked bunch, which resemble the talons of an eagle or chicken, 
the names eagle-claw coptis (ilJi\.i! ylng zhua /ian) or chicken-
claw coptis ($1tli\.i! F zhua I fan) are often specified as well. And 
because these rootlets are considerably smaller than the Coptidis 
Rhizoma (huang /ian) produced in other areas of the country, some 
also call it small Sichuan coptis (-1-JI[ .i! xTao chuan lfan) or fine 
Sichuan coptis (~IB Jl[ .i! xi chuan lfan). 
In general, the wild-crafted variety is considered superior to 
the cultivated herb, with that from the area around Mt. Emei in 
Sichuan ("'*.Jg Yf.i! e mei ye /ian) thought to be the best qual-
ity. Among the cultivated products, that from the Ya'an area of 
Sichuan, called $.1! ya lfan, is recognized as superior and of bet-
ter quality than the culitvated variety of Coptis chinensis, which is 
known as ot.i! wei /ian. 
Coptis from Yunnan (~.i! yun lfan) is of acceptable quality, but 
inferior to that from Sichuan.

Commentary 
Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) is bitter, cold, and directs 
qi downward. It is best for draining fire from excess affect-
ing the Kidneys, and clearing lower burner damp-heat. It 
is often used in the treatment of steaming bones and con-
sumptive heat, nightsweats, and spermatorrhea. However, 
Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) is also effective for jaun-
dice, hot-type dysenteric disorders resulting from damp-
heat, vaginal discharge, turbid painful urinary dribbling, 
hemorrhoids, and hematuria. 
The Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Med-
ica says that Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) "controls 
clumped heat in the organs, Stomach and Intestines, jaun-
dice, and hemorrhoids; alleviates diarrhea and dysen-
teric disorders, gynecological red-and-white discharge, 
and ulceration of the vulva." In his writings, Zhu Dan-Xi 
implied that Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) tonified the 
Kidney yin, and this statement still appears in the literature 
from time to time, despite the warnings of later commenta-
tors such as Zhang Jie-Bin: 
When water is dried up, how could bitterness tonify? Yin 
deficiency, exhaustion of water, directing it downward it 
becomes ever more devastated, extinguishing the primal 
yang; there is nothing more extreme than this herb. If water 
is not dried, but fire is abundant, then using it to pull the 
fuel from beneath the stove is enough; once the water is 
spent and the dryness becomes heat, using this to tonify yin 
is truly difficult ... it should not be regarded as a tonifying 
herb! 
The Materia Medica of Combinations describes how Phello-
dendri Cortex (huang bai) "tonifies" the yin, and then how 
it does not: 
[It] toniiies water by its ability to clear the yin-fire blaz-
ing upward from below: when the fire is cleared, water 
is fortified and congeals [as is normal]-this is tonifying 
without tonifying. Note that this pathogenic heat in the 
midst of yin is not originally the true fire of the gate of 
vitality, and so there is no harm in using bitter, cold herbs 
to expel it. If [however] the true water of the Kidneys is 
insufficient so that the true fire floats deficiently upward, 
then Rehmanniae Radix (sheng dl huang) and Rehmanniae 
Radix preparata (shu dl huang) must be used to enrich 
the Kidneys. When the water is sufficient, fire will natu-
rally return to its place of containment. If Anemarrhenae 
Rhizoma (zhl mu) and Phellodendri Cortex (huang bcii) 
are mistakenly used, as the water becomes dried [by their 
bitterness], the fire will blaze even higher, and contrary to 
one's intention, yang will become separated from yin and 
fly away. This is irremediable. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
:;.;.. WITH ANEMARRHENAE RHIZOMA (zhlmu) 
This is one of the most frequently used combinations for 
clearing heat. The Grand Materia Medica explains why: 
When the Kidneys suffer dryness, the acrid flavor should 
be consumed to moisten. When the Lungs suffer rebel-
lious qi, the bitter flavor should be consumed to drain it. 
Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhl mu) is acrid, bitter, cold, 
and cooling, nurturing the Kidney yin in the lower body 
to eliminate dryness, while clearing Lung metal in the 
upper body to drain fire. Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mu) 
acts at the qi level in both the Kidney and Lung channels. 
Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) in the Kidney channel is a 
blood-level herb, thus both herbs should be used together. 
Both herbs are bitter and cold, clearing heat and direct-
ing downward. Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) drains 
and directs the fire affecting the Kidneys downward; 
Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhl mu) drains and directs Lung 
metal heat downward. Together their fire-clearing action is

2 I Herbs that Clear Heat 
vastly enhanced, and by clearing fire, the yin is protected, 
thus preserving the foundation and source of well-being. 
However, if the fire is originally due to deficiency of 
yin, it is essential that herbs that directly nourish the yin 
also be used. (See the passage from Materia Medica of 
Combinations in the CoMMENTARY section above.) 
This combination also clears lower burner damp-heat, 
which can be attributed to the drying and draining actions 
of their bitter flavors, and of course their cooling proper-
ties. The two herbs are therefore often combined in treating 
scanty, dark urine, loose stools that leave an uncompleted 
sensation, or thick, turbid vaginal discharge. Depending on 
the relative preponderance of heat versus dampness, other 
herbs are combined as needed. 
::;... WITH ATRACTYLODIS RHIZOMA ( cang zhu) 
Zhu Dan-Xi noted about this combination: "Phellodendri 
Cortex (huang bai) combined with Anemarrhenae Rhi-
zoma (zhf mu) enriches the yin and directs fire downward, 
but when combined with Atractylodis Rhizoma ( cang zhu), 
it eliminates dampness and clears heat." 
Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) is bitter, cold, and 
downward-directing by nature, and is thus best at clearing 
damp-heat from the lower burner. Atractylodis Rhizoma 
(cang zhu) is acrid and therefore dispersing, warm and 
therefore drying; it is best at transforming dampness to 
assist the transportive function of the Spleen, and is indi-
cated for dampness in both the exterior and interior of 
the body. Together the dampness-drying action of these 
herbs is much enhanced, while the warmth of Atractylodis 
Rhizoma (cang zhu) prevents injury to the yang from the 
coldness of Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai), which in turn 
prevents the warmth of Atractylodis Rhizoma (cang zhu) 
from contributing to pathogenic heat. This combination 
is therefore commonly used for lower burner damp-heat 
with pain, swelling, and weakness in the lower limbs, or for 
damp-heat vaginal discharge or damp-heat sores. Harm 
and Benefit in the Materia Medica notes that Phellodendri 
Cortex (huang bai) "combined with Atractylodis Rhizoma 
(cang zhu) regulates painful obstruction in the leg and 
knee." See Two-Marvel Powder (er miilo scm). 
::;... WITH GARDENIAE FRUCTUS (zhf zf) 
Both herbs are bitter and cold. Gardeniae Fructus (zhl 
zi) resolves constraint and directs downward, and is best 
at clearing Liver channel fire and heat, and eliminating 
pathogenic dampness from the Liver and Gallbladder. 
Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) drains damp-heat and 
clears steaming constraint. The combination is used to 
clear heat and transform dampness, and is effective in 
clearing yang-type jaundice due to damp-heat constrained 
internally. This combination is thus most effective when 
the jaundice includes noticeable fever, the eyes and skin are 
markedly yellow-orange in color, and there are also symp-
toms of thirst, dark scanty urine, and a red tongue with a 
yellow coating. It is also good for lower burner damp-heat 
leading to hot, painful, urinary dribbling. 
Comparisons 
::;... Vs. CoPTIDrs RHIZOMA (huang /ian) and ScuTELLARIAE 
RADIX (huang qin) 
All three herbs clear heat, drain fire, resolve toxicity, and 
dry dampness, and all can be used for symptoms associ-
ated with damp-heat or heat toxin with overwhelming fire. 
They are often combined in prescriptions. Despite their 
numerous similarities, however, there are also significant 
differences. Each herb excels at producing certain effects: 
Scutellariae Radix (huang qin) is best for draining Lung fire, 
and also quiets the fetus in pregnancy; Coptidis Rhizoma 
(huang /ian) is best for draining Heart and Stomach fire, 
stopping nausea and focal distention in the middle burner; 
Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) primarily drains Kidney 
fire, and also excels at reducing lower burner damp-heat. 
::;... Vs. AILANTHI CoRTEX (chiin pi); see page 876 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Strictly forbidden for illness due to cold from deficiency. 
... The pulse at the proximal position must be large, flood-
ing, and strong before Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) can 
be used." (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
There is one report of allergic skin reaction after oral inges-
tion of this herb. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "yellow fir" 
::;... DRY-FRIED PHELLODENDRON (:kj,'-Jif;j-8 chao huang biii) 
Dry-fried until slightly scorched, this is also known as pro-
cessed phellodendron (~ lii ;fa zhi huang biii). An ancient 
adage suggests that "The bitter-coldness of Phellodendri 
Cortex (huang bai) readily causes loose stools, and over 
the long term will injure the Stomach." Dry-frying or bak-
ing can ameliorate its cold quality and reduce the potential 
damage to the Spleen and Stomach. Dry-fried phelloden-
dron is also often used to direct lower burner fire down-
ward and protect the Kidney water.
