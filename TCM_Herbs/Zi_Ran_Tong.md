70 I Herbs that Regulate the Blood 
647 
scopariae Herba (yin chen) and called bell capillaris (#00 
ft ling yin chen) or golden clock capillaris ( ~1:! 00 ft jln 
zhang yin chen). Obviously, this lack of congruity between 
its nomenclature and usage requires attention, and it is now 
generally recommended by materia medica experts that 
it be specified in prescriptions as yin-moving herb (ft1t 
1jt yin xfng cc'lo). Its clinical actions are described as some-
where between those of Artemisiae scopariae Herba (yin 
chen) and Artemisiae anomalae Herba (liu jl nu): invigo-
rating the blood, reducing swelling, and stopping pain, but 
also clearing heat and facilitating urination. It is therefore 
most appropriate for damp-heat disorders involving blood 
stasis, amenorrhea due to fluid retention, or topically for 
trauma. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality has many green leaves and yellow flower 
spikes. 
Major known chemical constituents 
Volatile oil: cinnamic acid, trans-o-hydroxycinnamic acid, trans-o-
hydroxy-p-methoxycinnamic acid

Actions & Indications

blood caused by external injury and (especially) fractures. 
Also thought to promote the healing of fractures. 
-
With Lycopi Herba (ze ian) and Paeoniae Radix rubra 
(chi shao) for pain due to blood stasis. 
- With Olibanum (ru xiang) and Myrrha (mo yao) as both 
an internally-ingested decoction and an external wash, for 
pain and swelling from traumatic injury, as in Trauma Pill

Commentary 
Acrid and neutral, Pyritum (zi ran tong) enters the blood 
aspect of the Liver channel to invigorate the blood, and is 
particularly good at dispersing stasis to stop pain and assist 
in the healing of injury to the sinews and bones. It treats 
such injuries from trauma as pain from falls, contusions, 
broken bones, and hematoma. It is most often used in 
pills or powders, but can be used in decoction if pulver-
ized. Materia Medica of the Kaibao Era states that it "treats 
breaks and fractures, disperses blood, stops pain, breaks up 
accumulations." Materia M edica ofRi Hua-Zi describes its 
use to anchor and settle the spirit, saying that to "quiet the 
Heart and palpitations with anxiety, grind [it] in wine, then 
drink the wine." 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Once the bones have knit, do not continue to consume."
