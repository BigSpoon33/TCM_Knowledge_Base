## 📖 Overview

Entering the Lung, Stomach, and Spleen channels, *Angelicae Dahuricae Radix* (bai zhi) is acrid, dispersing, aromatic, unblocking, warm, and drying. All of these qualities make it very effective in eliminating dampness. It is best at expelling wind, releasing the exterior, drying dampness, opening the orifices (especially the nose), and relieving pain. It is particularly effective in treating symptoms on the head and face, such as wind-cold induced frontal headaches or pain in the bones under the eyebrows, swelling and pain in the teeth and gums, and sinus obstruction. However, due to its ability to raise yang as well as eliminate dampness, it is also commonly used in the treatment of vaginal discharge, especially when it is prepared by dry-frying.

*Summarizes Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica* many of the characteristics of this herb:

*Angelicae Dahuricae Radix* (bai zhi), warm and full of power, opens the orifices and travels through the exterior. It is a major herb for expelling wind and clearing dampness from the leg yang brightness channel. As such it treats all head and facial symptoms along this channel, which arises from the nose and links to the eyes, thus involving the entire face ... but because its nature is rising and dispersing, those with heat in the blood and yin-deficiency fire must avoid it. ... It can be slightly fried.
