## 📖 Overview

Sweet, acrid, and slightly cold, Cimicifugae Rhizoma (*sheng ma*) enters the Lung, Large Intestine, Stomach, and Spleen channels to raise the yang qi, clear heat, release the exterior, vent measles, and resolve toxicity.

The *Grand Materia Medica* quotes Zhang Yuan-Su as saying that this herb has four functions: 1) it guides into the arm and leg yang brightness channel; 2) it raises yang from under the deepest yin; 3) it expels pathogenic wind from above the highest and from the skin; and 4) it treats yang brightness headache.

Li Gao prescribed Cimicifugae Rhizoma (*sheng ma*) for Spleen and Stomach heat from deficiency floating at the muscle layer, combining it with herbs like Bupleuri Radix (*chai hu*), Puerariae Radix (*ge gen*), and Saposhnikoviae Radix (*fang feng*); this is a method for raising yang and dispersing fire. Because this is an internally-generated rather than an externally-contracted condition, other additions would include such herbs as Ginseng Radix (*ren shen*), Paeoniae Radix Alba (*bai shao*), and Glycyrrhizae Radix (*gan cao*). Li also emphasized that Cimicifugae Rhizoma (*sheng ma*) could be used to moderate spasms of the Girdle vessel, referring to a dragging sensation in the lower body, usually accompanied by vaginal discharge.

Zhang Yuan-Su stated that "herbs that tonify the Spleen and Stomach will not be effective without Cimicifugae Rhizoma (*sheng ma*) to guide their use." Because this herb can guide the rising clear qi of the middle burner upward, it can also lead the qi of sweet, warm herbs upward to tonify the spreading release of protective qi and fill the skin. Therefore, for patients with deficiency of Spleen and Stomach primal qi, Cimicifugae Rhizoma (*sheng ma*) can be used to raise the clear yang from within the yin up into the Heart and Lungs. For this purpose it is often combined with Bupleuri Radix (*chai hu*).

Li Shi-Zhen emphasized that, after middle age, the Spleen qi tends to sink; the use of lifting herbs then becomes essential:

Generally, for people over fifty years of age, their qi is being dissipated more and generated less; more qi is descending and less is rising. The nature of autumn in their lives predominates, rather than springtime. Those whose constitutions are weak and whose primal qi is sinking would benefit from Cimicifugae Rhizoma (*sheng ma*) used adroitly in their treatment. *Basic Questions* states that "For those in whom the yin essence ascends, longevity; for those in whom the yang essence descends, early death." In ten thousand generations, only two have plumbed these mysteries and explained these subtleties- Zhang Yuan-Su and Li Gao.

Li Shi-Zhen also found this herb to be of great use in treating toxic conditions:

Because it is first and foremost a yang brightness channel herb, and its nature lifts and disperses ... for toxin in the upper body, use Cimicifugae Rhizoma (*sheng ma*) to cause vomiting; for toxin in the lower body, use Curcumae Radix (*yu jin*) to drive it downward. Alternatively, the two herbs can be taken together: if they do not vomit [it out], it will be driven downward. This combination has saved the lives of many people.

*Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica* explains the rationale behind the apparently contradictory use of Cimicifugae Rhizoma (*sheng ma*) for dysenteric disorders as well as bowel and urinary obstruction:

Tenesmus results from qi stagnation in the middle, which must first ascend before it is able to properly descend. In some diseases with obstructed bowels and urine, qi-moving herbs have no effect, but if Cimicifugae Rhizoma (*sheng ma*) is used with a larger dosage, surprisingly, the obstruction clears. [Zhu] Dan-Xi says: When the qi rises, then water naturally descends.

This hints at an interesting method for treating constipation, which differs from the usual downward-draining approach: utilize the ascending action of Cimicifugae Rhizoma (*sheng ma*) to relieve the downward pressure in the Intestines, freeing the flow of qi so that normal rhythmic motion resumes. Combinations for this purpose include Cimicifugae Rhizoma (*sheng ma*) and Arecae Semen (*bing lang*) to lift the qi and ease the Intestines, or Cimicifugae Rhizoma (*sheng ma*) plus Angelicae Sinensis Radix (*dang gui*) or Persicae Semen (*tao ren*) to raise the clear qi (thereby allowing turbidity to descend) while moistening the bowels.

In fact, *Materia Medica of Combinations* recommends that Angelicae Sinensis Radix (*dang gui*), Cistanches Herba (*rou cong rong*), and Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix (*niu xi*) be combined with Cimicifugae Rhizoma (*sheng ma*) specifically for "unblocking stool parched by deficiency."

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Because this herb has an ascending, floating nature, it should not be used whenever there is floating yang with yin deficiency, wheezing and fullness in the chest with a sense of qi rebelling upward, or for measles after the rash has been expressed.

*Essentials of the Materia Medica* warns: "If the lower origin is deficient and this is used to lift, and then the lower origin becomes more deficient, one should be cautious." In other words, one must ensure that herbs that tonify the primal qi are included to prevent this from occurring.

Most materia medica texts warn that this herb is not suitable for yin deficiency with fire, but *Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica* elaborates on other concerns:

It is forbidden in those with yin-deficiency fire disturbance, cough with profuse phlegm, rebellious qi with vomiting and nausea, palpitations, and severe palpitations and withdrawal-mania. Those with spitting-up of blood or nosebleed who take it by mistake will find the blood following the qi upward, such that the blood flows ceaselessly like a spring.
