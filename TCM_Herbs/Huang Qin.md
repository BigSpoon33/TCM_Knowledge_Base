## üìñ Overview

Bitterness dries dampness, and coldness clears heat; these are the two attributes of Scutellariae Radix (Huang Qin), whose actions focus primarily on the Lungs, and somewhat less directly on the Large Intestine. However, if matched properly with other herbs, it can clear fire, heat, or damp-heat from the Spleen, Liver, Gallbladder, and Small Intestine channels.

Scutellariae Radix (Huang Qin) is often used in the treatment of persistent irritability with fever in febrile disorders, damp-heat focal distention, jaundice, diarrhea, and dysenteric disorders due to damp-heat. It is a noted fetal-quieting herb, benefiting both the mother and the fetus when heat disturbs the pregnancy. For this purpose, it is best used dry-fried or baked, so that its bitterness and coldness are moderated. It is often used for bleeding from internal heat, nosebleed, sores and swellings, and red, swollen, sore eyes.

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica observes:

Scutellariae Radix (Huang Qin) is a very bitter and very cold herb which generally treats all damp-heat. Its nature is quite similar to Coptidis Rhizoma (Huang Lian); thus, in its main sphere of therapeutics it is often combined to act together with Coptidis Rhizoma (Huang Lian). Furthermore, while its bitter flavor is directed straight downward, its aroma is light and clearing; thus, it penetrates both above and below, reaching the organs internally, while externally reaching all the muscles, flesh, and skin.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in cases of cold from deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach.
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica explains that, despite all the virtues of Scutellariae Radix (Huang Qin), "still its bitterness can harm the Stomach because of its downward-directing [action], and thus it necessarily depletes generative qi." It goes on to comment on the general use of this herb in pregnancy, made popular by Zhu Dan-Xi:

Dan-Xi established Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (Bai Zhu) and Scutellariae Radix (Huang Qin) as sage-like herbs for quieting the fetus. He said that during pregnancy, the heat should be cleared and the blood should be cooled, so that the blood did not move chaotically, as only then could it nourish the fetus. His theory is not incorrect, but later physicians came to regard Scutellariae Radix (Huang Qin) as an essential herb for the pregnant mother, and it even became a common folk remedy that was invariably used in pregnancy. Yet constitutions are not inevitably hot- what is the reason for its general use? Zhang Lu [in Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica] stated that Scutellariae Radix (Huang Qin) is appropriate for fetal heat leading to restless raising movement, but for fetal cold leading to descent, or for poor appetite and diarrhea, it should not be rashly employed-this is accurate.
