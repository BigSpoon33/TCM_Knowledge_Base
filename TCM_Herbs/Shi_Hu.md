DRY-FRIED AsPARAGus TuBER(#'~~ chao ticm dong) 
Sections or slices of the herb are dry-fried or baked until 
slightly yellow. This method of preparation reduces their 
greasy, cloying effect and facilitates digestion. It is also 
known as dear-fried asparagus Ot:J:J *-. ~ qzng chao tian 
dong). 
>
PREPARED ASPARAGUS TUBER (9(_*-.~ zhl ti{ln dong) 
Sections or slices of the herb are mixed with honey and then 
dry-fried until the honey has been absorbed and the herb 
has turned dark yellow. This is also known as honey-pre-
pared asparagus (Jf *--*--~ ml zhl tian dong) and enables 
the herb to better moisten the Lungs and stop coughs due 
to Lung yin deficiency. 
>
CINNABAR AsPARAGus TuBER C*-*-~ zhu tian dong) 
The tubers are sprayed with water to moisten them, left 
covered briefly, then sprayed with finely powdered Cinna-
baris (zhu sha) and stirred until evenly coated. This method 
endows the herb with a spirit-calming action that is most 
appropriate when treating insomnia, irritability, or emo-
tional disturbance associated with Lung and Kidney yin 
deficiency.

C AUTIONS AND C ONTRAINDICATION$ 
This herb can have the 
effect of retaining pathogens and aiding dampness, and 
therefore should not be used in the early stages of a warm 
pathogen disease, especially damp-warmth that has not 
yet transformed into dry-heat. It is also contraindicated in 
those with loose stools due to Spleen deficiency or those 
with a thick, greasy tongue coating. 
Actions & Indications 
• Nourishes the yin, clears heat, and generates fluids: for

... Add Astragali Radix (huang qi) if the qi is also defi-
cient, manifested in irritability and fatigue.

Commentary 
Slightly salty, bland, sweet, and cold, Dendrobii Herba (shi 
hu) enters the Stomach and Kidney channels, and is best 
at nourishing the Stomach yin, expelling heat from defi-
ciency, and treating injury to the yang fluids in the after-
math of a warm pathogen disease with such manifestations 
as a scarlet tongue with little coating, insatiable thirst, and 
a persistent low-grade fever. The Detailed Materia Medica 
says that it "reinforces the Kidneys without injurious 
heat, and calms the Stomach without injurious drying: a 
substance of middle harmony." Extension of the Materia 
Medica adds that it "treats heat from deficiency in the 
Stomach." Although it is listed as a superior medicinal in 
the Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica, it 
was not until the publication of Miao Xi-Yong's Commen-
tary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica, 
and its influence on the famous physicians Ye Tian-Shi and 
Wang Meng-Ying, that it became really popular. 
Omissions from the Grand Materia Medica notes that 
using this herb as a tea can "clear Stomach heat, expel heat 
from deficiency, generate fluids, unbind the Stomach, and 
strengthen the Spleen." For use as a tea it must be boiled for 
at least 30 minutes before pouring into a thermos cup, from 
which it can be sipped while still warm, like tea. 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica has this 
advice: 
Cut it open and boil it first [before the other herbs] in order 
to obtain its true flavor. This substance is very resistant 
to long decocting: it will only have an effect if the herb 
is boiled by itself until concentrated. If mixed with other 
herbs and simmered for 30 or 40 minutes, its flavor will not 
yet have emerged. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations

Comparisons 
};;>- Vs.TRICHOSANTHIS RADIX (tian huafen) 
Both herbs generate fluids and alleviate thirst, nourish the 
yin and clear heat, and enrich the Stomach. They are often 
used together as their actions are mutually complemen-
tary. However, Dendrobii Herba (shi hu) is sweet, bland, 
slightly salty, and cold by nature, whereas Trichosanthis 
Radix (tiiin huii fen) is sweet and cold. Dendrobii Herba 
(shi hu) enters the Kidneys and Stomach, enriching the 
Kidney essence, and its ability to cool heat from deficiency 
is superior to that of Trichosanthis Radix (tian hua fen). 
By contrast, Trichosanthis Radix (tian huii fen) primarily 
enters the Lungs and Stomach, more strongly generates 
fluids, and also directs phlegm-fire downward, expels pus, 
and reduces swelling.

POLYGONATI ODORATI RHIZOMA (yu zhu) 
All three of these herbs enter the Stomach channel and clear

12 I Tonifying Herbs 
heat, nourish the yin, and generate fluids, and all are used 
in the treatment of Stomach yin and fluid insufficiency with 
such problems as dry mouth, thirst, and wasting and thirst-
ing disorder. Both Glehniae/ Adenophorae Radix (sha shen) 
and Polygonati odorati Rhizoma (yu zhu) also enter the 
Lung channel and are therefore used to treat coughs due to 
Lung yin deficiency. 
However, each of these herbs has its own particular 
strengths. Glehniae/Adenophorae Radix (sha shen) is best 
at clearing the Lungs and moistening what is dry. It is 
most effective for dry coughs with little sputum or blood-
streaked sputum. Polygonati odorati Rhizoma (yu zhu) is 
better at enriching and moistening. Because it nourishes 
the yin without being greasy, its effect in retaining patho-
gens is slight, hence it is used for those with underlying yin 
deficiency who also have an externally-contracted disease. 
Dendrobii Herba (shi hu) is better at clearing heat and is 
frequently used when a febrile disease has injured the flu-
ids. It is also effective in reducing heat from yin deficiency, 
and can be used for visual disorders, dizziness, and weak-
ness in the lower back and legs. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Only appropriate for those with Stomach and Kidney fire 
from deficiency; should be avoided where there is deficien-
cy without fire." (Mirror of the Hundred Herbs) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "bushel of stone" 
Both fresh and dried dendrobium are used. Fresh dendro-
bium (.~t ;G AA xian shi hu) is simply the freshly collected 
stems, which are buried in sand until they are ready to be 
dispensed. It is also commonly known as fresh fiat whorls 
(.~t~ 4 xian biiin d6u). Dried dendrobium (T ;G AA gan 
shi hu) is the prepared form of the herb. 
~ Gow DENDROBIUM ( ~ 
;G AA jfn shi hu) 
This name can refer to all types of dendrobium, especially 
when found in a prescription, but is also the shortened 
name for Dendrobium nobile (gold hairpin dendrobium ~ 
~;G AA jfn chai shi hu). 
~ EARRING DENDROBIUM (JfJ{ ;G AA er hudn shi hu) 
This is made from the separated young stems of D. chry-
santhum or D. candidum. It is 4-7cm long, with the rootlets 
removed, half-sliced lengthwise to lay out fiat as a strip. 
The strips are heated until soft and then rolled into a ball 
or shaped like a spring, after which they are heated and 
rolled again. This process is repeated several times until the 
rolls no longer lose their shape, after which a final heating 
dries them completely. Earring dendrobium is also known 
as maple whorls (;fil4 feng d6u). Good quality consists of 
yellowish green, full, and solid pieces. 
Some types of dendrobium have slightly different uses. 
D. candidum (il&:.Xi AA tie pi shi hu) is most effective in 
enriching the yin, generating fluids, and eliminating heat. 
D. nobile ( ~~;G AA jfn chai shi hu) is weaker. Earring den-
drobium generates fluids, but is not cool in nature; it can be 
taken daily as a tea. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of golden yellow, glossy, and pliable 
stems. For the fresh herb, good quality consists of green, 
full stems with many leaves.
