## üìñ Overview

The sweetness of *Angelicae sinensis Radix* (dang gui) tonifies and moistens, its acrid flavor disperses, its bitterness drains, and its warmth unblocks. These properties make it the most appropriate herb for harmonizing the blood, which means that it both invigorates and tonifies the blood, and is suitable for all blood patterns involving stasis, deficiency, dryness, or cold. When the blood is sufficient and moves harmoniously, the qi will also circulate properly; the Grand Materia Medica therefore calls this an herb "for the qi within the blood." Proper movement of both qi and blood eliminates pain, expels wind, restores normal menstrual flow, assists healing, and moistens dryness. The type of dryness it particularly addresses is that in the Intestines causing constipation, as noted in Essentials of the Materia Medica, which says that it "moistens dryness and lubricates the Intestines."

In Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western, Zhang Xi-Chun notes that this herb is sweet, slightly acrid, rich in fluids, and warm in nature. It is the primary herb for generating blood and invigorating blood, but it also disseminates and unblocks the qi aspect, inducing the qi and blood to return [to their proper place], hence the name 'state of return'. Its power can raise because it is strong and steady in action, and warm; it can direct downward because its flavor is rich and acrid; internally, it moistens the organs because of its concentrated fluids and sweetness; externally, it thrusts out to the muscle layer because of its acrid, warm nature.

Although *Angelicae sinensis Radix* (dang gui) is warm, it can still be used if there is heat with blood deficiency, because, as it can generate blood, it enriches the yin, and by enriching the yin, it can reduce heat. Although its exterior-dispersing property is rather weak, it actually excels at expelling wind, because when wind contacts the body it tends to cause painful obstruction of blood, and blood, once invigorated, unblocks the area of obstruction, so that wind naturally departs.

Cheng Wu-Ji, one of the earliest commentators on Discussion of Cold Damage, is quoted in the Grand Materia Medica as saying that:

The vessels are the dwelling of blood, and all blood belongs to the Heart. In order to unblock the vessels, one must first tonify the Heart and augment the blood. Therefore, Zhang Zhong-Jing treated 'those with hands and feet that are extremely cold and a pulse that is [so] thin that it is about to be cut off' by using the bitter warmth of *Angelicae sinensis Radix* (dang gui) to assist the Heart blood.

Zhang Yuan-Su observed:

Blood that is clogged and thus unable to flow causes pain, the sweet warmth of *Angelicae sinensis Radix* (dang gui) harmonizes the blood, its acrid warmth disperses internal cold, and its bitter warmth assists the Heart and disperses cold, making qi and blood each return [to normalcy].

*Angelicae sinensis Radix* (dang gui) is well known as the premier herb in gynecology due to its harmonious warmth which is not drying, its tonification, which is not cloying, and its gentle invigoration of the blood, which is not excessive. Nonetheless, during pregnancy, it should only be used with considerable caution, and only after the practitioner has a firm grasp of its clinical use.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in those with diarrhea or abdominal fullness due to abundant dampness.
Acrid and warm, although it tonifies and invigorates the blood, in the end its nature is to promote the movement of blood and mobilize the blood, thus it can cause loose stools. Its qi is incompatible with the Stomach qi, thus it should not be used if the Intestines and Stomach are weak, with loose stools, aversion to food, loss of appetite, or indigestion. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)

"If wind-cold has not cleared, and symptoms of the externally-contracted pathogenic influence are still visible, such as chills and fever, its use is forbidden." (Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica)
