## 📖 Overview

Viticis Fructus (man jing zi) is slightly cold with a clear, acrid, and light floating nature. It moves upward and disperses. It is best at raising and dispersing wind-heat in the face and head, e.g., in cases of externally-contracted wind-heat leading to headache, dizziness, red eyes, or swollen, painful gums and teeth. It also has a certain ability to expel wind-dampness, enabling it to unblock and facilitate the movement of the joints.

Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica describes the varied indications of this herb:

[Although] Viticis Fructus (man jing zi) is regarded as a herb for wind disorders of the face and head, our ancient forebears used it to unblock the nine orifices and facilitate the joints, brighten the eyes and firm up the teeth, expelling wind-cold and wind-heat. ... Thus it is now used for damp painful obstruction, cold bulging disorder, or leg qi. It is used in decoction or powders- the results are always reliable, and not limited to the face and head!

Zhou Yan, however, disagreed. In Records of Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica, he used Viticis Fructus (man jing zi) to illustrate the difficulties in truly understanding the nature of a herb:

Viticis Fructus (man jing zi), according to the Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians, mainly treats wind headaches and ringing in the brain, and its results are indeed quite often remarkable. However, all regard Viticis Fructus (man jing zi) as an acrid, cold herb; they do not know that its bitter warmth is greater than its acrid cold. In the Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica it says that its flavor is bitter and slightly cold- the word "slightly" is used deliberately. Miscellaneous Records amended this to acrid, neutral, and warm, which is closer to the whole picture. But here we should look closely at the significance of this ....

Viticis Fructus (man jing zi) grows in the water margins, the fruit is black and mottled: it is most appropriate for entering the Kidneys. Furthermore, its nature is acrid and cold as well as bitter and warm, which similarly imitates the greater yang's quality of qi transformation: based in cold, but manifesting as heat, able to go from yin out to yang, and using yang to transform yin.

Viticis Fructus (man jing zi) is light and empty so that it rises upward, and despite the statement in the Divine Husbandman that it can treat painful obstruction and spasms from cold, heat, and dampness in the sinews and bones by transforming dampness so as to unblock the obstruction, in the final analysis, Viticis Fructus (man jing zi) simply does not have the fortitude to take on this duty of searching out and expelling. This is why very few ancient formulas use it for this purpose.

Only wind headaches and tinnitus are really its specialty. When it is ineffective, this is because people have not investigated carefully.

On reflection, I have come to realize that the scarcity of those who thoroughly understand Viticis Fructus (man jing zi) is not a new phenomenon. Xu Zhi-Cai stated that it disperses yang brightness channel wind-heat- surprisingly viewing it as no different than Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bo he) or Arctii Fructus (niu bang zi). Zhang Yuan-Su called it yin within yang, when actually it is yang within yin, stating that it cools the blood in all channels, when actually it is a qi herb, not a blood herb at all! The only ones with true knowledge of it were Li Shi-Zhen, who said it mainly treats wind from deficiency of the head and face, and Zhang Lu [in Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica] who said that it was forbidden for blood deficiency with fire- but even here, the reasons behind these statements were not clarified.

What difficulties there are in clearly understanding the materia medica!
