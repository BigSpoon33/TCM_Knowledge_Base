4 I Herbs that Drain Dampness 
317 
Actions & Indications 
• Promotes urination and reduces edema: primarily for 
edema (often floating edema) and ascites. Also used in 
treating end-stage schistosomiasis. 
-
With Alismatis Rhizoma (ze xie) and Polyporus (zhu 
ling) for floating edema. 
-
With Verbenae Herba (rna bian cao) for the edema of 
end-stage schistosomiasis. 
• Cools the blood and resolves toxicity: this is one of the 
herbs of choice for treating poisonous snakebites as well as 
the stings of bees and wasps. It may be used internally or 
applied topically. Also used for fire toxin patterns, such as 
tonsillitis. 
-
With Scutellariae Radix (huang qin), Coptidis Rhizoma 
(huang !ian), Lonicerae Flos (jfn yin hua), and Chrysan-
themi indici Flos (ye ju hua) for poisonous snakebites. 
Commentary 
Lobeliae chinensis Herba (ban bian !ian) facilitates the 
removal of pathogenic water by virtue of its bland flavor, 
while cooling heat through its slight coldness. It also cools 
the blood and resolves toxicity. 
The accumulation of pathogenic water and dampness 
in the tissues of the skin leads to edema. When the fluid 
pathways of the Triple Burner are unable to maintain 
proper fluid movement, the fluids accumulate internally, 
leading to abdominal distention or even ascites. Lobeliae 
chinensis Herba (him bian !ian) can be used in combina-
tion with other herbs to promote the movement of fluids 
and to reduce edema. 
It can also be used for fire toxin accumulation causing 
sores, abscesses, and ulcerations, sore throat, and toxic 
swellings. It is particularly appropriate for skin disorders 
involving dampness, such as eczema, shingles, and fungal 
infections of the fingers and toes, as it cools the blood, 
clears dampness, and resolves toxicity. It is also used in 
treating end-stage schistosomiasis. 
The older materia medica texts primarily mention its 
use in the treatment of snake and insect bites, for which it 
was both taken internally and applied topically. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
»
WITH VERBENAE HERBA (rna biiin ala) 
Both herbs facilitate the removal of pathogenic fluids and 
reduce swelling, clear heat, and resolve toxicity. Together 
their ability to facilitate the removal of pathogenic water is 
much enhanced. 
Comparisons 
» Vs. HEDYOTIS DIFFUSAE HERBA (bai huii she she cao) 
Both herbs facilitate the removal of pathogenic water, 
reduce edema, clear heat, and resolve toxicity, but Lobeliae 
chinensis Herba (bim bian !ian) has a stronger diuretic 
action, while Hedyotis diffusae Herba (bdi hua she she 
cao) has a stronger ability to cool and remove damp-heat, 
and is therefore often preferred in the treatment of painful 
urinary dribbling. The ability to resolve toxicity is similar 
in each. 
Toxicity 
Overdosage may result in poisoning. Symptoms include 
salivation, nausea, headache, diarrhea, hypertension, retar-
dation and later acceleration of the pulse. In severe cases 
there could be spasms, dilatation of the pupils, and even 
death from respiratory paralysis. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "half-edged lily" 
This herb is generally used in its unprepared or fresh state.

and stems, and yellow roots without foreign matter or 
sand.
