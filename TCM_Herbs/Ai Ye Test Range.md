  # Clinical Information
  dosage: "3-9g"
  toxicity: "While there is some controversy on this point, if the dosage is too high, side effects can occur frequently in patients taking this herb. The following symptoms have been reported: dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, gastric discomfort, diarrhea, and dizziness. Substitution of the leaf oil reduced the side effects, except for a mild dry mouth and gastric discomfort in a minority of patients. The oil of this herb produces local irritation and should not be injected.

Overdosage (20-30g) of the herb may cause toxicity with symptoms appearing about 30 minutes after ingestion, including dry and thirsty feeling in the throat, nausea, and vomiting, followed by general weakness, dizziness, tinnitus, and tremors. If the overdosage is repeated, generalized spasms and convulsions may occur. Repeated overdosage can lead to hepatomegaly, jaundice, and even death. Large overdosage can lead to bleeding and miscarriage during pregnancy. Dry-frying and charring the herb significantly reduces its toxic effects."

## 📖 Overview

Bitter, acrid, and warm, Artemisiae Argyi Folium (ai ye 艾葉) enters the Spleen, Liver, and Kidney channels. Its aromatic, acrid flavor disperses, its warmth opens the flow of qi and blood in the three yin channels, and its bitterness dries dampness; thus it is an excellent gynecological herb to dispel cold-dampness and stop cold pain. Its primary applications are patterns of lower burner yang cold from deficiency, such as abdominal cold pain, cold disrupting the menstrual cycle, and infertility due to cold in the Womb.

In its charred form, it can also stop bleeding, and is used in such cases as cold from deficiency causing menorrhagia, irregular uterine bleeding, vaginal discharge, and threatened miscarriage with spotting during early pregnancy.

Externally, it can be used as a wash to expel dampness and stop itching. Recently the oil of this plant has been used to calm wheezing and stop coughs, primarily for cough and wheezing with profuse sputum.

The virtues of this herb in its role as moxa need not be enumerated here.
