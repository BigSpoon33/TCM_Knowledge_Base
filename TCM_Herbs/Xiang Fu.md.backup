## 📖 Overview

The subtle flavors and qualities of Cyperi Rhizoma (香附 xiāng fù) have multiple uses. It is acrid, and thus disperses blocked qi, and slightly bitter, enabling it to direct rebellious qi downward. It is neutral and can thus be used for either hot or cold disorders, and while it mainly enters the qi aspect of the Liver and Triple Burner, it has the effect of promoting qi flow in all twelve channels. Cyperi Rhizoma (香附 xiāng fù) is known for its ability to promote the movement of qi at such a deep level that it strongly influences the movement of blood, and so is known as a herb that 'moves qi within the blood.'

It is appropriate in the treatment of emotional constraint, Liver and Stomach qi stagnation, distending pain in the chest and flanks, food stagnation, nausea, vomiting, and acid regurgitation. It is equally useful when Liver constraint affects blood flow, causing stasis and amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and postpartum disorders due to residual obstruction.

The Grand Materia Medica states that it is neutral in quality, rather than cold. Its aroma can pierce. Its flavor is mainly acrid to disperse, slightly bitter to direct downward, and slightly sweet to harmonize. It is a primary herb for the qi level of the leg terminal yin Liver and arm lesser yang Triple Burner, but likewise unblocks the qi level of all twelve channels. It is the commander-in-chief of qi disorders, and for gynecology, the supreme leader.

Li Shi-Zhen quotes Wang Hao-Gu as saying that it is yin within yang, a herb for the qi within the blood; whenever qi constrains qi and blood it must be used. Fried black it stops bleeding and treats continuous uterine bleeding-it is an immortal herb for women!

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica elaborates, noting that it has a particularly intense acrid flavor and a very rich aroma, and all its effects are through the qi. Thus it specifically treats disorders due to qi clumping. However, as its color contains purple, its center is relatively black, its substance is firm, solid, heavy, and weighty, so even though its qi prevails, it is still different from other acrid, warm, lightweight, raising and lifting herbs. This is why it enters the blood aspect, and reaches downward to the Kidneys and Liver. When Wang Hao-Gu says that it is yin within yang, and a qi-within-blood herb, this is a marvellously deep grasp of the innate law of its nature.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in those with qi deficiency and no stagnation, or in those with yin deficiency and heat, or heat in the blood.

Drying by nature, [Cyperi Rhizoma (香附 xiāng fù)] is a bitter, warm herb that depletes blood and disperses qi; if qi-deficient patients or those weak in blood take it, the concern is that the qi will be harmed and the blood consumed, thus causing other illnesses. Whenever menstruation is early due to blood heat, the method should be to cool the blood-do not use this herb. If it is mistakenly used, the periods will come even earlier!
