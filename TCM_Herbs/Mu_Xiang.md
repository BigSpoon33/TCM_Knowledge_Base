9 I Herbs that Regulate the Qi 
529 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "aromatic appendage" 
In its unprepared (raw) form, it is called unprepared cype-
rus ( 1.-!- Jilt sheng xicmg fo), or Cyperus seeds (-!-Jilt+ 
xiiingfo zi). The Grand Materia Medica observes: 
Raw, it raises and promotes movement in the chest and 
diaphragm, and reaches outward to the skin. Prepared, it 
reaches the Kidneys and Liver, pervading the lower back 
and legs. Charred, it can stop bleeding. 
::;;;.. PROCESSED CYPERUS (~.f. Jilt zhl xiiingfo) 
The herb is boiled together with yellow rice wine and rice 
vinegar, then dried in the sun. This method of preparation 
renders it more effective in dredging the Liver and alleviat-
ing pain than does preparation with either wine or vinegar 
alone. 
::;;;.. BLACK CYPERUS (,~,.f. Jilt hei xiiingfo) 
Dry-fried over high heat until the inside is scorched yellow 
and the outside is scorched black, but not yet misshapen, 
this is also known as charred cyperus (W Jilt A xiiingfo tan). 
This method of preparation enhances its ability to enter the 
Liver blood level to harmonize the blood and stop bleeding, 
and is often used in the treatment of irregular menstrual 
bleeding. 
::;;;.. DRY-FRIED CYPERUS (:kjl.f-JI(t chiioxiiingfo) 
There are many different ways of dry-frying cyperus, and 
each has its peculiar effect: 
Soaked in wine then dry-fried, it mobilizes the channels 
and collaterals; soaked in vinegar then dry-fried, it reduces 
accumulations and masses; soaked in ginger juice then 
dry-fried, it transforms phlegm and thin mucus. (Grand 
Materia Medica) 
Mirror of Medicines adds: "Vinegar-fried cyperus (~:I:)' .f. 
Jilt cu chao xiiing fo) regulates pain due to qi [stagnation] 
marvelously." 
::;;;.. FOUR [SUBSTANCE] PREPARED CYPERUS 
(Im ~-!-Jilt si zhi xiiingfo) 
Soaked in a mixture of four substances (rice vinegar, yellow 
rice wine, cooked honey, and young boy's urine; or wine, 
salt, ginger juice, and young boy's urine), then dry-fried 
until it is dry. There is another ancient method of prepara-
tion involving the use of seven substances, known as seven 
[substance] prepared cyperus ( -1:: ~-!-Jilt q! zhi xiiing fo). 
These are generally listed as wine, vinegar, salt, brown 
sugar, ginger juice, human milk, and young boy's urine. 
These methods of preparation mitigate the drawbacks 
of cyperus-its tendency to exhaust the qi and dry the yin 
and yang fluids-but enhance its ability to promote the 
flow of qi, unblock the collaterals, reduce accumulations, 
and alleviate pain. Thus it is especially appropriate for defi-
cient patients with pathogenic obstruction.

CAUTIONS & CONTRAINDICATIONS 
Use with caution in those 
with depleted fluids, yin deficiency, or blazing fire. See 
TOXICITY below. 
Actions & Indications 
• Promotes the movement of qi and stops pain: for Spleen 
or Stomach stagnant qi with such symptoms as lack of 
appetite, a feeling of food sitting in the stomach, along with 
epigastric or abdominal pain or distention, nausea, and 
vomiting. Also used for stagnant Liver or Gallbladder qi 
with such symptoms as flank pain, distention, or soreness. 
-
With Aurantii Fructus (zhf ke) and Corydalis Rhizoma 
(yan hu suo) for epigastric and abdominal pain and disten-
tion from qi stagnation. 
-
With Amomi Fructus (shii ren) for focal distention, 
epigastric and abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, dysenteric disorders, or tenesmus due 
to qi obstruction and/or food stagnation. 
-
With Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu) 
for loss of appetite with epigastric and abdominal pain and 
distention. 
-
With Bupleuri Radix ( chai hu), Curcumae Radix (yu 
jln), and Artemisiae scopariae Herba (yzn chen) for damp-
heat fomenting and causing flank distention and pain, 
together with a bitter taste. 
-
With Citri reticulatae viride Pericarpium (qzng pi) for 
indigestion, abdominal pain and distention, and belching. 
-
With Arecae Pericarpium ( da fo pi) and Tsaoko Fructus 
(cao guo) to direct the qi downwarnd and guide out stagna-
tion, as in Bolster the Spleen Decoction (shf pf yin). 
• Adjusts and regulates stagnant qi in the Intestines: for diar-
rhea and dysenteric disorders, or for abdominal pain and 
tenesmus. Because of its slightly astringent property, this 
herb is commonly used for treating tenesmus. 
-
With Arecae Semen (bzng lang) and Rhei Radix et 
Rhizoma (da huang) for epigastric and abdominal full-
ness, distention, and pain accompanied by constipation or 
red-and-white dysenteric diarrhea due to stagnation in the 
Stomach and Intestines transforming into damp-heat, as in 
Aucklandia and Areca Pill (mu xiiing bzng lang wan). 
-
With Coptidis Rhizoma (huang lian) for dysenteric 
disorders and diarrhea, especially when accompanied by 
tenesmus and abdominal distention and discomfort, as in 
Aucklandia and Coptis Pill (xiiing lian wan). 
• Strengthens the Spleen and prevents stagnation: used with 
tonifying herbs to ameliorate their side effects. Especially 
useful when the transformative and transportive functions 
of the Spleen are weak. 
-
With Amomi Fructus (shii ren), Ginseng Radix (ren 
shen), and Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu) 
for lack of appetite and abdominal distention and fullness 
which improves when warmth is applied locally, as in Six-
Gentleman Decoction with Aucklandia and Amomum 
(xiiing shii liu jun zi tiing). 
Commentary 
Acrid, bitter, and warm, with a strong, rich aroma, Auc-
klandiae Radix (mu xiiing) enters the Spleen, Stomach, and 
Large Intestine channels. It is best at promoting the flow of 
qi in the Stomach and Intestines to reduce distention and 
alleviate pain, and also strengthening the Spleen and reduc-
ing food stagnation. Thus its primary indications include 
poor digestion, loss of appetite, abdominal distention, and 
diarrhea. It can be used for dysenteric disorders due to 
damp-heat if combined with cooling herbs. It is also helpful 
when combined with tonifying herbs, as it can assist diges-
tion and prevent obstruction due to greasiness. 
The aroma of Aucklandiae Radix (mil xiiing) can unblock 
the flow of qi, harmonize the five organs, and is an impor-
tant herb for regulating all of the qi. When it treats focal

distention, stifling sensation in the chest, belching, edema, 
abdominal distention, or leg qi, all of this is the effect of 
regulating obstruction and dispersing qi. (Transforming the 
Significance of Medicinal Substances) 
The Grand Materia Medica is even more explicit: 
Aucklandiae Radix (mit xiang) is a herb of the Triple 
Burner qi level, raising and directing downward all of the 
qi. All pent-up constrained qi pertains to the Lungs [says 
Basic Questions], thus the reason for using it for upper 
burner qi stagnation is to drain metal constraint. All lack 
of transport of the middle qi pertains to the Spleen, thus it 
is appropriate for middle burner qi stagnation because the 
Stomach enjoys fragrant aromas. When the qi of the Large 
Intestine is obstructed there is tenesmus; when the qi of the 
Bladder does not transform there is urinary blockage or 
painful urinary dribbling; when the qi of the Liver is con-
strained there is pain-thus the reason for using it for lower 
burner qi blockage is to unblock that which is plugged. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
~ WITH ARECAE SEMEN (bzng lang) 
Both herbs promote the flow of qi, but Aucklandiae Radix 
(mil xiiing) warms the middle to promote transporta-
tion and dries dampness, while Arecae Semen (bzng lang) 
reduces accumulation and guides out stagnation, and can 
kill parasites. 
Combining these two herbs not only enhances their 
ability to promote the flow of qi and stop pain, but also 
guides out obstruction, reduces distention, dries damp-
ness, and kills parasites. Thus it is often used in the treat-
ment of qi blockage in the Stomach and Intestines due 
to food stagnation, leading to abdominal distention and 
fullness, loss of appetite, aversion to the smell of food, 
nausea but inability to vomit, and an uncomfortable urge 
to move the bowels which is often unsuccessful. Intestinal 
parasites can lead to a pressing pain around the umbilicus, 
and intermittent focal distention in the abdomen, for which 
this combination is often used. Finally, the two herbs are 
combined to relieve tenesmus, and the passage of mucus, 
in dysenteric disorders. 
Comparisons 
~ Vs. CYPERI RHIZOMA (xiiingfu) 
Both herbs are bitter and acrid, both promote the flow of 
qi and stop pain, and more importantly, both enter the 
Triple Burner channel. The difference is that Auck.landiae 
Radix (mit xiiing) particularly mobilizes clumped qi in the 
Stomach and Intestine channels and reduces food stag-
nation; it is thus specifically indicated for epigastric full-
ness, abdominal distention, and diarrhea. Cyperi Rhizoma 
(xiiingfu), by contrast, dredges and disperses qi stagnation 
in the Stomach and Liver, and is especially good at relieving 
constrained Liver qi, regulating menstruation, and stop-
ping pain; it is specifically indicated for emotional con-
straint, distending pain of the ribs and flanks, and irregular 
menstruation. 
Traditional Contraindications 
Aromatic, drying, and tending toward yang, it is contrain-
dicated for those with Lung deficiency and heat, or parched 
blood dryness. It is also forbidden in all cases of swelling 
and pain involving fire, and primal qi loss or yin defi-
ciency with internal heat. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia 
Medica) 
Toxicity 
One case has been reported of allergic reaction following 
the ingestion of a decoction containing 1 Og of this herb. The 
symptoms developed shortly after ingestion and included 
abdominal discomfort, watery diarrhea, granular rash, pru-
ritus, and restlessness. After continued use the rash spread 
over the entire body, accompanied by severe itching, a feel-
ing of oppression in the chest, abdominal pain, borboryg-
mus, and severe diarrhea. The symptoms disappeared after 
the patient took an antihistamine. Re-exposure of the same 
patient to a decoction of 3g of Aucklandiae Radix induced 
the same symptoms. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "wood fragrance" 
This herb was originally grown in India and the Middle 
East. It is now an endangered plant species in India, and 
a ban was imposed by CITES on its international trade. 
However, the species has been widely cultivated in Yunnan 
province over the last half-century, and it is this cultivated 
product from China that is now used. It is also known as 
Yunnan mil xiiing (?}!; ;f..:t' yun mil xiiing). Trade is permit-
ted for the cultivated product. In its unprepared form, it is 
known as unprepared Aucklandiae Radix (mit xiiing) (1. 
;f..:t' sheng mil xiiing). The Grand Materia Medica says 
that "Whenever used as a qi-regulating herb, it should be 
unprepared; when used to firm the Intestines, it should be 
baked in flour and taken prepared." 
~ BAKED AUCKLANDIA (:J:tt;f..:t' wei mil xiiing) 
Slices of the herb are covered with rough absorbent paper, 
upon which is placed another layer of herb slices covered 
with paper, and so on until several layers have been built 
up. These are placed next to a stove or in a drying room 
until a portion of the volatile oil in the herb has been 
absorbed by the paper. The slices can also be baked in a 
flour bag, with the same effect. The flour is then sifted out.
