## 📖 Overview

*Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bo he)* enters the Lung and Liver channels, is acrid, cool, light in nature, aromatic, and dispersing. Its lightness floats and ascends while its sweet aroma unblocks the orifices. Its best effect is to facilitate the dispersal of wind-heat in the upper burner while treating the effects of wind-heat on the orifices of the head. Its sweat-inducing effect is quite strong. For this reason it is often used to treat sores and rashes on the skin, headache and red eyes, superficial visual obstructions, sore throat, and mouth ulcers.

*Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances* elaborates on the properties of this herb:

"The flavor of *Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bo he)* is acrid, thus it disperses, cool in nature, thus it clears heat, unblocks, and facilitates the meeting places of the six yang channels on the head. It expels pathogenic wind in all fevers. With its penetrating nature and light cooling, it excels at moving over the face and head: it treats loss of voice, mouth and teeth problems, and cools the throat. With its aroma to facilitate the [opening of the] orifices, it excels at moving through the muscle layer of the exterior: it reduces fluid retention and disperses heat in the muscles."

*Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western* notes that *Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bo he)* can vent and bring out cool sweat, and as such it is an important herb for warm pathogen disease which needs release through sweating. If used in small amounts, it is good for harmonious adjustment of the qi in internal disharmonies, and treats pain from Liver qi, Gallbladder fire, constraint and clumping, or Liver qi moving internally. In other words, for Liver constraint, small doses are best.

Here is an illustrative anecdote from Chen Shi-Duo:

"A patient presented with an exterior disorder and qi constraint, but was unwilling to take herbs. I gave him 3g of *Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bo he)*, 3g of Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (*chen pi*), 6g of tea leaves, then poured in boiling water to roll these over several times in a large bowl. He drank it and was immediately better. I only relate this to illustrate the extraordinary effects of *Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bo he)*."

Zhang Xi-Chun describes the actions of this herb:

"*Menthae haplocalycis Herba (bo he)* leaves are similar in flavor and temperature to Borneolum (*bing pian*): they excel at penetrating the orifices. Their strength reaches internally to the organs, sinews, and bones, exteriorly to the pores, interstices, skin, and hair. Everywhere they vent and penetrate, thus enabling the herb to treat aching bones and sinews in warm pathogen disease. If you regard the herb as light and clear, suitable only for bringing out sweat on the skin, you are viewing it in too shallow a manner."
