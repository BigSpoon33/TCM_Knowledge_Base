## 📖 Overview

The bitterness of Forsythiae Fructus (连翘, *lian qiao*) drains fire, its coldness cools heat, and its light weight conducts pathogens outward, thereby enabling it to vent heat. Thus, it disperses heat from both the exterior and interior, particularly the Heart and upper burner. Forsythiae Fructus (连翘, *lian qiao*) is used to treat externally-contracted wind-heat or a warm pathogen disease entering the Pericardium causing irritability, fever, delirium, or rashes due to blood heat.

The twelfth-century physician Zhang Yuan-Su concisely summarized the actions of this herb in his book Pouch of Pearls: "Forsythiae Fructus (连翘, *lian qiao*) has three uses: one is to drain heat that has lodged in the Heart channel; the second is to dispel various types of heat from the upper burner; as for the third, it is the sage-like herb for sores." Basic Questions notes that "All painful, itchy sores derive from the Heart." Forsythiae Fructus (连翘, *lian qiao*) excels at clearing Heart fire and also encourages the smooth flow of qi and blood. It disperses clumped blood and the accumulation of qi, thereby reducing swellings; thus, it is used in treating toxic swollen sores, scrofula, and clumps such as swollen lymph nodes. It also facilitates urination and is used for anuria due to clumped heat, or painful urinary dribbling.

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica explains the reasoning underlying its functions:

Forsythiae Fructus (连翘, *lian qiao*) is bitter, thus [it] cools heat. Its shape is round and pointed, empty inside with a chamber very much like the heart, thus it specifically cools heat in Heart patients. These are inherent, natural characteristics, not forced or appended sophistry. Furthermore, all herbs which are light in weight and empty or soft inside must have opening, draining, disseminating, and unblocking functions, thus it can also disperse clumps while draining and transforming heat in the collateral channels.

Forsythiae Fructus (连翘, *lian qiao*) is a cooling, toxicity-resolving herb that is too often overlooked in the context of phlegm, despite its well-documented ability to disperse and penetrate, which has earned it the name of "sage-like herb for sores" (疮家圣药, *chuang jia sheng yao*). Most modern textbooks mention that it can be used for dissipating nodules, but perhaps the only modern formula which relies on its light, dispersing quality for treating hot-phlegm is Preserve Harmony Pill (保和丸, *bao he wan*). According to Materia Medica of Medicinal Properties, it also promotes urination and leads Heart fire out through the urine, which again would facilitate its ability to eliminate phlegm. Because heat resulting from obstructed qi and blood under the skin can lead to phlegm-heat and eventually toxic-phlegm as the fluids from the blood and nutritive qi are boiled away, one should consider the use of Forsythiae Fructus (连翘, *lian qiao*) in such cases, or indeed in any case of obstructed Lung heat or Heart fire affecting the fluids.
