## 📖 Overview

The cold, bitter nature of Moutan Cortex (*mu dan pi*) enables it to drain heat, while its acrid, aromatic qualities enable it to invigorate the blood, disperse stagnation, and vent lurking heat in the yin aspects of the body. The latter point is mentioned in the Grand Materia Medica, which notes that the herb "treats lurking fire in the blood level of these four channels: hand and foot lesser yin [Heart and Kidneys] and hand and foot terminal yin [Pericardium and Liver]."

The Detailed Materia Medica favorably compares this herb with others:

If there is lurking fire in the blood level, this is [due to pathology of] the ministerial fire of the Heart, Pericardium, Liver, and Kidneys. The whole world treats this with just *Anemarrhenae Rhizoma* (知母 *zhi mu*) and *Phellodendri Cortex* (黃柏 *huang bai*), and does not know that the effect of Moutan Cortex (*mu dan pi*) is even greater. However, if there is irregular gynecological bleeding or extended menstruation, it cannot be used together with herbs that promote the movement of blood.

Stating the traditional view, Li Shi-Zhen noted that the white-flowered moutan peony was thought to be tonifying, while the red-flowered was blood-invigorating. Zhang Jie Bin qualified this somewhat by observing that the mobilizing quality of the white-flowered moutan peony is more gentle than that of the red. He also explained that, regardless of the color of the flower, although it is not tonifying, its blood-invigorating property is still moderate rather than harsh. This, he said, is precisely its value: its stasis-removing effect is broad, but not so intense that it will injure the qi or the blood.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Inappropriate for those with cold in the blood, or in women who are either pregnant or have excessive menstrual bleeding when this is not due to blood heat combined with blood stasis. See Toxicity below.

With its turbid aroma, it very easily brings on nausea; those with weak stomachs will vomit as soon as they take it. It also invigorates the blood and unblocks stagnation. Thus, it is contraindicated for those with cold from deficiency of the Stomach, women with heavy bleeding or extended menses, and those who are pregnant. It cannot be used for hemorrhages due to blood heat if there is no concurrent blood stagnation. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)
