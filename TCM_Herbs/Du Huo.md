## 📖 Overview

Acrid-dispersing, bitter-drying, and warming in nature to expel pathogenic cold and promote qi and blood flow, Angelicae Pubescentis Radix (du huo) dispels wind, prevails over dampness, disperses cold, and unblocks painful obstruction. Entering the Kidney channel, which governs the interior and the lower body, Angelicae Pubescentis Radix (du huo) tracks down lurking wind and is used for painful obstruction in the feet, aching heaviness of the lower back, lurking wind headache, and swollen gums and toothache due to wind. One of the hallmarks of this herb is that it can be used for both chronic and acute disorders.

*Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances* elaborates:

Angelicae Pubescentis Radix (du huo) disseminates and unblocks the qi pathways from the vertex to the knees, and disperses lurking wind in the Kidney channel. When treating discomfort of the occiput and neck, aches and pains of the buttocks and legs, atrophy and painful obstruction of the feet which are unable to amble-without this herb [such treatment] will be ineffective.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
This substance is drying and readily injures the yin. It should be used with caution in those with yin or blood deficiency, and should not be used in patients with internal wind. See TOXICITY below.

In *Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica*, Zhang Shan-Lei emphasizes that Angelicae Pubescentis Radix (du huo), and for that matter Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qiang huo), are best suited to very cold climates like that of northern China. In warmer climates, extremely cold and damp winds are less likely to be the sole cause of headache and other pains:

Acrid and warm [qualities] are not suited to the southeast [of China], and this applies to more than seasonal disorders. Even though Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qiang huo) and Angelicae Pubescentis Radix (du huo) are excellent medicinals for wind-cold-damp pathogens, painful obstruction, and atrophy disorders, in these provinces the yin and blood are constitutionally frail, and even if people do suffer from any of these disorders, half of the cause is blood deficiency. There might be wind-cold, but it is blood deficiency that generates the wind, and qi deficiency that generates the cold. This is vastly different from the wind painful obstruction of northwest [of China], all of which is due to bandit wind and extreme cold; the nature of the disorder is simply not the same. Thus, [in more clement climates] the use of even one acrid-warm and rigorously drying herb must be attended with caution at all times.
