Commentary 
Bitter and cold, it cools heat and resolves toxicity; sweet 
and cold, it facilitates the expulsion of damp-heat. Hedyotis 
diffusae Herba (bai hua she she cao) is used for toxic accu-
mulation, whether in the upper or lower body. It combines 
strong properties for cooling heat toxin with clearing 
dampness through urination, and is thus used in the treat-
ment of swollen, sore throat, sores due to fire toxin, jaun-
dice, Intestinal abscess, dysenteric disorders, and painful 
urinary dribbling.

2 I Herbs that Clear Heat 
Guangxi Chinese Materia Medica says that it "Clears 
heat, resolves toxicity, invigorates the blood, facilitates uri-
nation. It is used in the treatment of tonsillitis, laryngitis, 
appendicitis, hepatitis, dysenteric disorder, urinary tract 
infection, and childhood nutritional impairment accumu-
lation." 
Comparisons 
::;.... Vs. SCUTELLARIAE BARBATAE H ERBA (bim zh!/idn) 
Both herbs have strong cooling and toxicity-resolving 
actions, and both promote urination. In addition, both are 
used in the treatment of various forms of cancers, especially 
those of the gastrointestinal tract. In the treatment of can-
cer they are commonly used together. However, Hedyotis 
diffusae Herba (bdi hua she she ciio) is bitter and sweet, 
with a relatively stronger ability to unblock painful urinary 
dribbling. Scutellariae barbatae Herba (bim zhl lidn), by 
contrast, is only slightly bitter, but has an acrid flavor that 
allows it to transform stagnation, break up blood stasis, 
and reduce swelling. Its effect on urination is limited to 
facilitating the smooth passage of urine in cases of urinary 
difficulty. 
Nomenclature & Preparation

herb"

ries fruit, and is free of foreign matter.
