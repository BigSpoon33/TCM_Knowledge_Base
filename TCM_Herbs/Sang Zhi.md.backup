## 📖 Overview

Bitter, neutral, yet slightly cooling, Mori Ramulus (sang zhi) enters the Liver channel. It expels wind-dampness, unblocks the channels and collaterals, and frees the movement of the joints. Mori Ramulus (sang zhi) is therefore used in the treatment of wind-damp painful obstruction disorder with numbness and spasms, as well as pain and itching in the limbs due to externally-contracted pathogenic wind.

Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica notes that "[Mori Ramulus (sang zhi)] dispels painful contraction [due to] wind qi." Essentials of the Materia Medica says that it "facilitates [movement of the] joints, nourishes the yin fluids and yang fluids, mobilizes water, and dispels wind." The Illustrated Classic of the Materia Medica has the most complete description of this medicinal's wide range of action:

[It] treats localized itching and dryness due to wind, leg qi, wind qi, contractions of the four limbs, rebellious qi, vertigo, and Lung qi cough; reduces food [stagnation], facilitates urination, and also treats dryness of the mouth.
