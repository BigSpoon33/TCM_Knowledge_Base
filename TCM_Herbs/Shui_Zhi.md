tion increases its ability to absorb acid and alleviate pain 
associated with peptic ulcers. It also makes the shells easier 
to pulverize.

shells are sprayed with vinegar to cool them. This enhances 
their ability to enter the blood level and disperse stasis and 
abdominal masses. Essentials of the Materia Medica says 
that when vinegar-calcined ark shell is "made into pills with 
vinegar, it treats all abdominal masses due to qi and blood 
[stagnation]."

Commentary 
Bitter, salty, and neutral, Hirudo (shui zhl) enters the 
blood aspect of the Liver channel. Its salty flavor enables 
its actions to move in the blood level, while its bitterness 
drains clumping. In life, a leech enjoys consuming blood, 
and is languid in movement, so that its actions are gradual, 
but stable and persistent. It mainly acts on disorders in 
the lower body. It breaks up blood, drives out stagnation, 
reduces areas of hardness, and disperses accumulation, 
and is primarily used for amenorrhea due to blood stasis, 
abdominal and uterine masses, and pain from stagnation 
due to trauma. Most often used in pills., capsules, or pow-
ders. 
The Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica 
records that it "Governs the driving-out of noxious blood, 
stagnant blood, and obstructed menses; the breaking-up of 
blood stasis accumulations and infertility; and facilitating 
the water pathways." 
Hidden Aspects of Materia Medica adds that it "treats 
fractures and injuries, facilitates the water pathways, un-
blocks menstruation, aborts pregnancy."
