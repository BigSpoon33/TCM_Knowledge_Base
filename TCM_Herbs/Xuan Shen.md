## üìñ Overview

*Scrophulariae Radix* (*xuan shen*) is sweet, bitter, salty, and cold, with a moistening nature. It enters the Lung, Stomach, and Kidney channels. Its sweet-coldness enriches the yin, its bitter-coldness drains fire and eliminates toxins, and its salty-coldness softens areas of hardness and moistens dryness. Because it is cool and moistening, it nourishes the Kidneys, controlling the fire which is floating upward. Yet it also transforms phlegm-heat. In Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, Zhang Shan-Lei describes this well:

*Scrophulariae Radix* (*xuan shen*) has a bitter and sweet flavor: bitterness can cool fire, sweetness can nourish the yin, and because of its sweet flavor, its descending nature is mild. The [Divine Husbandman's Classic of the] Materia Medica says that it only enters the Kidney channel, but [the writer] did not know that it especially enters the Lung yin organ, and can therefore resolve rootless floating fire, and disperse clumps of phlegm and generalized sores due to heat.

In Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western, Zhang Xi-Chun describes his experience with this herb:

All my life I have used it to treat postpartum heat from excess due to externally-contracted pathogenic influences; when it is severe, use White Tiger plus Ginseng Decoction (*bai hu jia ren shen tang*), except that *Scrophulariae Radix* (*xuan shen*) is substituted for *Anemarrhenae Rhizoma* (*zhi mu*). ... I am aware of the principle that cool herbs should not be used after parturition, but when an externally-contracted pathogen has indeed led to heat from excess, there is nothing that will do except to use cooling herbs to clear it. [Of all the cooling herbs, however,] only the two herbs *Gypsum fibrosum* (*shi gao*) and *Scrophulariae Radix* (*xuan shen*) are explicitly mentioned in the Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica for treating postpartum conditions; thus, I am encouraged to dare use them.

Zhang goes on to note, however, that *Ginseng Radix* (*ren shen*) must be used with *Gypsum fibrosum* (*shi gao*), and blood-tonifying herbs with *Scrophulariae Radix* (*xuan shen*), to address the underlying condition of the patient. "This is being careful while being courageous," he says.
