## 📖 Overview

Curcumae longae Rhizoma (jiang huang) has a relatively strong effect in dispelling blood stasis, as it regulates the flow of qi by driving it downward, regulates menstruation and stops pain; but various materia medica texts also note that it moves qi and disperses qi stagnation. It also expels wind and treats painful obstruction. For example, the Grand Materia Medica states that it "treats wind painful obstruction causing aching arms." Materia Medica of Combinations concurs, noting that it "treats pain due to hand and arm wind painful obstruction."

The ability of this herb to treat qi and blood stagnation is equally well-referenced. The Illustrated Classic of the Materia Medica notes that it "treats qi distention and defeated blood attacking the Heart following parturition", while the Materia Medica of Combinations says that it "breaks up blood [stasis] and drives qi downward." Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica goes somewhat further, observing that it "eliminates clumped qi distention in the epigastrium and abdomen, and pain due to cold qi and food accumulation." In this way it not only enters the blood level to invigorate the blood and dispel stasis, but also enters the qi level to disperse stagnant qi and drive it downward. These actions make it a valuable herb for gynecological disorders, and also for painful swellings due to trauma.

### Mechanisms of Selected Combinations

- **WITH CINNAMOMI RAMULUS (gui zhi)**

These herbs complement each other very well. Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui zhi) warms and unblocks the channels and collaterals, soothes spasms and contractions in the sinews, and facilitates joint movement, while Curcumae longae Rhizoma (jiang huang) breaks up blood stasis and moves the qi to treat pain in the arms. The ability of Curcumae longae Rhizoma (jiang huang) to promote the movement of blood also benefits from the yang qi-enhancing action of Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui zhi). This combination is commonly used for congealed painful obstruction in either the upper or lower limbs, but excels in the treatment of shoulder disorders, for which it serves as an excellent foundation.
