## 📖 Overview

Paeoniae Radix Rubra (chi shao) and Paeoniae Radix Alba (bai shao) were not differentiated in the earliest materia medica texts. Almost all classical texts tend to discuss their properties under the single heading of paeoniae (shao yao), while recognizing that the white and red varieties are quite distinct in the quality of their therapeutic actions (see COMPARISON below). Indeed, Tao Hong-Jing first made this differentiation in the sixth century.

Paeoniae Radix Rubra (chi shao), however, is strictly draining due to its bitterness, so that it invigorates the blood, expels stagnation, and stops pain; its slight sourness retains its affinity for the Liver so that it enters the blood aspect of the Liver, where its coldness cools heat in the blood. It is thus used for rashes due to warm pathogen disease causing heat in the blood, and swollen toxic sores, as explained in Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western: "[It] is superior for transforming stasis, thus those who treat sores and abscesses often use it for its ability to transform toxic hot blood stasis without causing the formation and perforation of pus."

Essentials of the Materia Medica notes that it specifically drains Liver fire and disperses noxious blood. It treats abdominal pain, firm accumulations, blood painful obstruction, bulging disorders, and mobile abdominal masses, amenorrhea, Intestinal wind, swollen sores, and reddened eyes-all these are the effects of dispersing and draining.
