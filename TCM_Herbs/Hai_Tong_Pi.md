5 I Herbs that Dispel Wind-Dampness 
Two different products can be distinguished: powdery 
lfng xiiin (;f;tiHL fin ling xiiin), which refers to Clematis 
sinensis, and iron lfng xiiin (ifi.lt 1.1 tie ling xiiin), which 
refers to either C. hexapetala or C. manshurica. Clematis 
sinensis is generally regarded as being of superior quality. 
}> WINE-FRIED CLEMATIS RooT 
(i@ :J:j· ffi..lt 1.1 jiu chao wei ling xian) 
The cleaned root is mixed with yellow rice wine and briefly 
left to stand, then baked or dry-fried until dry. This method 
of preparation enhances its ability to disperse cold and 
unblock the collaterals, and is used for both mobile pain-
ful obstruction disorder due to pathogenic wind, and also 
intensely painful obstruction disorder due to pathogenic 
cold. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists oflarge, thick roots with a black sur-
face and powdery cross section, with no remaining stems. 
Major known chemical constituents 
• Clematis chinensis: 
Saponines: CP2, CP2b, CP3 , CP4, CP7, CP9 (sapogenin: oleanolic 
acid); 
CP1, CP3b, CP5 , CP6 , CP8 , CP10 (sapogenin: hederagenin) 
Lactones: protoanemonin (anemonol), anemonin 
Other constituents: steroles, sugars, phenolic compounds, amino 
acids 
· Clematis hexapetala: 
Volatile oil: 3-hydroxy-4·methoxyl benzaldehyde, trans-anethole, 
2·hydroxy-4-methyl acetophenone, 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene, hep-
tadecane, heptadecane 
Lactones: anemonin 
Organic acids: palmitic acid, caproic acid, myristic acid, y-linoleic 
acid, 
8-linoleic acid, oleic acid, pelargonic acid 
• Clematis manshurica: 
Saponins: clematoside A, A', B, C

The original plant used as wei lfng xian, described in older sources 
between the Tang and Ming dynasties, was Veronicastrum sibiri-
cum (.:l!i-~Jl\i!BL cao ben wei lfng xian) of the Scrophulariaceae 
family. It is still used in north, northeast, and northwest China 
under the name fiTiUl•) zhan 16ng pan, or the alternate name ~.:l!i­

Adulterants 
Podophyllum emodii var. chinense, Sinopodophyl/um emodii ( ~ 
f3 
guT jiu): This is a very dangerous-because highly toxic-adulter-
ant. It is very similar in shape to Clematidis Radix, with a greyish 
brown to brown surface. Its cross section is white, with a yellow 
xylem part in the center. Precise microscopical and chemical iden-
tification of the herb is necessary; differentiation based solely on 
morphologhical criteria is insufficient and dangerous. 
Smilax scobinicaulis (M~M.~ duan geng ba qia), Smilax sieboldii 
(~.ilt.M.~ hua dong bii qia): These are irregularly formed rhi-
zomes. The remaining stem parts are covered with small thorns. 
The roots are long (20-80cm) and thin (0.1-0.3cm in diameter), 
with thorn-like scars of hairy roots.

Actions & Indications 
• Dispels wind-dampness, unblocks the channels and collat-
erals: for wind-damp painful obstruction, especially where 
there is soreness and pain in the lower back and knees, or 
spasms of the extremities. This herb can be used for pat-
terns of either hot or cold, depending on the other herbs 
with which it is combined. 
-
With Achyranthis bidentatae Radix (niu xl) and Noto-
pterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qiang huo) for chronic joint 
pain from wind-cold-dampness, especially of the lower 
back and knees. 
-
With Dioscoreae hypoglaucae Rhizoma (bl xie) and 
Akebiae Caulis (mil tong) for downward pouring of damp-
heat with sensations of heat and pain in the knees and 
legs. 
-
With Tinosporae sinensis Caul is (kuan fin teng) and 
Cinnamomi Ramulus (gul zhl) as an external wash for joint 
pain and spasms and contraction of the muscles due to 
either trauma or wind-cold-dampness. In most cases, daily 
treatment for at least a month is required. 
- With Cinnamomi Ramulus (gul zhl) as an external wash 
for pain and swelling of the joints. 
• Promotes urination and reduces edema: for superficial 
edema due to dampness. 
• Treats itching skin lesions: used topically for scabies and 
other skin lesions. 
- With Cnidii Fructus (she chuang zi), usually as a topi-
cally applied oil, for scabies and other itching skin lesions. 
• Also used as a gargle for toothache due to dental caries. 
Commentary 
Bitter, neutral, and downward-directing, Erythrinae Cortex 
(hai tong pi) enters the Liver, Spleen, and Kidney channels. 
Taken internally, it expels wind and unblocks the collater-
als and is excellent for alleviating lower body pain associ-
ated with wind-damp painful obstruction, leg qi, and gout. 
Applied externally, it transforms dampness, treats skin 
disorders such as scabies, as well as toothache from den-
tal caries. Clinically, it is most appropriate for symptoms 
associated with hot painful obstruction, or damp-heat in 
the lower burner, such as burning pain of the lower back, 
knees, and legs generally. It is also used in the treatment 
of damp-heat diarrhea and dysenteric disorder, as noted 
in the early text Materia Medica of the Kaibao Era: "Treats 
noxious attacks [resulting] in sudden turmoil disorder; red, 
white, and chronic dysenteric disorder." 
Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica notes that 
"Erythrinae Cortex (hai tong pi) enters the blood level of 
the Liver channel, expels wind, eliminates dampness, and 
mobilizes the channels and collaterals in order to reach the 
locus of the illness." 
Comparisons 
;;;... Vs. XANTHII FRUCTUS (ci'lng er zi) 
Both herbs expel wind, eliminate dampness, and treat 
conditions due to wind-dampness, whether it is painful 
obstruction of the joints, skin disorders, or toothache. Both 
herbs are very good for alleviating pain and itching. 
Erythrinae Cortex (hai tong pi), however, is more cool-
ing and excels at eliminating dampness. It is thus more 
appropriate for hot painful obstruction disorder, or damp-
heat lodged in the lower body leading to burning pain in the 
lower back or legs. By contrast, Xanthii Fructus (cang er z[) 
is warm, and dispels wind more than dampness, while also 
inducing sweating, releasing the exterior, and unblocking 
the nose. It is more appropriate for cold painful obstruction 
disorder, and for externally-contracted wind-cold leading 
to headache, blocked nose, and sinusitis. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Inappropriate for use in lower back pain that is not due 
to wind-dampness." (Commentary on the Divine Husband-
man's Classic of Materia Medica) 
"Forbidden in those with lack of blood or accumulated 
fire." (Materia Medica of Combinations) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
One characteristic of the plants used for this herb are the 
thorn-like protuberances in the bark itself, hence the name 
puncture erythrina bark ( A"l11 {M J.t d tong pi). 
At present there is no standardization for identifica-
tion of this herb in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. While 
Erythrinae Cortex (hai tong pi) is common throughout 
much of China, Zanthoxyli Cortex is identified as hai tong 
pi in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu; Kalopanacis Cortex 
is used as this herb in Sichuan; and Bombacis malabarici 
Cortex throughout southern China, including Hong Kong. 
Because the materia medica texts list Erythrinae Cortex as 
hai tong p£, we have treated it as the primary herb, and the 
others as adulterants. However, because these "adulter-
