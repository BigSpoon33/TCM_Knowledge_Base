## üìñ Overview

Cinnamomi Ramulus ranks with Ginseng Radix (ren shen) as the subject of the most learned discussions in the Chinese medical literature. This is because of its place as the chief herb in Cinnamon Twig Decoction (Gui Zhi Tang), the premier formula in Discussion of Cold Damage. That book demonstrates, with elegant efficiency, the various permutations of this formula, how Cinnamomi Ramulus (Gui Zhi) can be used from the upper to the lower body, and from the exterior to the interior. In Discussion of Cold Damage, and its companion text, Essentials from the Golden Cabinet, Cinnamomi Ramulus (Gui Zhi) is cited one-hundred-thirty times in seventy-seven different formulas.

An essential point in understanding Cinnamomi Ramulus (Gui Zhi) is to realize that it does not induce sweating in exterior-releasing formulas; it releases the muscle layer. The distinction between inducing sweating and releasing the muscle layer is one of depth and affiliation. The Lungs govern the skin and pertain to mobilizing protection (as in the protective qi), while the Spleen governs the flesh and pertains to the supply of nutrition (the nutritive qi). The method of inducing sweating relies on the opening, dispersing actions of the herbs themselves, as with Ephedrae Herba (ma huang), to vent and drive the pathogen outward through the pores of the skin to exit the body. Inducing sweating is the approach used when cold has constrained the most superficial level of the exterior.

Releasing the muscle layer, on the other hand, should be used when the pathogen is not constrained in the skin, but is slightly deeper. Usually the pathogen is wind, which is faster than cold at penetrating the exterior. The skin is not blocked, so sweating may already be present, and what is required to eliminate the pathogen is a more gentle suffusion of normal qi, the harmonized nutritive and protective qi, which escorts the pathogen outward through the exterior. In this- the outward-releasing of the pathogen- the two methods are similar, but the different mechanisms of action should not be confused.

This is how Li Shi-Zhen described it in the Grand Materia Medica:

Ephedrae Herba (ma huang) thoroughly unblocks the skin and pores and thus specializes in inducing sweating to disperse the cold pathogen: the Lungs focus on the skin and acridity travels through the Lungs. Cinnamomi Ramulus (Gui Zhi) penetrates and reaches the nutritive and protective levels. Thus it releases the muscle layer and the wind pathogen is expelled: the Spleen focuses on the nutritive level, the Lungs on the protective level; sweetness mobilizes the Spleen, acridity the Lungs.

Zhang Xi-Chun elaborates:

Cinnamomi Ramulus (Gui Zhi) is neither sweat-inducing nor sweat-reducing. Its power to unblock, disseminate, and spread in the exterior is in fact exercised between the exterior and the interior. ... Its flavor is both acrid and sweet: acridity can disperse, sweetness can tonify, so its effect and use is half-dispersing and half-tonifying.

Sweetness, of course, is also the flavor associated with earth, which draws Cinnamomi Ramulus (Gui Zhi) to the level of the muscles and flesh.

The actions of this herb are manifold. In Commentary on the Classic of Materia Medica, Zou Shu says of Cinnamomi Ramulus (Gui Zhi): "In general, it has six routes in therapy: harmonizing the nutritive, unblocking the yang, promoting urination, directing qi downward, promoting movement in areas of stagnation, and tonifying the middle." The Changsha Explanation of Medicines is even more explicit: Cinnamomi Ramulus (Gui Zhi) "raises the clear yang when it collapses and sinks, directs the turbid yin downward when it rebels upward, relaxes the sinews in spasm, and facilitates the movement of joints when clogged and blocked."

The Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica quotes Li Gao in emphasizing the affiliation of Cinnamomi Ramulus (Gui Zhi) with the upper limbs: "Cinnamomi Ramulus (Gui Zhi) travels transversely through the arms, because it is a twig."

One of the least recognized actions of this herb in the West is its efficacy in preventing turbid yin from gushing upward. Zhang Zhong-Jing prescribed it for this purpose in such formulas as Cinnamon Twig Decoction plus Cinnamon (Gui Zhi Jia Gui Tang), and as a single-herb addition, as in Stephania and Astragalus Decoction (Fang Ji Huang Qi Tang).

An example of how the scope of this herb has been expanded by contemporary practitioners is reflected in the experience of the modern physician Zhu Liang-Chun. He uses a large dose of Cinnamomi Ramulus (Gui Zhi)- starting with 10g, and working up to 30g, if necessary- along with Astragali Radix (huang qi), Salviae miltiorrhizae Radix (dan shen), and Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata (zhi gan cao), to treat problems such as a lower than normal heart rate along with palpitations, as in sick sinus syndrome. This draws on the ability of Cinnamomi Ramulus (Gui Zhi) to both unblock the Heart yang as well as keep the turbid yin from rebelling upward.

    - With Paeoniae Radix alba (bai shao) for externally contracted wind-cold that presents as a disharmony of the nutritive and protective qi with fever, chills, and sweating. This combination can also be used for warming and torrifying the middle burner, as in Cinnamon Twig Decoction (Gui Zhi Tang) and Minor Construct the Middle Decoction (Xiao Jian Zhong Tang).
    - With Ephedrae Herba (ma huang) for externally-contracted wind-cold marked by severe chills, fever, and lack of sweating, as in Ephedra Decoction (Ma Huang Tang).
‚Ä¢ Warms and unblocks the channels and collaterals: for wind-cold-damp painful obstruction.
- With Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi) for chills and painful extremities in cases of yang deficiency with painful obstruction, as in Cinnamon Twig and Aconite Accessory Root Decoction (Gui Zhi Fu Zi Tang).
    - With Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chuan xiong) to expel wind-dampness, warm the channels and collaterals, facilitate joint movement, and relieve the discomfort of painful obstruction.
    - With Stephaniae tetrandrae Radix (Han Fang Ji) for painful obstruction resulting from invasion of pathogenic wind, cold, and dampness into the channels and collaterals.
‚Ä¢ Warms the yang and transforms thin mucus: for lack of transformation of fluids due to yang deficiency with such symptoms as edema with urinary dysfunction or dizziness and palpitations, as in Five-Ingredient Powder with Poria (Wu Ling San) and Cinnamon Twig, White Atractylodes, and Licorice Decoction (Ling Gui Zhu Gan Tang).
    - With Ostreae Concha (mu li) and Fossilia Ossis Mastodi (long gu) for irritability and insomnia due to floating yang in the upper burner and injured yin in the lower burner as a result of Heart yang deficiency, as in Cinnamon Twig, Licorice, Dragon Bone, and Oyster Shell Decoction (Gui Zhi Gan Cao Long Gu Mu Li Tang).
    - Add Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu), Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jiang), Jujubae Fructus (da zao), and Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cao) for spermatorrhea due to exhaustion.

    - With Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata (zhi gan cao) for palpitations and shortness of breath due to listless chest yang.

    - With Salviae miltiorrhizae Radix (dan shen) for palpitations and chest pain caused by Heart yang deficiency and subsequent painful obstruction due to blood stasis blocking the channels.
‚Ä¢ Warms the channels, vessels, and collaterals: removes painful obstruction and warms the blood vessels to remove stagnation and regulate the menses, as in Warm the Menses Decoction (Wen Jing Tang) and Cinnamon Twig and Poria Pill (Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan).
    - With Persicae Semen (tao ren) and Moutan Cortex (mu dan pi) for either trauma-induced pain or gynecological discomfort due to blood stasis.
