## 📖 Overview

Bitter and cold, with downward-directing actions, Polygoni avicularis Herba (bian xu) is best for clearing heat and facilitating the removal of dampness. It can clear damp-heat from the Bladder, thereby promoting urination and unblocking painful urinary dribbling, while also clearing damp-heat so as to resolve the heat toxin. Thus, apart from treating painful urinary dribbling due to damp-heat, it is often used for damp-heat jaundice, dysenteric disorders due to damp-heat, and damp-heat sores and itchy rashes.

The Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica notes that this herb "primarily treats pruritic weeping rashes, itchy sores, and hemorrhoids, and kills the three parasites." In Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica, Zhang Lu observes that it "promotes urination and disperses damp-heat, treating jaundice, sudden turmoil disorder, and vaginal erosion." The Divine Husbandman [states that it] primarily treats pruritic weeping rashes, itchy sores, and hemorrhoids, all of which are damp-heat disorders. The three parasites, too, are transformed from damp-heat.
