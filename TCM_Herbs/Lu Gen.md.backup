## 📖 Overview

Its primary functions are to cool Lung heat, eliminate phlegm, and expel pus, but it also cools the Stomach, generates fluids, and alleviates nausea. It is not greasy in nature, and does not have the effect of retaining pathogens within the body.

The *Grand Materia Medica* recites its major indications:

Wasting and thirsting with visitant heat (消渴热, *xiao ke re*), alleviates frequent urination, treats upset Stomach causing nausea and rebelliousness that prevents food intake, heat in the Stomach, and internal heat due to cold damage. It also resolves high fever, opens the Stomach, treats dysphagia and continuous dry retching, stifling irritability due to cold or hot seasonal disorders, thirst due to diarrhea or dysenteric disorder, and Heart heat during pregnancy.

*Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica* has an interesting discussion of the role of this herb in the treatment of urinary frequency due to compelling fire preventing the descent of Lung qi:

There is nothing unusual about its functions, which are simply to clear the Lungs and direct fire downward.

Whenever there is heat in the chest, fire ascends, causing vomiting; when rebellious qi refuses to descend, Spleen and Lung heat arise, causing wasting and thirsting with urinary frequency, which can even be unendurable.

Wang Ang elaborates on this mechanism:

The Lungs are the upper source of water. The Spleen distributes essence, which ascends and enters the Lungs. Only then can the Lungs unblock and regulate the fluid metabolism and transport to the Bladder. Kidneys are the water organ and control the two excretions. When the three channels have heat, urination will be frequent, and even a small amount cannot be withheld. This is because urgency is fire's nature. Phragmitis Rhizoma (*lu gen*) is hollow inside, thus it enters the Heart and Lungs to cool upper burner heat. When this heat is released, then the Lungs can transform and promote movement so that urination returns to normal.
