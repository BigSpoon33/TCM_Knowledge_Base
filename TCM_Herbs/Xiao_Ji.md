Actions & Indications 
• Cools the blood and stops bleeding: for any kind of bleed-

-
With Imperatae Rhizoma (bai mao gen) for blood in the 
urine due to heat.

The fresh root can be used with fresh Imperatae Rhi-
zoma (xian bai mao gen) and fresh Nelumbinis Nodus rhi-
zomatis (xian au jie) for blood-streaked sputum with heat 
from deficiency. This is called Three Fresh Drink (san xian 
y!n) by Zhang Xi-Chun (d. 1930). 
• Resolves toxicity and reduces abscesses: for sores and 
abscesses due to heat toxin. Used both internally and topi-
cally. 
• Recently used for damp-heat jaundice, hepatitis, and hy-
pertension. 
Commentary 
Sweet and cool, Cirsii Herba (xiiio j!) enters the Heart and 
Liver channels to cool the blood and stop bleeding. Its 
actions are somewhat weaker than those of Cirsii japonici 
Herba sive Radix (da j!), and it has very little sore-reduc-
ing effect. However, because it is better able to promote 
urination, Cirsii Herba (xiiio jl) is especially indicated for 
heat or damp-heat causing blood in the urine. Cirsii Herba 
(xiiio jl), like Cirsii japonici Herba sive Radix (da jl), also 
promotes the function of the Gallbladder and reduces 
hypertension. 
In Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing-
Cheng has this to say about the herb: 
It breaks up blood [stasis], promotes movement in stag-
nation, enters the Heart and Liver, and is bitter, cold, 
and without toxicity. Unblocking, it treats turbid painful 
urinary dribbling, it travels the greater yang [channel] to 
separate [the clear from the turbid] and facilitates [urina-
tion]-
the actions of Cirsii Herba (xiilo jl) specifically 
break up blood [stasis] and treat painful urinary dribbling; 
it is a herb of the Heart, Small Intestine, and Bladder.
