## 📖 Overview

Bitter, cold, and aromatic, Bovis Calculus (*niu huang*) enters the Liver channel to cool the Liver, extinguish wind, and settle convulsions and jitteriness. It enters the Heart channel to clear the Heart, open the orifices, and dislodge phlegm, while also cooling the blood and resolving toxicity. Its powerful cooling quality resolves toxicity and clears heat, while its aromatic property dislodges phlegm and opens the orifices.

Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica explains that it

enters the leg terminal yin and lesser yang, and the arm lesser yin channels [Liver, Gallbladder, and Heart]. It governs childhood convulsions with chills and fever, high fever with inability to open the mouth, and adult withdrawal mania and seizures-these are all disorders of pathogenic heat congealing phlegm in the Liver and Heart channels. If the Heart is hot, fire generates a blaze; if the Liver is hot, wood generates wind; the mutual contention of fire and wind ends with the symptoms described above. The flavor of this medicinal is bitter, and its quality is cooling; entering both channels it can eliminate heat and reduce phlegm so that wind-fire is extinguished, the consciousness is cleared, and all disorders are cured.

Several materia medica texts warn that Bovis Calculus (*niu huang*) should only be used for wind-stroke if the yin organs are struck, with such symptoms as coma or delirium with overabundance of phlegm congestion. If the condition is wind-stroke in the channels or the collaterals, with such symptoms as facial paralysis, numbness of the skin, or partial paralysis of the limbs, these texts warn that it should not be used, as it could guide the pathogen deeper into the body. See TRADITIONAL CONTRAINDICATIONS below.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated during pregnancy. Should not be used for conditions that are not associated with heat from excess, nor in cases of Spleen or Stomach deficiency.
Contraindicated in those with cold from deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach, and for infants with diarrhea due to poor digestion of milk. [Li] Dong-Yuan stated: 'Bovis Calculus (*niu huang*) enters the Liver to treat the sinews; when wind-stroke enters the yin organs [themselves], it can be used to enter the bones and search out the wind. If [wind-stroke] enters the yang organs or the channels, mistaken use will conversely guide the wind into the bones, from which-like oil seeping into flour-it will be impossible to extricate it: the injury will be deep. It is particularly forbidden in those with constitutionally accumulated deficiency, who suddenly [collapse] in abandonment. [Zhang] Jing-Yue called this "false wind".' (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)

According to some traditional sources, this substance antagonizes *Fossilia Ossis Mastodi* (*long gu*), *Rehmannia Radix* (*sheng di huang*), *Gentianae Radix* (*long dan cao*), and *Dichroae Radix* (*chang shan*), and counteracts *Achyranthis bidentatae Radix* (*niu xi*).
