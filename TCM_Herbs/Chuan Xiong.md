## 📖 Overview

Chuanxiong Rhizoma (川芎 chuān xiōng) enters the Liver channel to warm and unblock the blood vessels, yet its acrid flavor and its relatively light material substance enable it to promote the movement of qi at the blood level. This also allows it to disperse qi stagnation and externally-contracted wind. In so doing, it reaches upward to the head and eyes, outward to the muscles and skin, and laterally to the joints of the limbs. The famous twelfth-century writer Zhang Yuan-Su summarized its special characteristics: "Above it moves through the head and eyes, while below, it moves through the sea of blood." The Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica exclaims:

Flavor acrid, nature yang, qi-moving and piercing with no yin-congealing, sticking, or blocking attributes—although Chuanxiong Rhizoma (川芎 chuān xiōng) enters the blood, yet it eliminates wind of all types and regulates qi of all kinds!

Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica explains its dual effect on the qi and blood, and then extends this action to pathogenic wind:

If the qi is constrained by blood, the movement of qi should be promoted to disperse the blood. If the blood is constrained by qi, the blood should be invigorated to unblock the qi. Promoting the movement of qi requires Chuanxiong Rhizoma (川芎 chuān xiōng); blood can return [to its normal circulation] and thereby is supplemented and invigorated, and the qi of the blood is thereby further assisted by Chuanxiong Rhizoma (川芎 chuān xiōng). This reaches upward to the head and eyes, and downward to the sea of blood. Its acridity is most able to disperse pathogens, so when the blood is constrained by wind, the use of Chuanxiong Rhizoma (川芎 chuān xiōng) naturally invigorates the blood, and the wind is naturally reduced.

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica states that the herb has a strong warming quality and acrid flavor, and that it

acts on the qi, with a particularly intense power to raise and discharge. It reaches upward to the head and eyes, directly venting the vertex and crown. Yet its physical substance is not solidly hard, with many empty gaps, so that it travels laterally to the joints of the limbs, linking and unblocking the channels and collaterals, penetrating through the interstices and pores to open and drain the muscles and skin.

Zhang Shan-Lei, the author of this work, proceeds to warn:

Still, we need to consider that, for disorders like headaches due to wind-heat or Liver yang attacking upward, one cannot recklessly try warm, rising, acrid-dispersing [herbs]. [Li] Dong-Yuan said that Chuanxiong Rhizoma (川芎 chuān xiōng) must be used for headaches, meaning especially wind-cold headaches, but his language is too unspecific. It has been taken up by vulgar books such as Ode of Medicinal Properties [for Four Hundred Herbs], which has the single sentence '[for] headaches, use Chuanxiong Rhizoma (川芎 chuān xiōng)', a general treatment for all headaches! What reply can be made to the damage this has caused?

As shown above, when combined with other appropriate herbs, this herb can be used for headaches from a variety of causes.
