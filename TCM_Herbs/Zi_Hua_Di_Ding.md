2 I Herbs that Clear Heat 
buncles. It can be taken internally or applied externally, and 
lives up to [its description in the classics]. It is especially 
and particularly effective for breast abscess and sores on the 
breast when they are hard, red swellings. If fresh, grind into 
juice and drink warm; if dried, decoct to drink. Taraxaci 
Herba (pu gong y!ng) can be used alone to treat this condi-
tion, but if a larger prescription is selected, this must be one 
of the included herbs. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
)> WITH PRUNELLAE SPICA (xia kii cao) 
Both herbs are bitter, cold, and clear heat, and both are leg 
terminal yin Liver channel herbs. While Taraxaci Herba 
(pu gong yzng) is also sweet and especially strong for clear-
ing heat and resolving toxicity, Prunellae Spica (xia kii cao) 
is also acrid and thus excels at dredging and unblocking 
constraint and stasis. The two herbs complement well for 
the treatment of swollen, sore throat, red, swollen eyes, or 
deep-rooted sores. However, the pair is particularly effec-
tive for the early stages of breast abscess, for which both 
internal administration and external application can be 
utilized. They can likewise be used together in the treat-
ment of such biomedically-defined disorders as hepatitis 
and cholecystitis.

Comparisons 
::o> Vs. VIOLAE HERBA (zi huii dt dzng) 
Both herbs cool heat, resolve toxicity, reduce swelling, 
and disperse clumping. Yet Taraxaci Herb a (pu gong yfng) 
is sweet as well as bitter and cold, and tends to enter the 
qi level, with a stronger ability to dredge constraint and 
disperse clumping. Its focus is directed more toward the 
Liver and Stomach channels. By contrast, Violae Herba (zi 
huii d! d!ng) is acrid as well as bitter and cold, and tends to 
enter the blood level. Thus, its ability to cool the blood and 
resolve toxicity is stronger. Its focus is on the Heart and 
Liver channels.

Toxicity 
Administration of a large dosage may cause mild diarrhea. 
Allergic reactions have also been reported with pruritus, 
sensations of heat, urticaria, nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
discomfort, and mild diarrhea. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Because of its yellow flower with a round head and long 
stem like a nail, it is also called yellow-flower earth spike 
( Yi. 1Ui!!. T huang huii d! dzng). 
::o> FRESH DANDELION (.~f i\(H~<* xiiin pu gong yzng) 
The freshly collected herb only requires that it be washed 
before using. The power of the fresh herb to cool and 
resolve toxicity is stronger than that of the dried form, and 
has a wider scope of action: swollen, toxic sores, swollen 
ears, redness, swelling, and pain of the eyes, and many 
other symptoms associated with heat toxin. It can be taken 
internally or applied externally, or both simultaneously, 
which is highly effective. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of plants with many greyish green 
leaves and thick roots.

taraxasterol, choline, inulin, pectin, volatile oil

Commentary 
Violae Herba (zi hua dl dzng) is bitter and thus able to 
drain; acrid and thus able to disperse stagnation; cold and 
thus able to clear heat and resolve toxicity. It enters the 
Heart and Liver blood level to cool the blood and reduce 
swelling. While it is most valued for treating deep-set toxic 
sores, it can be used generally to treat any red, swollen, and 
painful sore due to blood heat and accumulated stagna-
tion. 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica says that 
"Violae Herba (zi hua dl dzng) is a widely-used herb specific 
for the treatment of swollen abscesses and deep-set toxic 
sores." The Grand Materia Medica says that Violae Herba 
(zi hua dl dzng) can be used in treating all types of toxic 
sores, those occurring on the head and back, non-specific 
toxic swellings, and scrofula. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
::o-- WITH T ARAXACI HERBA (pu gong yzng) 
The main indications for this combination are toxic accu-
mulations due to heat in the blood, leading to red, swollen, 
hot painful sores. It is also effective for painful urinary drib-
bling. As noted below, these two herbs have similar actions 
but somewhat different scopes of treatment; thus, when 
combined, their application is very broad. 
Comparisons 
::;;... V S. T ARAXACI HERBA (pu gong yzng) 
Both herbs are bitter, cold, and resolve toxicity, and both 
are commonly used to treat yang-type sores and toxic 
swellings. They are often combined for these purposes. The 
differences between them are that Taraxaci Herba (pu gong 
yzng) is sweet as well as bitter, and excels at directing down-
ward and dispersing stagnant qi. It is particularly effective 
in the treatment of breast abscess. By contrast, Violae 
Herba (zi hua dl dzng) is acrid as well as bitter, and cools the 
blood. It excels at resolving toxicity, and is thus more effec-
tive than Taraxaci Herba (pu gongyzng) in treating deep-set 
toxic sores and carbuncles; it also assists in the treatment 
of snakebite. Here is how Zhang Bing-Cheng compares the 
two herbs in Convenient Reader of Materia Medica: 
Its nature, flavor, and main indications are similar to those 
ofTaraxaci Herba (pu gongyrng), but only Violae Herba 
(zi huii dl ding) can enter the blood level of the arm and leg 
terminal yin channels, promoting [the removal of] stasis 
and invigorating the blood. It is a slight difference, but this 
is the reason that Violae Herba (zz huii dl ding) treats deep-
set sores and toxic accumulation.
