• Moderates and harmonizes the characteristics of other 
herbs: by virtue of its sweet, neutral, and moderating 
properties, this herb moderates hot and cold herbs, and 
mitigates the harsh properties of other herbs. Because it is 
said to enter all twleve primary channels, it can lead and 
conduct other herbs into the channels. It is often used to 
moderate such combinations as Aconiti Radix lateralis 
preparata (zhl fu zi) and Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jiang); 
Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma 
(zhz mu); and Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da huang) and Natrii 
Sulfas (mdng xiao). 
Commentary 
Sweet and harmonious, Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cao) en-
ters all the twelve channels via the Heart, Lung, Spleen and 
Stomach channels. Its therapeutic actions differ substan-
tially depending on whether it is used in its prepared or 
unprepared form. Unprepared, it drains fire and resolves 
toxicity; prepared, it tonifies the qi of the Spleen and Heart. 
Yet, as several texts observe, even though it drains fire, this 
is not a bitter-cold type of draining, but rather a modera-
tion of fire's intensity by virtue of its sweet flavor. Its pri-
mary actions are to tonify the Spleen and augment the qi, 
moisten the Lungs and stop coughs, moderate acuteness or 
urgency (such as acute pain), and moderate the nature of 
other herbs with which it is used. Entering all twelve chan-
nels has two implications: it can guide the actions of other 
herbs into channels which they would not normally affect, 
and its own actions reach throughout the body, although 
they are strongest in the organs with which it is most closely 
associated: Heart, Lungs, Spleen, and Stomach. 
Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances 
notes: 
Used unprepared, it is cooling and drains fire: it primar-
ily disperses pathogens in the exterior, reduces swollen 
sores, eases sore throat, resolves the toxicity of all herbs, 
eliminates accumulated fire in the Stomach, dispels urinary 
tract pain- this is the power of sweet coolness eliminating 
heat. Used prepared, it is warming and tonifies the middle: 
it governs diarrhea due to Spleen deficiency, thirst due 
to Stomach deficiency, cough due to either heat or cold, 
shortness of breath, lassitude, consumption, deficiency, or 
[internal] injury-this is the power of sweet warmth rein-
forcing the Spleen. 
Records of Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica 
observes that it 
is yellow in the middle, with a reddish bark, certainly an 
herb of the Spleen and Heart channels. However, the five 
yin organs and the six yang organs each receives qi from 
the Spleen, while the Heart is the ruler of the entire body. 
The flavor of Glycyrrhizae Radix (giin cao) is the ultimate 
in sweetness, and its nature is supremely harmonious; 
thus from the Spleen and Heart it involves all the other 
yin and yang organs, reaching everywhere, expelling every 
pathogen. Its effects are completely due to its sweetness, by 
which it tonifies, by which it moderates. Whenever the sage 
[Zhang] Zhong-Jing prescribed it in formulas, he used it 
in its prepared form to tonify or moderate urgency, but in 
its unprepared form to drain fire-yet even this 'draining' 
involved the idea of moderation.

Traditional Contraindications 
Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cao) is not to be combined with 
Euphorbiae pekinensis Radix (j!ng da ji), Kansui Radix 
(gan sui), Genkwa Flos (yuan hua), and Sargassum (hai 
zao). However, many of these prohibitions are not taken 
too seriously now, and for over two-hundred years this 
herb has often been combined with Sargassum (hai zao). 
Sweet, such that it causes fullness of the middle. If mistak-
enly used in those with dampness, it will make them swol-
len and distended. It should be especially avoided by those 
with disorders involving damp swelling, distention and 
fullness, as well as those who are frequently nauseous and 
those who frequently drink wine. (Harm and Benefit in the 
Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
Long-term use may cause such side effects as salt retention, 
hypertension, spasms and numbness, dizziness, and head-
ache. It is therefore inappropriate for patients with edema, 
hypertension, hypokalemia, or congestive heart failure. 
Allergic reactions have also been reported, manifesting as 
urticaria-like drug eruptions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
induction of allergic asthma, and anaphylactic shock. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "sweet herb" 
Because it is without a doubt the most commonly used 
Chinese herb, with a moderating, harmonious nature that 
mitigates the harsh actions of other herbs, it is very much 
like a wise elder statesman, and is thus also known as the 
national elder(~ :t guo lao). Without further preparation 
it is known as unprepared licorice ( .1.. it 1f- sheng giin cao) 
or simply unprepared herb ( .1..1f- sheng cao). 
~ DRY-FRIED LICORICE (:!:}it 1f- chao giin cao) 
The sliced herb is dry-fried together with bran until dark 
yellow; alternatively, it can be sprayed with water before 
frying or baking at a moderate temperature until dark 
yellow. This method of preparation is also known as clear-
fried licorice Ot:k.:!-·it 1f- qzng chao gan cao) or clear-pre-
pared licorice (~t 9(. it 1f- q!ng zhl giin cao). Both methods 
of preparation enhance its warming property, but dry-fry-
ing with bran boosts its ability to harmonize the Stomach. 
::;.... HONEY-PREPARED LICORICE(~ 9(_ it 1f- mi zhi gan cao) 
Honey is slowly brought to a boil, and the froth and any 
residual wax or extraneous matter is scraped from the 
surface. The honey is then poured through a filter. It is 
returned to the wok, and again brought to a boil, which is 
maintained at 116-ll8°C until the whole wok bubbles and 
the honey no longer stretches between the fingers. 
Boiling water is then added to thin the honey, which 
is poured slowly over the licorice slices and briefly left 
covered. The slices are then dry-fried at a low temperature 
until deep yellow and no longer sticky to the touch. This 
is also known as prepared licorice ( 9(_ it 1f- zhi giin cao) 
or simply prepared herb (9(.1f- zhi cao). It is this method 
of preparation that is referred to with the pharmaceutical 
name Glycyrrhizae Radix preparata ( zhi gan cao) 
This method of preparation significantly increases its 
ability to tonify the middle, augment the Heart and Spleen 
qi, and harmonize the properties of other herbs. As such, it 
is a component of many classical formulas. 
);>- LICORICE TIPS (it 1f-*jlj giin cao shiio) 
These are the root tips or thin licorice rootlets, also known 
as unprepared herb tips ( .1..1f-*jlj sheng cao shao) or herb 
tips (:f*jlj cao shiio). Rather cooling in nature, the tips 
drain fire and resolve toxicity, and excel in the treatment of 
damp-heat pouring downward into the Bladder and caus-
ing urethral pain. This method of preparation is specified in 
the formula Guide Out the Red Powder (dao chi san). 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality has thin and tight, reddish brown cork, a 
solid and heavy cortex, and a yellowish white and powdery 
surface on cross section. Roots with a rough, greyish brown 
surface, loose texture, and a dark yellow surface on cross 
section are of inferior quality. Brownish black roots with a 
yellowish brown surface on cross section and a bitter taste 
should not be used. The peeled product is considered to be 
of better quality.
