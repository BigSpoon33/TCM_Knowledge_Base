## üìñ Overview

Bitter, acrid, warm, and drying, Magnoliae officinalis Cortex (hou po) enters the Lungs, Large Intestine, Spleen, and Stomach channels. It promotes the flow of qi, directing it downward to calm wheezing, disperse sensations of fullness, warm the middle, and dry dampness. When the dampness and fullness have been eliminated, the Lung qi will descend smoothly to facilitate breathing, and the wheezing will simply cease.

A special characteristic of this herb is that, while it disperses the formless stagnation of cold-damp qi, it also reduces problems with form such as food blockage and stopped-up phlegm. Thus it can be used to treat food stagnation and qi stasis, which causes distending pain in the chest and abdomen and dry clumped stools; dampness stagnating and disrupting the digestion, leading to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and dysentery; and phlegm and thin mucus that obstructs the Lungs and thereby prevents its qi from descending, leading to cough and wheezing.

Li Gao observed that the bitterness of this herb "drives qi downward, thus draining fullness due to excess; [its] warmth augments qi, thus dispersing fullness due to dampness." Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica elaborates:

Magnoliae officinalis Cortex (hou po) is a herb that eases the middle burner, transforms stagnation, and calms Stomach qi. Whenever qi stagnates in the middle, becoming constrained and unable to disperse, or food accumulates in the Stomach, delayed in its movement, or dampness becomes constrained, accumulated and unable to depart ... use the warmth of Magnoliae officinalis Cortex (hou po) to dry dampness ... and its bitterness to direct qi downward.
