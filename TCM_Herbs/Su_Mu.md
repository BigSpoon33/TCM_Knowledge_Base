Commentary 
Because of its salty flavor, Sappan Lignum (sii mil) enters 
the blood aspect of the Liver channel where its acrid, dis-
persing quality invigorates the blood, dispels stasis, and 
stops pain. Although generally considered neutral, several 
materia medica texts remark on its slight cooling tendency. 
It is often used for injuries from trauma, such as painful 
swollen bruises, and also treats amenorrhea and dysmen-
orrhea due to blood stasis. The Newly Revised Materia 
Medica states that it "primarily breaks up blood stasis. For 
postpartum intolerable stifling distention due to blood 
stasis, boil lSOg in water and vinegar until thickened, then 
drink -effective." 
Omissions from the Grand Materia Medica mentions 
that it can be used to treat "vomiting from sudden turmoil 
disorder, or other frequent vomiting. Take it decocted 
in water. To break up blood [stasis], it is best boiled in 
. " 
wme. 
Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi says that it "treats wom-
en's qi and blood [stasis] causing Heart or abdominal 
pain, irregular menses, and postpartum illnesses due to 
overwork (W~ ril lao). It pushes out pus, stops pain, 
eliminates swollen sores, and contusions."
