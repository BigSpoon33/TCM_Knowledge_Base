13 I Herbs that Stabilize and Bind 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
In ancient times it was called fish bone (.~, * yu gu) or 
bland fish bone (){ .~, * dim yu gu). Because the cuttlefish 
is known as the 'black thief in Chinese, the bone is fre-
quently called black thief bone(.~ J!~ * wu zei gu) or black 
thief fish bone(.~ llt"t.~, * wu zei yugu). Rather less often, it 
is also known as inkfish bone(.~.~,* rna yu gu). 
);> DRY-FRIED CUTTLEFISH BONE 
(;kj·~~*Jli chao hai piao xiao) 
The sections are dry-fried until yellow. This is also known 
as prepared cuttlefish bone (k.~~*Jli zh! hai piao xiao). 
This method of preparation reduces its fishy flavor and 
enhances its restraining, stabilizing astringency, especially 
in regard to dampness, and also its ability to reduce stom-
ach acid. It is frequently used for thin watery vaginal dis-
charge due to Spleen and Kidney deficiency, and for acid 
regurgitation due to loss of Stomach harmony. 
);> CALCINED CuTTLEFISH BoNE 
(:lff.~~*Jli duim hai piao xiao) 
Sections of cuttlefish bone are placed in a calcining con-
tainer and cooked at a high temperature until scorched and 
black. This method of preparation enables it to enter the 
blood aspect, strongly restraining and inhibiting to stop 
bleeding; it can also be used for vaginal discharge. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality is white, unfragmented, and free of foreign 
matter. 
Major known chemical constituents 
Inorganic matter (>90%): calcium carbonate 
Other constituents: keratin, mucilage, amino acids

pararadicis (fu shen), Codonopsis Radix (dang shen), and 
Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang guf) for urinary frequency 
(to the point of incontinence) in adults, or bedwetting in 
children, due to the Bladder losing its restraint, as in Mantis

-
With Cuscutae Semen (tu s! zi), Cervi Cornu pantotri-
chum (lu rong), and Cistanches Herba (rou cong rong) for 
continuous urinary dripping, exhaustion, and lower back 
pain from Kidney qi deficiency, as in Cuscuta Seed Pill (tu 
Sl Zl wan). 
Commentary 
Sweet, salty, and neutral, with an astringent nature, Manti-
dis Ootheca (siing piiio xiiio) enters the Liver and Kidney 
channels to tonify the Kidneys, reinforce the yang, and 
stabilize the lower burner. Encountering the Sources of the 
Classic of Materia Medica says that it is "a medicinal of the 
Liver, Kidneys, and gate of vitality." 
It is particularly appropriate for Kidney weakness with 
instability at the gate of essence leading to spermator-
rhea, nocturnal emissions, and impotence. Its ability to 
contain the urine derives from two aspects. First, because 
the Kidneys support the functioning of the Bladder, when 
the Kidneys are strong the Bladder will function properly. 
Second, its astringent quality secures the urinary orifice, 
and thus prevents urinary frequency and enuresis. It is sim-
ilarly used for watery vaginal discharge and cloudy urine. 
Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica 
observes: 
Its function is specifically to restrain and bind, thus it is 
often used in prescriptions for treating male deficiency and 
[internal] injury, impotence due to Kidney exhaustion, loss 
of essence during dreams, urinary incontinence, and cloudy 
urine. 
In Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing-
Cheng explains: 
Enters the blood level of the Kidney channel. Augmenting 
the Kidneys and securing the essence are its basic functions, 
which is why it is so often used for enuresis in children with 
Kidney qi insufficiency, by grinding the prepared form and 
taking it as a powder. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
)> WITH ROSAE LAEVIGATAE FRUCTUS 
(jfn y!ng zi); see page 888 
)> WITH Foss ILIA Oss1s MAsTom (long gu) 
Mantidis Ootheca (siing piiio xiiio) is salty, neutral, and 
sweet, tonifying the Liver, Kidneys, and the gate of vital-
ity while securing the essence and containing the urine. 
Fossilia Ossis Mastodi (long gu) is sweet, neutral, and 
astringent, entering the Liver, Kidneys, and Heart with a 
sticky, astringent nature that enables it to restrain and hold 
in the primal qi, thus containing loss through leakage. If 
Mantidis Ootheca (siing piiio xiiio) is used by itself in the 
treatment of Kidney deficiency leakage, it is quite strong 
for tonifying, but not strong enough to contain; conversely, 
Fossilia Ossis Mastodi (long gu) by itself can contain, but is 
unable to supplement the underlying deficiency. Together, 
however, each redresses the weakness of the other, deliver-
ing a powerful tonifying containment in a combination 
that can be used on its own in mild cases. It is appropriate 
for enuresis, urinary frequency, premature ejaculation, 
nocturnal emissions, and vaginal discharge, when due to 
Kidney yang weakness and loss of Kidney qi stability. 
Comparisons 
)> Vs. ALPINIAE OXYPHYLLAE FRUCTUS (yz zhl ren) 
Both substances warm and tonify the lower base, contain 
the urine, and secure the essence, and both are used to treat 
cold from deficiency in the lower burner leading to enure-
sis, urinary frequency, and spermatorrhea. For this reason 
the two are often combined to strengthen the Kidney yang 
and inhibit the loss of essence. 
In addition, Alpiniae oxyphyllae Fructus (yl zhl ren) 
warms the Spleen, contains the saliva, and halts diarrhea, 
while Mantidis Ootheca (siing piiio xiiio) is primarily used 
for lower burner cold from deficiency.

Traditional Contraindications 
According to some traditional sources, this herb counter-
acts Inulae Flos (xudn fu huii). 
"Those with spermatorrhea, incontinence of urine, or 
greatly overabundant fire qi should only use it in small 
amounts." (Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic 
of Materia Medica) 
"If yin-deficient people with much fire mistakenly use it, 
it will conversely lead to yang deficiency. Excessive [use] 
leads to dark urine, pain in the penis, excessive erections 
but loss of essence-one cannot be ignorant of these facts." 
(Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Several species of praying mantis egg-cases are used (see 
STANDARD SPECIES above) with sizes ranging between 2cm 
to Scm in length. After collection between autumn and the 
following spring, and removal of attached twig remnants, 
the egg-cases are washed by soaking in water, then steamed 
thoroughly for up to one hour in order to kill the inhabit-
ants. Traditional instructions for steaming recommend 
that the process be at a high enough temperature to pro-
