## 📖 Overview

Sour, binding, and neutral, the primary action of Rosae Laevigatae Fructus (jīn yīng zi) is to conserve, bind, and stabilize the lower burner. Because it enters the Large Intestine channel, it stops diarrhea due to Spleen deficiency. It also enters the Bladder and Kidney channels, where it secures the essence when deficient Kidneys fail to secure the gate of essence, leading to spermatorrhea; it contains the urine in cases of incontinence and enuresis due to loss of Bladder control; and it stops thin watery vaginal discharge due to Kidney deficiency in women.

Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica explains:

Binding can eliminate abandonment. When Spleen deficiency [causes] incessant diarrhea, it will not be stabilized without binding, astringent remedies. Cold from deficiency in the Bladder can cause incontinence of urine; the Kidneys and the Bladder interact, so that if the Kidneys are deficient, essence will slip out through the urine from time to time. This herb is warm [sic] with a sour, astringent flavor, and enters the three channels to conserve and hold in deficient abandoned qi-hence its efficacy for these disorders.

It should be borne in mind that Rosae Laevigatae Fructus (jīn yīng zi) does not tonify deficiency; it is strictly a binding herb, and should thus be combined with herbs that treat the underlying weakness in order to treat the root.

New Compilation of Materia Medica, In Chen Shi-Duo provides important clinical guidelines for the use of this medicinal:

Everyone uses Rosae Laevigatae Fructus (jīn yīng zi) for its ability to bind the essence: who among them realizes that leakage of essence cannot be stopped by simply using astringent herbs? Disorders of spermatorrhea and nocturnal emissions always involve closure of the urethral orifice at the same time as opening of the seminal orifice-one must use water-facilitating herbs to open the urethral orifice, together with flavors to bind the essence and stabilize the seminal gate, otherwise the spermatorrhea will simply worsen when binding herbs are used. Therefore, to use Rosae Laevigatae Fructus (jīn yīng zi), one must also use such herbs as Euryales Semen (qiàn shí), Dioscoreae Rhizoma (shān yào), Nelumbinis Semen (lián zi), and Coicis Semen (yì yǐ rén): by not just binding, conversely (yì yì nán): [to what may be expected] binding occurs, using binding within facilitation, using tonification to support the binding. This is the secret of medicinal use, and [shows] a truly deep knowledge of herbs.

Excessive facilitation of water is clumsy when treating spermatorrhea; one must tonify more than bind, and bind more than facilitate. After this, the essence will be sufficient and will not leak, the urethral orifice will open, and the seminal orifice will close. Rosae Laevigatae Fructus (jīn yīng zi) can only bind the essence, it cannot augment the essence, which is why the more [it is used by itself to] bind, the more leakage there will be.
