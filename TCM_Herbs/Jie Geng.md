## 📖 Overview

With an acrid flavor that disperses, and bitterness that drains, *Platycodi Radix* (jie geng) is also quite lightweight, which gives it an ascending quality. Overall, it has an ascending and dispersing nature which raises and opens the Lung qi, releases the exterior, benefits the throat, transforms phlegm, and expels pus.

Ancient writings say that "*Platycodi Radix* (jie geng) is like a boat: it lifts the other herbs upward." Thus the herb is customarily used for problems above the diaphragm. The following passage was quoted by Zhang Yuan-Su, who explained that it can be used to raise the actions of herbs that would otherwise descend-such as *Rhei Radix et Rhizoma* (da huang)-into the chest or higher: "These herbs are like iron or stone entering a river: they cannot be carried along without a boat." But Zhang cautioned that if *Platycodi Radix* (jie geng) is improperly prescribed with these herbs, it will prevent their actions from properly descending. In addition, this raising action can be used judiciously for lower burner problems, for example, as a means to treat tenesmus in dysenteric disorders, or (via the effect of the Lung qi on the water pathways, and the ascent and descent of the qi dynamic) for urinary blockage. In this regard, Zhu Dan-Xi noted:

Dysenteric disorders with abdominal pain are constraint of Lung metal qi in the Large Intestine, which [first] requires unbinding with the use of bitter *Platycodi Radix* (jie geng), and only then can herbs that are specific to dysenteric disorder be used. This herb can raise and unbind the qi and blood, and should accordingly be used with other qi herbs.

Chen Shi-Duo examined this tendency and pointed out its corollary:

It raises by nature, but why are there still some herbs which it cannot carry upward? The reason that they are not carried upward is always because of improper use of the herbs. Despite the ascending tendency of *Platycodi Radix* (jie geng), if descending herbs are used at the same time for purging or tonifying [the lower burner], this ascending tendency will attempt to manifest but fail ... they will cancel each other out, and neither will move. They will remain stuck in the middle burner, unable to rise, unable to fall.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Because of this herb's acrid, dispersing, and draining qualities, it is contraindicated for chronic cough from yin deficiency or in patients with a tendency to cough up blood.

"Should not be taken if abscess or deep sores have already perforated; it is also forbidden for pregnant women." (Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica)

It is, after all, an herb that raises, and should not be used whenever pathogenic qi rushes rebelliously upward, unable to descend, or if lower burner yin is deficient and floating, or if there is a pathogen in the lower burner. It should also not be used with herbs intended to purge or to tonify the lower burner. If used incorrectly, it will certainly cause wheezing, rebellious qi, and other changes. When there is an excess disorder in the upper burner, with no disorder in the lower burner, it should then be accompanied by *Glycyrrhizae Radix* (gan cao). (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)
