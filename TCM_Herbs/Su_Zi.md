and cooked into rice congee to moisten the Intestines and 
unblock the bowels. 
Commentary 
Aromatic, warm, acrid, and moistening, Perillae Fructus 
(zi su zi) excels at directing rebellious qi downward. This 
action disperses phlegm and calms wheezing, while moist-
ening and facilitating Intestinal movement. Rectification of 
the Meaning of Materia Medica notes that "The seeds are 
slippery and easing. They go straight down, directing qi 
downward, reducing phlegm, alleviating cough, and moist-
ening the Lungs .... Perillae Fructus (zi su zi) is appropriate 
for cold thin mucus, wheezing, and cough." It goes on to 
quote Zhen Quan to the effect that Perillae Fructus (zi su zi) 
"in the upper body treats cough, rebellious and cold qi; and 
damp qi in the lower back and feet." 
An interesting perspective on the use of this herb is 
provided by Chen Shi-Duo: 
Wheezing can be excessive or deficient; Perillae Fructus 
(zi su zi) only settles wheezing from excess. If it is used

445 
for wheezing from deficiency, it will become worse-how 
could it simply have no effect? While Perillae Fructus (zi 
sii zi) can settle wheezing from excess, it will unavoidably 
deplete the qi; if the qi is [already] depleted, it becomes 
more deficient, thus the wheezing worsens. To treat wheez-
ing from deficiency, large doses of herbs like Ginseng Radix 
(ren shen) and Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu dl huang) 
must therefore be added, but do not add Perillae Fructus 
(zisiizi). 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
);;- WITH LEPIDn/DESCURAINIAE SEMEN (tfng ll zi) 
Both herbs alleviate cough and calm wheezing. Perillae 
Fructus (zf sil zi) specifically directs rebellious qi downward 
and transforms phlegm and thin mucus, thereby alleviating 
the wheezing and cough. Lepidii/Descurainiae Semen (tfng 
ll zi) specifically drains Lung qi closure and blockage, in the 
process dissolving phlegm to calm wheezing and facilitat-
ing fluid metabolism to resolve edema. 
Together, Lepidii/Descurainiae Semen (ting ll zi) opens 
while Perillae Fructus (zf sil zi) directs rebellious qi down-
ward so that the Lung qi is freed and fluid metabolism is 
naturally unblocked and restored to orderly movement. 
The pair is most often used for Lung qi constraint and 
blockage affecting fluid circulation such that the phlegm 
and thin mucus accumulate excessively. This causes such 
symptoms as cough and wheezing which worsen when 
lying down, stifling fullness and discomfort in the chest, 
edema of the tissues of the face and head, and reduced 
urine flow. Because of the powerful action of this combi-
nation in draining the Lungs and dissolving phlegm and 
fluids, it should not be used lightly, or for everyday mild 
disorders. Its usage should cease once the desired effect is 
achieved. 
);;- WITH ARMENIACAE SEMEN (xlng ren); see page 438 
Comparisons 
);;- Vs. PERILLA£ CAuus (zi su geng) and 
PERILLA£ FouuM (zf su ye) 
All three are qi-regulating herbs. Perillae Folium (zf sil ye) 
harmonizes the middle and stops nausea while expelling 
exogenous pathogens. Perillae Caulis (zi sil geng) unbinds 
the middle burner qi and relieves obstruction in the chest 
and diaphragm. Perillae Fructus (zf sil zi) directs the 
Lung qi downward, transforms phlegm, and moistens the 
Intestines. 
Li Shi-Zhen noted that "The seeds and leaves have the 
same functions, but to disperse wind qi, use the leaves, 
while the seeds are more appropriate for clearing and facili-
tating the upper and lower [body]." 
);;- Vs. SINAPIS SEMEN (bdi jie zi); see page 424 
Traditional Contraindications 
Detailed Materia Medica cautions that "If the exterior is 
deficient, do not use the leaves; if the bowels are loose or 
the Lungs deficient, do not use the seeds." Zhang Shan-Lei 
elaborates: 
It is only that the seeds are very oily and capable of drain-
ing the true qi, so that when Encountering the Sources of the 
Classic of Materia Medica says that they should not be used 
for qi deficiency, long-term cough, yin deficiency wheezing 
and rebellious qi, and Spleen deficiency with loose stools, 
this is a most accurate assessment. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
);;- DRY-FRIED PERILLA FRUIT (~J ~~ .~ -T chao zf su zi) 
Dry-fry over moderate heat until it becomes aromatic or 
begins to pop. This greatly reduces its moistening quality so 
that its actions are concentrated on directing qi downward, 
expelling phlegm, and relieving cough and wheezing. This 
is the form that is most commonly used in the clinic, while 
the raw (untreated) fruit are only used if specifically needed 
for moistening the Intestines and treating cough. 
);;- PREPARED PERILLA FRUIT ( ~ 
~~.~ -f zhl Zl sil zi) 
The seeds are mixed with honey then fried until all of it is 
absorbed. Not only does this improve its ability to moisten 
the Lungs and Large Intestine, it also enhances its ability 
to relieve cough and wheezing, especially in yin-deficient 
patients with constipation.

high oil content and a fresh, aromatic fragrance when frag-
