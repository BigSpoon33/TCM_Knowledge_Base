Commentary 
Unprepared Farfarae Flos (kuan dong hua) is used to warm 
the Lungs and alleviate cough in the treatment of cold-
phlegm cough. Some scholars say that it is warm but not 
drying, and in fact slightly moistens the Lungs. Therefore, 
when properly combined with other herbs, it can be used 
for any type of cough: hot, cold, acute, or chronic. 
It is most appropriate for cough or wheezing with 
profuse phlegm due to pathogenic cold binding the Lungs, 
or cough due to Lung deficiency, but can also be used for 
externally-contracted warm pathogen diseases constrained 
in the Lung channel, which gives rise to cough or wheez-
ing. 
The eighteenth-century physician Chen Shi-Duo had 
some interesting things to say about this herb in compari-
son to Asteris Radix (zf wan): 
Nowadays people like to use Asteris Radix (zi wan) and 
do not use Farfarae Flos (kuan dong hua), which is puz-
ziing. Although Asteris Radix (zi wan) can alleviate chronic

cough, its flavor is bitter and it injures the Stomach. It is 
different than Farfarae Flos (kuan dong huii), the flavor of 
which is sweet, such that within its ability to eliminate is the 
ability to tonify as well. Although Farfarae Flos (kuan dong 
huii) tonifies in the course of clearing, it should still not be 
overly used, because its tonification is slight compared to 
its clearing [action]. Its tonification consists of entering the 
Heart to calm it, entering the Liver to improve the vision, 
and entering the Lungs to alleviate cough. However, while 
entering the Heart it also drains Heart fire, and overuse will 
drain this fire excessively. Small doses, on the other hand, 
will generate Stomach [qi] and strengthen food intake. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
:> WITH ASTER!$ RADIX (zi wan) 
These two herbs are commonly paired to transform phlegm 
and alleviate cough. The acrid warmth of Farfarae Flos 
(kuan dong hua) unblocks and disseminates Lung qi, 
providing a strong cough-alleviating action. Asteris Radix 
(zi wan) too is acrid, which supports the dissemination 
of Lung qi; but it is also bitter, which provides a draining 
action and shifts its primary mode of action to transform-
ing phlegm, which in turn alleviates cough. 
Together the cough-alleviating efficacy is doubled 
because of the combination of the Lung qi-disseminating 
and phlegm-transforming properties of these two herbs. 
They can be combined whenever a cough has sputum 
which is difficult to expectorate, regardless of whether the 
cough is acute or chronic, hot or cold, externally-contract-
ed or internally-generated. 
Furthermore, while neither herb is especially drying, if 
prepared with honey, this pair can even be used for cough 
from Lung consumption when there is blood in the spu-
tum, or for dry cough from Lung deficiency. 
» WrTH LrLn BuLsus (bai he) 
Farfarae Flos (kuan dong hua) is warm, moist, and directs 
the Lung qi downward with a strong cough-alleviating 
action. Lilii Bulbus (bai he) is sweet and cold, and preserves 
and moistens the Lungs. Together the two herbs are mutu-
ally supportive: Farfarae Flos (kuan dong hua) enhances 
the moistening and cough-alleviating action ofLilii Bulbus 
(bai he), which in turn moderates the warmth of Farfarae 
Flos (kuan dong hua). The pair is particularly effective for 
chronic non-productive cough from Lung yin deficiency, 
and cough with sputum tinged with blood. 
Comparisons 
:> Vs. ASTERIS RADIX (zi wan); see page 441, and the 
COMMENTARY above 
Traditional Contraindications 
From ancient times until the present, this herb has been 
important for treating cough. Because of its acrid warmth 
and ability to direct qi downward, there are no disagreeable 
effects on the Lungs, therefore it can be used safely without 
regard for hot or cold, excess or deficiency. (Harm and 
Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
No toxic reactions are noted in the literature. However, 
because the drug contains carcinogenic pyrrolizidine alka-
loids, its use is restricted in some countries. Long-term 
administration of the herb in high doses may risk causing 
liver cancer. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
» HoNEY-PREPARED TussrLAGO FLOWER 
(~ k. #J:.~1t. ml zhl kuan dong hua) 
The cleaned herb is mixed with watery honey and dry-fried 
until the honey is completely absorbed. This increases the 
Lung-moistening and cough-alleviating qualities of the 
herb, and is particularly appropriate for cough or wheezing 
due to Lung deficiency. Despite its warmth, it can still be 
used for yin deficiency cough if combined with herbs that 
nourish yin fluids. 
:> DRY-FRIED TUSSILAGO FLOWER 
(:J:;J;#J:.~1t. chao kuan dong hua) 
The herb is dry-fried or baked briefly with moderate heat. 
This mitigates its acrid-dispersing quality so that it is better 
suited for treating dry cough from qi deficiency or yin defi-
ciency. It is less effective than the honey-prepared variety, 
and therefore no longer frequently used. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of purplish red, large flower buds 
with short (Smm) stalks. Pale reddish, yellowish, or pur-
plish black flower buds are of inferior quality, and opened 
flowers with long, wooden stalks should not be used.
