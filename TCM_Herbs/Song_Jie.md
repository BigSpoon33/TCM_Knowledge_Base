5 I Herbs that Dispel Wind-Dampness 
367 
-
With Cicadae Periostracum (chan tul), Rehmanniae 
Radix (sheng dl huang), and Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang 
guf) for rash due to wind-heat. 
• Removes superficial visual obstruction: for pterygium or 
disorders of the cornea. 
-
With Cicadae Periostracum (chan tul) and Tribuli Fruc-
tus ( cl ji li) for superficial visual obstruction. 
Commentary 
Sweet, salty, and neutral, Serpentis Periostracum (she tul) 
is often used as a stand-alone herb in the treatment of skin 
lesions, seizures, and convulsions associated with patho-
genic wind, and for eye disorders such as superficial visual 
obstructions, pterygium, or corneal disorders. The Grand 
Materia Medica elaborates: 
Serpentis Periostracum (she tul) has four medicinal appli-
cations: first, it can clear away the noxious via its change-
able agility; thus it treats spirit [possession], gil toxin, and 
malarial disorders. Second, it dispels wind via its associa-
tion with the trigram~ xim [the trigram for wind] and its 
scurrying nature; thus it treats fright seizures, epilepsy, and 
all disorders of the throat and tongue. Third, it kills para-
sites; thus it treats noxious sores, hemorrhoids, rashes, and 
scabies via its poison. Fourth, its utility resides in the sig-
nificance of its sloughed skin; thus it treats superficial visual 
obstruction, parturition, and all skin disorders. The rest can 
be extrapolated. 
A passage from Extension of the Materia Medica explains 
the fourth action identified in the Grand Materia Medica 
above: "Serpentis Periostracum (she tul) is sloughed off 
from the mouth, and the eye [coverings] are also sloughed 
off. At present its use in eye medicines to dispel superficial 
visual obstruction derives from this consideration." 
Traditional Contraindications 
The Grand Materia Medica quotes Zhen Quan's view that 
Serpentis Periostracum (she tul) should not be used during 
pregnancy. While this advice is generally followed, it is not 
universally accepted. For example, Materia Medica of Ri 
Hua-Zi says that it calms the fetus in pregnancy. 
Toxicity 
Serpentis Periostracum has a very low toxicity and there are 
no reports of toxic side effects. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "snake slough" 
Some other names that refer to the same substance are 
snake skin (!ht;t she pi), dragon garment (~t~ long yl), 
and long pest skin (-& lk. ;t chang chong pi). 
Once the snake skin is obtained, it is cleaned of dirt, 
mud, or sand, then dried. Because of its objectionable 
flavor, it is rarely taken internally in its unprepared form; 
wine-prepared Serpentis Periostracum (she tul) is pre-
ferred. 
:;... WINE-PREPARED SNAKE SKIN 0@ !ht#tjiu she tul) 
Sections of the sloughed skin are soaked in yellow rice 
wine and left covered briefly until thoroughly moistened 
with the absorbed wine. They are then placed in a pot and 
dry-fried over moderate heat until slightly yellow. Not 
only does this method of preparation improve the taste, 
it enhances its ability to dispel wind. It is often used in the 
treatment of childhood convulsions, itchy skin disorders, 
and superficial visual obstruction. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality is long, clean, dry, white, and glossy, without 
adherent soil. 
Major known chemical constituents 
collagen, protein

5 I Herbs that Dispel Wind-Dampness 
CHANNEL ENTERED 
Liver 
KEY CHARACTERISTICS 
disperses wind-damp painful 
obstruction within the joints and sinews 
D OSAGE 
9-15g 
CAUTIONS & CONTRAINDICATIONS 
none noted 
Actions & Indications 
• Dispels wind, dries dampness, and stops pain: for wind-
damp painful obstruction with pain and soreness in the 
joints. Used primarily when dampness and/or cold pre-
dominate. Also for pain from traumatic injury. 
-
With Piperis kadsurae Caul is (hai feng teng), Angelicae 
pubescentis Radix (du hu6), and Mori Ramulus (siing zhl) 
for wind-damp painful obstruction. 
Commentary 
Bitter and warm, Pini Lignum nodi (song jie) enters the 
Liver channel where its bitterness dries and its warmth 
disperses wind-damp painful obstruction from the joints 
and sinews. It is therefore often used in the treatment of 
joint pain due to pathogenic wind, cold, and dampness. 
The herb can be decocted or soaked in wine for internal 
use, or the wine-prepared form can be applied topically for 
joint pain. 
The assessment of its range of application has been 
remarkably consistent over the centuries. The early Miscel-
laneous Records of Famous Physicians identified the follow-
ing indications: "Long-term wind panarthralgia, deficiency 
due to wind, and pain due to leg painful obstruction." A 
thousand years later, the Grand Materia Medica noted that 
it is "Appropriate for all disorders involving wind-damp-
ness between the sinews and bones." 
Comparisons 
~ Vs. MORI RAMULUS (siing zhl) 
Both herbs dispel wind-dampness and are often used in the 
treatment of wind-damp painful obstruction in the sinews, 
bones, and joints. Because Pini Lignum nodi (song jie) is 
warm and drying, it is appropriate in those cases where 
cold is also present (wind-cold-dampness), but not heat. By 
contrast, Mori Ramulus (sang zhf) is neutral, and is there-
fore appropriate whether the painful obstruction involves 
cold or heat. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Consumption is contraindicated for those with blood dry-
ness." (Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia 
Medica) 
"It is particularly contraindicated for those with blood defi-
ciency." (Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "pine knots" 
The large, oily, reddish-brown branch nodes, redolent of 
pine, are collected at any time of year from felled trees or 
lumber yards, cleaned, then dried in the sun. They can also 
be soaked or steamed to facilitate slicing into smaller sec-
tions, which are better for decoctions. They are also known 
as oily pine knots (irett:--nr you songjie), which refers espe-
cially to P. tabulaeformis, as that is its Chinese botanical 
name. 
The nodes are generally used raw, although there is 
this interesting note in Supplement to the Extension of the 
Materia Medica: "Dry-fried until scorched, it treats disor-
ders within the bony joints, and dries dampness within the 
blood." 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of large, reddish brown pieces with 
high oil content. 
Major known chemical constituents 
Volatile oil: a-pinene, B-pinene (together >90%), 1-camphene, 
dipentene 
Other constituents: resins
