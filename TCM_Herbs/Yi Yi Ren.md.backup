## 📖 Overview

Sweet, bland, and slightly cold, with a nature that drains and directs downward, Coicis Semen (*yi yi ren*) enters the Lung, Spleen, Stomach, and Kidney channels. The Spleen is averse to dampness and prefers dryness; excessive dampness encumbers the Spleen and impairs its transportive and transformative functions. The bland flavor of Coicis Semen (*yi yi ren*) leaches out dampness, and its sweetness augments the Spleen; thus, it both eliminates dampness and strengthens the Spleen. It is primarily used for symptoms associated with an overabundance of dampness coupled with a weak Spleen. This would include diarrhea, loss of appetite, edema, abdominal distention, leg qi edema, vaginal discharge, and urinary difficulty.

The Spleen governs the flesh and Coicis Semen (*yi yi ren*) is especially valued for its ability to eliminate pathogenic dampness from the flesh, muscles, sinews, and bones. It is commonly used to treat wind-damp painful obstruction and spasms of the sinews, especially if associated with heat. Because the Spleen is the source of generative transformation, if the Spleen and Stomach are strong, the Lung qi will be sufficient. Coicis Semen (*yi yi ren*) enters the Lung channel where it augments the Lungs, clears heat, and expels pus. It is thus useful in the treatment of Lung abscess, Lung atrophy, and Intestinal abscess.

The Grand Materia Medica observes that this is a yang brightness herb, strengthening the Spleen and augmenting the Stomach. For deficiency, tonify the mother, so it is used for Lung atrophy and Lung abscess. Disorders of the sinews and bones are addressed at the root by treating yang brightness, and thus it is used for cramps, spasms, and wind painful obstruction. Earth generates water and eliminates dampness, thus it is used for diarrhea, dysenteric disorders, and edema.

Description of the Materia Medica notes that it expels dampness, but is not as drying as either type of atractylodes; it clears heat, but does not injure the yin like *Scutellariae Radix* (*huang qin*) or *Coptidis Rhizoma* (*huang lian*); it augments the qi, but does not increase damp-heat like *Ginseng Radix* (*ren shen*) or *Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma* (*bai zhu*) - it is truly a notable herb for augmenting the middle qi!

Taken together, its harmonious nature allows it to tonify without being cloying, and to leach out dampness without harming the yin. It can be used whenever dampness results from Spleen deficiency, or when the fluid pathways are not flowing smoothly. However, in Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing-Cheng notes that while it strengthens the Spleen and augments the Stomach, its tonification is not as powerful as that of *Dioscoreae Rhizoma* (*shan yao*); cooling heat and facilitating the removal of pathogenic dampness - these are its strong points.
