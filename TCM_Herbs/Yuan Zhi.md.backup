## 📖 Overview

Acrid, bitter, and slightly warm, the nature of Polygalae Radix (yuan zhi) disseminates, drains, unblocks, and thrusts outward to assist in the free movement of the Heart qi, opens constraint, and guides the Kidney qi upward to reach the Heart, thereby re-establishing harmonious communication between the Heart and Kidneys.
- Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica says that "the actions of Polygalae Radix (yuan zhi) focus on the Heart and Kidneys", and Wang Hao-Gu says that these actions "enter the qi level of the Kidneys."
- The herb's acrid flavor disperses, while its bitter flavor drains, thereby opening the orifice of the Heart and expelling the turbid phlegm that occludes the spirit. It is thus most appropriate for symptoms of disturbed consciousness associated with phlegm blocking the Heart orifice, such as forgetfulness, palpitations, and insomnia. These qualities also make it suitable for cough due to Liver constraint, or phlegm-dampness obstructing the channels and collaterals, such as may occur with swollen and painful breasts. Polygalae Radix (yuan zhi) can be powdered and applied topically for this complaint, as well as other swellings and sores.
- Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances provides an excellent description of this herb:
- Polygalae Radix (yuan zhi) is acrid, heavy, and robust, an herb to enter the Heart, open the orifices, disseminate and disperse. Whenever phlegm lurks in the Heart, it clogs and plugs the Heart's orifice, causing heat from excess in the Heart qi and leading to confusion, mental blankness, impaired ability to speak, restless sleep, disorientation, fright, forgetfulness, disturbing dreams, and children who remain upset after seeing strangers. Briefly use [it to] dislodge the phlegm, facilitate the orifices, and open and unblock the Heart qi so that the spirit and ethereal soul naturally become tranquil.
- In Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, Zhan Shan-Lei gives a detailed explanation of the proper use of this herb to restore communication between the Heart and Kidneys and what may happen if it is not used properly. Communication is disrupted, he says, when the Heart yang is not stimulated, the clear qi sinks and descends, while at the same time the Kidney qi is deficient and cold, and unable to rise up. The warm, raising Polygalae Radix (yuan zhi) is then used to lift what has sunken down, and prompts the Kidney yang to rise-this is the proper treatment. ... Yet most people do not investigate [the situation]: as soon as they encounter the failure of the Kidney yang to be contained, in a pattern such as nocturnal emissions, they declare this to be a 'loss of relations between [the trigrams] kan and li-Polygalae Radix (yuan zhi) must be used to prompt the reconnection of fire and water!' But this simply causes the ministerial fire to float upward even more, and renders the Kidneys less able to contain. The ability to 'facilitate the nine orifices' [from the description of Polygalae Radix (yuan zhi)] then applies: this makes the essence orifice leak, and [the herb's] ability to 'benefit the essence' soon becomes, instead, the loss of essence.

- Expels phlegm, clears the orifices, and stops coughs: used when phlegm envelops the orifice of the Heart with such manifestations as emotional and mental disorientation, spasms, or seizures. Also used for phlegm affecting the Lungs with copious sputum, especially when it is difficult to expectorate. Recently, it has also been used for angina pectoris.
    - With Curcumae Radix (yu jin) and Acori tatarinowii Rhizoma (shi chang pu) for disorientation associated with phlegm enveloping the orifice of the Heart.

    - With Fritillariae cirrhosae Bulbus (chuan bei mu), Armeniacae Semen (xing ren), and Trichosanthis Fructus (gua lou) for cough and wheezing due to cold-phlegm that leads to viscous sputum that is difficult to expectorate.
    - With Raphani Semen (lai fu zi), Sinapis Semen (bai jie zi), and Vaccariae Semen (wang bu liu xing) for angina pectoris due to cold-phlegm and blood stasis.
- Reduces abscesses and dissipates swellings: for boils, abscesses, sores, and swollen, painful breasts. Used in powdered form and applied topically, or taken with wine.
    - A decoction of this herb may be mixed with a little rice wine and applied topically for the early stages of sores.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
This herb is relatively warm and drying, and, unless prepared, can be irritating when ingested. Contraindicated for those with yin deficiency with heat signs as well as those with peptic ulcers or gastritis. See Toxicity below.
- According to some traditional sources, this herb antagonizes Chrysanthemi Flos (ju hua).
- Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic Materia Medica observes that it is quite oily in form and nature, and should not be taken by those with Intestinal leakage causing diarrhea, or by those with excessive phlegm around the diaphragm. 
- Its standard contraindications are [in those cases of] "repeated erections", "Kidney patients with heat", and summerheat dampness causing diarrhea.
- The references to repeated erections and Kidney patients with heat reflect the views of earlier materia medica texts that Platycladi Semen (bai zi ren) could treat cold in the Kidneys and Bladder, and stimulate male sexual function.
- Medicinal Combining adds: "Forbidden in four situations: those with excessive phlegm, Lung qi floating upward, loose stools, and Stomach deficiency with an urge to vomit."
- According to some traditional sources, this herb counteracts Margarita (zhen zhu) and Veratri nigri Radix et Rhizoma (li lu).
- This has no tonifying property, so for patterns of deficiency involving stagnation, use it together with herbs that nourish the blood and tonify the qi; to reestablish harmonious communication between the Heart and Kidneys, it provides guidance and dissemination to attain grand harmony. It cannot be used in a large dosage, or by itself. If one who is purely deficient, without obstruction, should mistakenly ingest it, it will give him heart pain with a suspended, empty sensation. When the Heart channel has fire from excess, one should use Coptidis Rhizoma (huang lian) and Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) [in combination with it; and when there is fire] it is forbidden to use it together with Ginseng Radix (ren shen), Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu), or other herbs that tonify the yang qi [as one would otherwise often do].
