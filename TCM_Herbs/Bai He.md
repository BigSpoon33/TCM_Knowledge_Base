## 📖 Overview

Sweet and moistening, _Lilii Bulbus_ (_bai he_) enriches the Lung yin; slightly bitter and cold, it clears the Heart, drains, and clarifies while directing downward. It is best for moistening the Lungs to stop coughs, and clearing the Heart to quiet the spirit. _Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica_ says that it is "slightly sweet, bland and neutral; moderate in effect. Because it is sweet and moderate, it can tonify and augment the qi and blood, moisten the Lungs to eliminate cough, settle the corporeal soul, quiet the spirit, drive out anxiety, and stop palpitations."

It is used to treat dry cough due to Lung dryness or coughing of blood due to deficiency consumption. It also treats mental disorientation, palpitations, insomnia, and an indefinable feeling of constraint due to yin deficiency, or to disharmony of the nutritive and protective qi following an externally-contracted illness.

In the earliest record of its properties, the _Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica_ states that it is "sweet, neutral, governs pathogenic qi, abdominal distension and Heart pain, facilitates [passage of] stool and urine, tonifies the middle and augments qi." The _Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians_ adds that it "eliminates edema, abdominal distention, focal distention, chills and fever, pain all over the body, difficult lactation, and painful obstruction of the throat."

In _Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica_, Zhang Shan-Lei explains:

_Lilii Bulbus_ (_bai he_) is sweet and cold, and also a bitter, slippery, and moistening substance. Although the _Classic of the Materia Medica_ calls it sweet and neutral, its main indications, ancient and modern, suggest that its nature is to clear heat, drain, and direct downward. When the _Classic of the Materia Medica_ and _Miscellaneous Records_ state that it 'governs pathogenic qi' and 'governs chills and fevers', they are referring to a heat pathogen that has collected. [As to its treatment of the other symptoms] they are all due to its slippery, moistening ability to open up areas of clumping, and its unblocking, facilitating, draining, and guiding actions. The _Classic of the Materia Medica_ also says that it tonifies the middle and augments the qi, and when texts like the _Materia Medica of Hua-Zi Ri_ state that it also quiets the spirit and strengthens the resolve, this refers to elimination of pathogenic heat and recovery of normal qi—it does not mean that sweet, cold substances tonify the qi.

The most well-known application of this herb is illustrated in _Essentials from the Golden Cabinet_ in relation to what is called lily bulb disorder (_bai he zheng_), characterized by mental disorientation, irritability, insomnia, palpitations, bitter taste, and dark, scanty urine. This usually occurs following an externally-contracted disease. _Rectification of the Meaning of the Golden Cabinet_ explains:

"This pattern is a result of a pathogenic influence interacting with the nutritive level of the Heart and the protective level of the Lungs. The Heart governs the hundred vessels, the Lungs govern the transformation of qi throughout the body.... The reason that _Lilii Bulbus_ (_bai he_) is chosen in the treatment method... is that the qi of _Lilii Bulbus_ (_bai he_) is extremely clearing, and enters the Lungs; its flavor is slightly bitter, and enters the Heart; so it is most capable of clearing the upper burner, and thus serves as the chief."
