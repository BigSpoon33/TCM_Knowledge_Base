Commentary 
Sweet, bitter, and slightly cold, Pyrrosiae Folium (shf wei) 
primarily enters the Lung and Bladder channels. Sweet and 
bland flavors leach and facilitate dampness, bitterness and 
cold clear and drain Lung heat from the upper body while 
facilitating Bladder function in the lower body. The Lungs 
are the upper source of fluids: if the source is clear, the flow 
will be also be clear. Thus, while Pyrrosiae Folium (shf wei) 
excels at facilitating the fluids and unblocking painful uri-
nary dribbling, it also clears the Lungs and alleviates cough. 
In addition, it cools the blood and stops bleeding. Thus, 
it is most appropriate for hot painful urinary dribbling, 
stony painful urinary dribbling, and painful urinary drib-
bling with blood in the urine. It is often used for cough and 
wheezing due to Lung heat, or epistaxis, or irregular uterine 
bleeding due to blood heat. 
Reverence for the Origin of the Materia Medica observes 
that it 
helps the essential qi of the Lungs and Kidney, linking 
together the upper and lower parts of the body. Water 
essence rises to moisten, so the orifices of the upper body 
and the exterior orifices are each unblocked; Lung qi 
descends to transform, so the Auid pathways are mobilized 
and urination is facilitated. 
Zhang Shan-Lei, however, noted that, because Pyrrosiae 
Folium (shf wei) grows in the dark grottos of deep moun-
tains, "it obtains pure yin qi, and its flavor is bitter; it is a 
cold, cooling thing, of this there can be no doubt." Zhang 
went on to say that its benefit to the five yin organs or the 
essential qi derives only from its ability to remove patho-
genic influences: "essential qi, that is, yin qi, is actually true 
yin: if pathogenic heat is eliminated, true yin is naturally 
augmented." 
Comparisons 
::;.. Vs. TALCUM (hua shi) 
Both herbs are cold by nature and unblock painful urinary 
dribbling. They are commonly used together in the treat-
ment of hot painful urinary dribbling or stony painful 
urinary dribbling. Pyrrosiae Folium (shf wei), however, 
also cools the blood and stops bleeding, and thus is best 
for painful urinary dribbling with bleeding. By contrast, 
Talcum (hua shi) is slippery and facilitates dampness, 
and is thus more appropriate for damp-heat painful uri-
nary dribbling and stony painful urinary dribbling. Aside 
from this, Pyrrosiae Folium (shf wei) cools the Lungs and 
stops cough, cools the blood and alleviates bleeding, while 
Talcum (hua shi) cools summerheat and alleviates thirst.

Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "stone leather" 
The name of this herb is of some interest. The Grand 
Materia Medica says that "it grows widely on rocks, pro-
duces leaves like skin, hence the name 'stone leather'." The 
second character in this name is sometimes written with 
the grass classifier, 1f wei, making the name "stone reed." 
Zheng Bing-Cheng (alone among many) does write it this 
way, but then notes that "it grows leaves like cloth." Also 
note that, in ancient materia medica texts, the term tile 
leather (If."$" wa wei) is used to refer to Pyrrosiae Folium 
(shf wei) that is found growing on old roof tiles. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of thick, unfragmented leaves, 
pubescent at the lower surface.
