Commentary 
Bombyx batryticatus (bai jiang can) is acrid, such that it 
disperses, salty, such that it softens areas of hardness and

disperses clumping, and neutral. It enters the Lung and 
Liver channels. Drying by nature, it transforms phlegm and 
dries dampness. While it expels wind and drains heat, it 
also transforms phlegm to release spasms, reduces swelling 
and disperses clumping, and thus treats epileptic seizures 
due to phlegm-heat, toothache from head wind, itch-
ing due to wind rash, slurred speech from wind-phlegm, 
wind-stroke facial paralysis, scrofula, and phlegm nodules. 
Records of Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica 
notes that it "forcibly removes phlegm-dampness and 
disperses Liver wind." Zhang Shan-Lei says that it "clears, 
clarifies, and directs fire downward." 
The Grand Materia Medica quotes several writers, each 
of whom expands upon an aspect of its therapeutic proper-
ties. Zhang Jie-Gu says that it "is slightly warm by nature, 
faint in both aroma and flavor, light, floating and raising: 
yang within yang. Hence it can expel any type of wind in 
the skin [causing sensations] like insects crawling." Wang 
Kuang, a famous twelfth-century physician, observed: 
"Whenever the throat is swollen and painful, or there is 
throat painful obstruction, this will immediately cure it 
when it passes down the throat; it never fails. It has saved 
many people." Zhu Zhen-Heng explains: "It treats painful 
obstruction of the throat because of its clearing, transform-
ing qi, which treats ministerial fire, and disperses rebellious 
turbidity, clumping, and blockage." 
The fine powder of the ground, raw, or dry-fried silk-
worm can be ingested or applied externally. For example, 
raw silkworm powder mixed with aged vinegar and applied 
topically has shown good results for acute mastitis. Li Shi-
Zhen records an unusual application: "For those whose 
fingernails have softened and thinned, burn this, hold tl1e 
fingers in the smoke, and [the nails] will thicken." 
The relevance of the manner of death of the silkworm is 
emphasized in several texts. Li Shi-Zhen explains: 
Bombyx batryticatus (bdi jiiing cdn) are silkworms that 
became sick from wind. Treating wind, transforming 
phlegm, dispersing clumping, and promoting movement in 
the channels-this is called 'recognizing the significance of 
the mutual influence of qi, and applying it'." 
In Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting 
the Western, Zhang Xi-Chun explains that it 
is the mummified silkworm which died as it was about to 
molt, prevented from doing so by picking up wind. Because 
it was mummified by a wind disorder, it can guide exterior-
releasing herbs. It also has the power to release the exterior: 
when pox or rashes fail to emerge, Bombyx batryticatus 
(bdi jiang cdn) is most able to bring them out to the exte-
rior. Furthermore, Bombyx batryticatus (bdi Jiang cdn) 
mummifies without decaying: whenever patients have 
swollen, painful places that threaten to necrose, Bombyx 
batryticatus (bdi jiang cdn) can treat it. This is the marvel of 
mutual resonance in qi transformation. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
~ WITH ANGELICAE DAHURICAE RADIX (bai zhf}; 
see page 26 
Comparisons 
~ Vs. CrcADAE PERIOSTRACUM (chan tul) 
Both substances eliminate wind and release spasms, and 
are often combined in the treatment of headache, swollen 
throat, and convulsions due to patterns such as wind-heat 
in the Lung and Liver channels. Bombyx batryticatus (bai 
jiiing can), however, also has the ability to transform 
phlegm and disperse clumping, while Cicadae Periostra-
cum (chan tul) vents rashes and reduces superficial visual 
obstructions.

Traditional Contraindications 
Contraindicated for wind-stroke or childhood convulsions 
or night terrors if these are not due to externally-contracted 
pathogens, but rather to deficiency of the Heart with an 
uneasy spirit and ethereal soul, or blood deficiency causing 
spasms of the channels and collaterals. It should also not 
be used for continuous uterine bleeding, or pain following 
labor, if these are not due to wind-cold invading the exte-
rior. (Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of 
Materia Medica) 
According to some traditional sources, this substance 
antagonizes Platycodi Radix (jie geng), Poria (fu ling), 
Dioscoreae hypoglaucae Rhizoma (bl xie), and Mantidis 
Ootheca (sang piao xiiio). 
Toxicity 
The following side effects have been reported: nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, palpitations, a feeling of oppression in 
the chest, and pains in the chest. It may also cause allergic 
reactions with such symptoms as flushing and hot sensa-
tions of the face, numbness in the chest, difficulty swallow-
ing, tachypnea, restlessness, an oppressive feeling in the 
chest, pruritus of the extremities, and urticaria. In severe 
cases, dyspnea, allergic pneumonitis, and anaphylactic 
shock have been reported. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation "white mummified silkworm" 
Bombyx batryticatus (bai jiiing can) is the immature silk-
worm killed by the contagious fungus Beauveria bassiana 
before it reaches its silk-spinning stage. Enzymes from 
the fungus attack and dissolve the cuticle of the silkworm,
