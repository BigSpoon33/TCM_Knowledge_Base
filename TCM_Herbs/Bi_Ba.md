7 7 I Herbs that Warm the Interior and Expel Cold 
707 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Forbidden for yin deficiency, heat in the blood level, or 
fever and cough." (Encountering the Sources of the Classic 
of Materia Medica) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
This is also known as litsea seeds (;it !JG -f cheng qie zi). The 
earliest records of this herb, including the Grand Materia 
Medica, refer to it as the fruit of Piper cubeba (a plant 
related toP. nigrum-black pepper), which was imported 
into China. This was supplanted by the locally available 
Litsea cubeba, which is now the standard herb. The sev-
enteenth-century text Detailed Materia Medica reflects 
the initial stages of this process of substitution, saying that 
Litseae Fructus (b! cheng qie) is "acrid and warm; in the 
same category as Piperis Fructus (hu jiiio), but a different 
type [of pepper]." It goes on to say that "To use, remove 
the fruit stems and wrinkled skin, soak in wine, then steam 
for six hours. Pound it finely, dry in the sun, and take." At 
present, the stems and fruit pericarp are not removed, and 
it is generally used without further preparation, except for 
pulverization.

is also used for dysmenorrhea that presents primarily with 
a distended and painful lower abdomen that improves with

aches due to an exterior disorder. The dosage is l.S-6g.

11 I Herbs that Warm the Interior and Expel Cold 
with such symptoms as nausea, vomiting, belching, acid 
regurgiation, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain. 
-
With Alpiniae officinarum Rhizoma (gao liang jiang) 
and Zingiberis Rhizoma preparatum (pdo jiang) for ab-
dominal pain, vomiting, borborygmus, and diarrhea due to 
Stomach cold . 
. . . Add Codonopsis Radix (dang shen) and Atractylodis 
macrocephalae Rhizoma (bdi zhu) for deficiency and weak-
ness of the Spleen and Stomach. 
- With Chebulae Fructus (he zi), Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan 
jiang), and Cinnamomi Cortex (rim gul) for chronic diar-
rhea due to cold from deficiency. 
- With Styrax (su he xiang) and Benzoinum (an xl xiang) 
for severe attacks of damp-cold and turbid phlegm, as in 
Liquid Styrax Pill (su he xiang wdn). 
• Applied as a powder for toothache, often with Piperis 
Fructus (hu jiao). 
Commentary 
Acrid and hot, Piperis longi Fructus (bl bd) specifically 
travels to the Stomach and Intestines. While it warms 
cold that has sunk deeply into the middle burner, it also 
releases constrained cold in the Large Intestine. It is most 
appropriate for nausea and vomiting from cold in the 
Stomach, along with Intestinal pain. It can be used by itself, 
or combined with other herbs that warm the Stomach and 
promote the movement of qi, such as Magnoliae officina-
lis Cortex (hOu po), Aucklandiae Radix (mu xiang), and 
Alpiniae officinarum Rhizoma (gao lidngjiang). 
Omissions from the Grand Materia Medica states that 
it "warms the middle, drives qi downward, tonifies the 
lower back and feet, kills meaty odor, digests food, expels 
Stomach cold, [and treats] yin-type bulging disorders and 
ensconced lumps (fiit pi)." 
Both the Grand Materia Medica and Seeking Accuracy 
in the Materia Medica record that, by virtue of its strong 
dispersing quality, it is also used to treat toothache and 
headache due to deep source nasal congestion (.*-)Jill bi 
yuan); this action is most appropriate where cold is invol-
ved. However, in Rectification of the Meaning of Materia 
Medica, Zhang Shan-Lei disagrees: 
[It] is primarily a herb for cold from deficiency of the 
Spleen and Kidneys. Only Li Shi-Zhen states that it is an 
important herb for headache and deep source nasal con-
gestion, utilizing its acrid heat that enters the yang bright-
ness to disperse floating heat. We note that headaches do 
have a type associated with true cold that is appropriate 
for very acrid and very hot herbs; however, deep source 
nasal congestion and toothache are fundamentally fire dis-
orders. When the ancients sometimes used acrid-dispers-
ing [herbs], this was basically using the idea of'opposites 
assisting'(&. 1£ fiin zuo) in order to guide in that direction. 
But Li Shi-Zhen, surprisingly, interprets this to mean dis-
persing floating fire! I am afraid this is mistaken. Zhang Lu 
agrees with him, but he is wrong.

Traditional Contraindications 
"Acrid, warm, and depleting through dispersal, it can 
disturb fire in the Spleen and Lungs; excessive use makes 
people's eyes blurry: it should particularly not be used in 
food." (Grand Materia Medica) 
"Excessive consumption overly mobilizes and thus drains 
the true qi, causing Intestinal deficiency and tenesmus." 
(Extension of the Materia Medica)
