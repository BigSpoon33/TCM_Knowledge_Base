## 📖 Overview

*Alpiniae oxyphyllae* Fructus (*yi zhi ren*) is acrid, warm, and aromatic, but also astringent, so that it warms the Spleen and Stomach to harmonize the middle, treat diarrhea, and contain excessive saliva; it also warms the Kidney yang and secures the lower burner. Thus it is often used in the treatment of Spleen and Stomach exposure to cold causing vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and excessive salivation; and for cold from deficiency of the Kidneys leading to spermatorrhea, urinary incontinence, and continuous uterine bleeding.

Essentials of the Materia Medica says that it binds the essence, stabilizes the *qi*, warms the middle to improve food intake, contains thick saliva and sputum, secures the urine, and treats nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lodged cold accosting the Stomach, cold *qi* abdominal pain, continuous uterine bleeding, vaginal discharge, and draining of the essence.

Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica adds that it "augments the Spleen and Stomach, regulates the primal *qi*, tonifies Kidney deficiency [which allows] slippage of essence, Stomach deficiency with excessive salivation, and continuous uterine bleeding in women."

Summarization of Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica summarizes: "Everything the commentators have said is nothing but the effect of warm binding ... it warmly tonifies the Spleen and Kidneys, but particularly governs securing and binding."
