## 📖 Overview

Acrid, bitter, and warm, the clear, strong aroma of Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qiang huo) has a powerful dispersing quality that can strongly raise and discharge wind, cold, or damp pathogens in the exterior.

Entering the qi level of the greater yang Bladder channel, it releases the superficial muscle layer from exterior wind-cold and cold-dampness with such symptoms as headache, stiff neck, and sore shoulders. As it enters the qi level of the Liver and Kidney channels, it vents and eases the joints and is excellent for alleviating deep pain by removing wind-dampness and wind-cold-dampness from between the sinews and bones. For these reasons it is a commonly used herb for painful obstruction, especially in the upper body.

Essentials of the Materia Medica observes that Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qiang huo) is most appropriate for Governing vessel disorders involving muscular tetany (jing). When there is damage from wind without sweating, it is called hard muscular tetany; with sweating it is called soft tetany. There is also blood deficiency tetany. In general, both Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qiang huo) and Angelicae pubescentis Radix (du huo) are appropriate for wind disorders, but are forbidden for blood deficiency tetany.

Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica explains the use of the acrid, dispersing property of Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qiang huo) for sores and boils as "using its ability to expel pus and draw out toxins, bring lesions to a head, and regenerate tissues."
