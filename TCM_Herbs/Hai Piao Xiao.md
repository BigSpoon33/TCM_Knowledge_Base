## 📖 Overview

Salty, astringent, and slightly warm, Sepiae Endoconcha (*hai piao xiao*) is drying and inhibiting by nature. It enters the blood level of the Liver channel where it restrains bleeding, dries dampness, and stops vaginal discharge; it enters the Kidney channel to secure the essence and prevent leakage; and it enters the Stomach to control acidity, stop epigastric pain, and treat diarrhea and dysenteric disorders with "pain in the region of the navel." The latter observation is drawn from the Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians, where it is noted that Sepiae Endoconcha (*hai piao xiao*) treats "fright qi entering the abdomen, [causing] abdominal pain in the region of the navel."

The Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi says that it "Remedies incessant uterine bleeding." Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica says that it is salty, slightly warm, and nontoxic; it enters the leg terminal yin and [leg] lesser yin channels. Terminal yin is a blood storage organ, and for women, the blood is primary; if [the Liver is] deficient there will be continuous red-and-white spotting.

In Zhang Bing Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Cheng explains:

Its flavor is salty, its nature is warm, and it is a medicinal of the blood level of the Liver channel. Although it is a blood herb, it has a drying quality, thus it can treat [both] vaginal bleeding and vaginal discharge, turbid painful urinary dribbling, and all disorders with erosion and seepage involving the genitals.

Ground into powder and applied topically, it restrains and inhibits seepage while generating flesh, and is used in the treatment of bleeding due to trauma, sores, or eczema. It is particularly appropriate for chronically open moist sores that will not heal over. Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians states that it "alleviates profuse suppurating sores with thick fluid that never dries."

Records of Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica explains that it enters the Kidney channel because it is itself a bone, and that while the flesh of the cuttlefish is moistening, the bone is solely drying. It makes the interesting observation that "because it enters the blood, it can also dry dampness within the blood ... continuous red-and-white spotting, genital lesions and painful swelling, sores with profuse suppuration: these are [examples of] blood made chaotic by dampness. Treat with [Sepiae Endoconcha (*hai piao xiao*)]."

The Grand Materia Medica recommends 3g powdered, taken with the fresh juice of Rehmanniae Radix (*sheng di huang*), to treat painful urinary dribbling with blood in the urine. If this is not available, a decoction of Rehmanniae Radix (*sheng di huang*) will work as well as the fresh juice.
