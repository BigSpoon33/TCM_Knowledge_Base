## 📖 Overview

Sweet, acrid, and neutral, *Typhae Pollen* (pu huang) enters the blood aspect of the Liver, Heart, and Spleen channels. Because it is sweet, and neither warming nor cooling, it harmoniously removes blood stasis and stops bleeding, while also promoting urination. It is one of the herbs that stops bleeding without leaving foci for subsequent blood stasis. It is particularly good in the treatment of hematuria, and is also widely used for bleeding from the nose, mouth, intestines, and uterus. It can also be applied topically. It can be used for pain from blood stasis, for example, in cases of thoracic painful obstruction, and postpartum obstruction.
The Grand Materia Medica says that it "Stops all pain in the Heart and abdomen."
The Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica observes that it is "Sweet, neutral, governs cold and heat in the Heart, abdomen, and Bladder, facilitates urination, stops bleeding, and eliminates stagnant blood."
With respect to the aforementioned "cold and heat," Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica explains that the nutritive and protective *qi* is unable to circulate in the places where blood clumps, and this causes sensations of heat and cold due to disharmony in the nutritive and protective *qi*. *Typhae Pollen* (pu huang) disperses this clumping, thus restoring harmony and eliminating the sensations of cold and heat.

Since at least the Song dynasty this herb has been regarded as slippery in its unprepared form, and astringent when dry-fried. Thus the unprepared herb is used for breaking up blood stasis, reducing swelling, and promoting urination, while the dry-fried herb is used for stopping bleeding. This is echoed in Materia Medica Arranged by Channel: "Used unprepared, its nature is slippery, promoting blood movement and eliminating stasis; if fried black, its nature is astringent and stops bleeding." However, recent pharmacological and clinical research has cast some doubt on these views, and currently the herb is generally used in its unprepared form.

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica observes:
If there are disorders such as ulcers of the mouth and tongue or itching damp skin diseases, apply the fine powder of the unprepared herb and the disorders will be cured. This utilizes its fine, sticky, congealing [properties], which naturally have the power to generate flesh, as well as its clearing and cooling properties.
