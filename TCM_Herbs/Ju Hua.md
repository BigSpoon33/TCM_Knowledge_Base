## 📖 Overview

Chrysanthemi Flos (*ju hua*) is cooling, aromatic, light, and slightly cold and bitter in taste, within which is a sweet flavor. It can rise to disperse wind-heat in the Lungs, cool and drain Liver channel heat, while also benefiting the Liver yin and blood, to calm and direct Liver and Gallbladder fire downward. It also cools heat and clears toxins. *Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica* notes that "All flowers lift, dissipate, and drain - only Chrysanthemi Flos (*ju hua*) contains, accepts, and directs downward to calm Liver fire, extinguish internal wind, and thus suppress the transverse rebellion of wood qi accosting the earth."

Ever since the earliest materia medica text, the *Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica*, the beneficial effects of long-term consumption of Chrysanthemi Flos (*ju hua*) have been recognized. "Taken over a long time," it says, "it will facilitate the qi and blood, lighten the body, and prevent aging." It has long been a favorite of Daoists and poets alike. The famous painter Zheng Ban-Qiao (one of the Eight Eccentrics of eighteenth-century Yangzhou) exclaimed in a poem:

Tasting chrysanthemum tea of old - this flower of Longevity!
A man of eighty years picks and sips, assiduous;
Teaching his frosty beard to turn raven-black.

The key, indeed, is persistence, as emphasized by many writers. Chen Shi-Duo, for example, observed: "Sweet chrysanthemum flower is light and clear in flavor and nature, and its effect is particularly leisurely; it must be taken over a long time before it starts to take effect. One cannot simply take more to try for earlier results."

*Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica* elaborates on the herb's properties:

Sweet chrysanthemum flower is sweet, bitter, and slightly cold. Thoroughly imbued with the qi of the four seasons, it sprouts in winter, produces leaves in spring, blossoms in summer, and reaches full flower in autumn. In its fullness, it embraces the frost and succumbs to the essence of metal and water, thus it is able to benefit the two organs, the Lungs and Kidneys. This controls Heart fire and calms Liver wood; with wood calmed, the wind is extinguished; when fire is directed downward, heat is eliminated. Thus, it can nourish the eyes and the blood [and thereby] expel superficial visual obstructions - if it is combined with Lycii Fructus (*gou qi zi*) in a honey pill and taken for an extended period, there will never be any eye problems - it also treats lacrimation and dizziness. It dispels damp painful obstruction and wandering wind.

Sipped as tea, drunk in wine, or placed in a pillow: all ways are effective. Use Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (*bai zhu*), Lycii Fructus (*gou qi zi*), and Lycii Cortex (*di gu pi*) as assistants.

In fact, certain herbs can be added to chrysanthemum flower made as a tea to treat or prevent a number of illnesses. For example, Lycii Fructus (*gou qi zi*) adds a very pleasant taste and an attractive color to the tea, with the additional benefit of strongly enhancing the eye-soothing action of Chrysanthemi Flos (*ju hua*). It is an ideal everyday drink for those whose work strains the eyes. With the addition of Mori Folium (*sang ye*) to the tea, Chrysanthemi Flos (*ju hua*) can prevent wind-heat attacks or wind-heat affecting the eyes. With Sterculiae lychnophorae Semen (*pang da hai*), the voice and throat are soothed, and bowel regularity is maintained. Crataegi Fructus (*shan zha*) and Cassiae Semen (*jue ming zi*) in Chrysanthemi Flos (*ju hua*) tea is beneficial for hypertension or high cholesterol. And with Lonicerae Flos (*jin yin hua*), the toxicity-resolving effect of Chrysanthemi Flos (*ju hua*) is emphasized, while the tea still tastes quite pleasant.

The root, sprout, and leaf can also be used as medicine to dispel wind, cool heat, and resolve toxicity, but their quality and effect is far less potent than the flower. Instead, they are often powdered and applied externally for sores and boils.
