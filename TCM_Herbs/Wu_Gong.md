Commentary 
Scolopendra (wu gong) is acrid, warm, toxic, and enters the 
Liver channel. By nature it excels at travelling and piercing, 
with a strong ability to track down wind and stop spasms 
and convulsions. It is thus an important substance for 
extinguishing wind and settling spasms in disorders such 
as childhood convulsions and deviation of the mouth and 
eyes due to wind-stroke and tetanus. It also attacks toxicity 
and disperses clumping, and is thus used in the treatment 
of scrofula, phlegm nodules, toxic sores, wind lichen sim-
plex, and poisonous snakebite; it can be ingested or applied 
topically in these cases. 
The Grand Materia Medica explains that it 
can control snakes, so it also can check wind; it is a 
medicinal substance of the leg terminal yin channel, hence 
the patterns it governs all belong to leg terminal yin. 
Note that Straight Direction from [Yang] Ren-Zhai states: 
'Scolopendra (wu gong) is toxic, and can only be used for 
violent sudden wind qi.' Wind qi that is violent and sudden 
cannot be easily stopped without the ability of Scolopendra 
(wu gong) to check and to capture [it]-this is the merit in 
matching illness and remedy. If the dose proves excessive, 
use Pheretima (dl Long) and Mori Cortex (sang bdi pi) to 
resolve it. 
Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting 
the Western elaborates: 
[It] has the most rapid power to travel and pierce. 
Internally in the organs, externally in the channels and col-
laterals, wherever there are places with congealed accumu-
lation of qi and blood, it can unblock them .... Its nature 
is particularly excellent for tracking down wind, internally 
treating the initial stages of stirred-up Liver wind, or epi-
lepsy, dizziness, cramps and spasms, or children's umbilical 
wind. Externally, it treats wind-stroke in the channels and 
collaterals causing deviated mouth or eye, and numbness of 
the hands and feet. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
);;>- WITH SCORPIO (quan xie) 
Both are important wind-extinguishing substances that

16 I Substances that Extinguish Wind and Stop Tremors 
powerfully relieve spasms. Scorpio (quan xie) powerfully 
extinguishes wind, while Scolopendra (wu gong) is more 
effective at tracking down wind. Both enter the Liver 
channel. Mutually enhancing, they are a very effective 
combination with an extremely broad therapeutic scope 
that ranges from wind due to high fever leading to seizures 
and convulsions, to epilepsy, toxic swollen sores, scrofu-
la, and submandibular lymphadenitis. For the latter this 
combination can both be ingested or applied externally. 
Furthermore, it achieves good results in the treatment of 
stubborn migraines, and the pain of wind-damp painful 
obstruction. 
Comparisons 
~ Vs. BoMBYX BATRYTICATUS (baijiangcan) and 
ScoRPIO (quan xie) 
All three substances are important remedies to expel wind 
and stop spasms. Bombyx batryticatus (bai jiang can) tends 
to drain heat, expel wind, and transform phlegm, while 
Scorpio (quan xie) more strongly extinguishes wind and 
stops spasms, and is thus more effective in treating such 
patterns as tremors of the hands and feet, twitching, and 
torticollis. Scolopendra (wu gong) is strong and violent in 
its action, and is often used for opisthotonos, convulsions, 
and rigid spasms. 
All three substances can reduce swelling and disperse 
clumping, but Bombyx batryticatus (bdi jiang can) tends to 
transform phlegm and disperse clumping to treat throat 
painful obstruction; while Scorpio (quan xie) and Scolo-
pendra (wu gong) both attack the toxin to disperse clump-
ing, and thus are used in the treatment of heat toxin sores 
or scrofula and phlegm nodules. 
Toxicity 
Scolopendra is toxic, and overdosage may cause poisoning 
with such symptoms as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
diarrhea, fatigue and general weakness, yellow-colored 
sclera, disorientation, bradycardia, and shock. High doses 
can cause death from paralysis of the heart muscle and 
respiratory paralysis. Poisoning is extremely rare, however, 
as the toxin is not heat resistant: heating for 30 minutes at 
lOO"C will destroy the toxins. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
After cleaning and drying by stretching on bamboo slats, 
in the past the heads and legs were removed, or the heads 
removed and the legs cut short. The ancient names refer-
ring to centipede prepared in this manner are heavenly 
dragon ( 3\:.. it tian long) or hundred legs [centipede] (s 
li_ bai zu). However, this method is no longer considered 
necessary, as the head as well as the legs are very effective. 
The entire centipede is known as complete scolopendra ( ± 
~gy_,; quan wu gong). 
Prepared centipedes are produced in many parts of 
China, but the quality varies. Traditionally, the standard 
high quality product has reddish brown legs, for which 
the term red leg scolopendra (:ifF li_~~ chl zu wu gong) 
is used. Some think that the larger specimens are best, and 
thus specify large scolopendra ( ;k~gy_,; da wu gong). The 
custom is that centipedes from Sichuan province are con-
sidered best quality; they are called Sichuan scolopendra 
(Jil ~~ chuan wu gong or simply Jil gy_,; chuan gong), or 
Sichuan legs ( Jil li_ chuan zu). This traditional term is often 
used regardless of the source, as products from elsewhere 
in China, such as the Suzhou area, are quite acceptable. 
Unprepared scolopendra is quite toxic, and should be 
taken for the shortest possible time. As soon as a reduction 
in symptoms is seen, its use should be terminated. 
~ WINE-PREPARED SCOLOPENDRA 
Oilli ~~gy_,; jiu zhl wu gong) 
Sections of centipedes with the head and legs removed are 
soaked in yellow rice wine, left covered briefly as the wine is 
absorbed, then baked dry at a low temperature. This meth-
od of preparation reduces its toxicity and moderates its 
violent nature, so that it is especially indicated for patients 
with weak constitutions that have scrofula, phlegm nod-
ules, or mobile and fixed abdominal masses. These types 
of disorders usually require longer term consumption, and 
this method of preparation reduces the chance of poison-
ing, while enhancing its ability to disperse clumping. 
~ ScOLOPENDRA HEAD (~gy_,;jJ[ wugong t6u) 
Traditionally, the centipede head was regarded as a pow-
erful medicinal for tetanus, with its rapid onset of severe 
symptoms. For example, the formula Scolopendra Powder 
(wu gong san) from Confucians' Duties to Their Parents 
combines scolopendra head, Aconiti Radix preparata (wu 
t6u), Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhl fu zi), and 
Scorpio (quan xie), taken as a powder and mixed with hot 
wine, to treat the symptoms of lockjaw, convulsions, and 
opisthotonos associated with tetanus. However, because all 
of the ingredients are very toxic, this should only be used in 
this extreme type of excess toxic qi attacking internally. 
~ SCOLOPENDRA POWDER (~gy_,; ;t_ WU gong mo) 
The centipede is dry-fried or baked until yellow and crisp, 
then ground into fine powder. It can be taken with water, 
made into pills, or applied topically (sometimes mixed with 
egg white or vinegar) for such disorders as toxic swellings, 
deep-set toxic sores, scrofula, and ulcerations of the lower 
limb.
