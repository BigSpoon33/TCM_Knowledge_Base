## üìñ Overview

Acrid, bitter, and warm, *Eleutherococci gracilistyli* Cortex (*wu jia pi*) enters the Liver and Kidney channels, disperses pathogenic wind-dampness, while also warmly tonifying the yang qi of the Kidney and Liver. When wind-dampness is eliminated, the pain of painful obstruction disorder and cramping spasms will naturally disappear; when the yang qi of the Liver and Kidneys recovers, the sinews and bones are then warmed, nourished, and strengthened, erasing the weakness or restricted movement in the joints.

The principal indications of *Eleutherococci gracilistyli* Cortex (*wu jia pi*) are therefore joint pain due to wind-damp painful obstruction disorder, and cramping and difficult movement of the sinews; but it is also useful in the treatment of impotence, scrotal dampness, itching due to skin dampness, genital itching in either sex, cold aching of the lower back and spine, and developmental delay in those motor skills which permit a young child to take its first steps. It also promotes the flow of urine, and is therefore used for edema at the skin level.

Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica elaborates on the scope of action of the herb:

At present, people only know that this [substance] regulates leg qi, but do not know that leg qi disorder is formed from the three influences of wind, cold, and dampness. When wind prevails, the sinews and bones contract; when dampness prevails, the sinews and vessels relax, [causing], in males, impotence and scrotal dampness, and in females, genital itching and parasite generation; and in children, weakness of the feet. When coldness prevails, the blood vessels congeal and stagnate, the sinews and bones ache, and the feet, owing to this, cannot walk. When consuming this acrid, bitter, and warm [substance], its acridity smooths the flow of qi to transform phlegm, its bitterness strengthens the bones and augments the essence, and its warmth dispels wind and overcomes dampness.

Because *Eleutherococci gracilistyli* Cortex (*wu jia pi*) supports the normal qi while eliminating pathogenic qi, it is best used for pain in the lower back and legs and sensations of weakness in the sinews and bones when these symptoms are due to wind-damp painful obstruction coexisting with deficiency of the Liver and Kidneys. For scrotal dampness or genital itching, *Eleutherococci gracilistyli* Cortex (*wu jia pi*) must be combined with herbs that clear dampness or damp-heat. Likewise, in the treatment of impotence or slowed development of walking skills in infants, it must be combined with herbs that tonify the Liver and Kidneys.

Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica elaborates:

Acridity smooths the flow of qi and transforms phlegm; bitterness strengthens the Kidneys and augments the essence; warmth dispels wind and prevails over dampness. [*Eleutherococci gracilistyli Cortex (wu jia pi)*] treats contraction of the sinews and bones, drives out stagnant blood in the skin, treats impotence, scrotal dampness, and gynecological itching; improves the vision, secures the urine, cures sores and bulging disorders. Especially good in wine; Polygalae Radix (*yuan zhi*) is its envoy.

## ‚ö° Functions & Actions

Dispels wind-dampness and strengthens the sinews and bones: for chronic wind-cold-damp painful obstruction when chronic deficiency of the Liver and Kidneys generates weak or soft sinews and bones. This herb is especially useful when the smooth flow of qi and blood is obstructed. It is particularly suitable for the elderly, and for developmental delays in the motor functions of children.
    *   With Eucommiae Cortex (*du zhong*) for aching joints, especially in the lower back and lower extremities, due to wind-dampness in patients with Liver and Kidney deficiency. Also for hypertension in those with Liver and Kidney deficiency.
    *   With Clematidis Radix (*wei ling xian*), Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (*qiang huo*), and Gentianae macrophylla Radix (*qin jiao*) for pain and muscular spasms due to wind-damp painful obstruction.
    *   With Taxilli Herba (*sang ji sheng*), Achyranthis bidentatae Radix (*niu xi*), and Dipsaci Radix (*xu duan*) for painful obstruction due to long-term illness and subsequent Liver and Kidney deficiency. This combination can also be used in treating developmental delays in the motor functions of children, especially with the addition of Chaenomelis Fructus (*mu gua*).
    *   With Pyritum (*zi ran tong*), Olibanum (*ru xiang*), and Eupolyphaga/Steleophaga (*tu bie chong*) for trauma, including fractures.
Transforms dampness and reduces swelling: for urinary difficulty, edema, and cold damp leg qi.
    *   With Arecae Pericarpium (*da fu pi*) and Poriae Cutis (*ju ling pi*) for mild, superficial edema, as in Five-Peel Decoction (*wu pi yin*).
