## üìñ Overview

Sweet, salty, and pure yin, Testudinis Plastrum (gui ban) tonifies the Kidneys, enriches the yin, and unblocks the Conception vessel. In Case Records as a Guide to Clinical Practice, Ye Tian-Shi says that it is "yin by nature and travels through the Conception vessel." By strongly tonifying the yin, it treats steaming bones, consumptive heat, and night sweats; when yin is fortified, it can control the yang and extinguish internal wind, thus subduing the ascendant Liver yang that could lead to vertigo and tinnitus, and the internal wind that causes spasms and convulsions. As a bone-like substance, it strengthens the bones and sinews and is thus used for weakness of the lower back and legs as well as delayed closure of the fontanel in infants. By unblocking the Conception vessel, it treats spermatorrhea, continuous uterine bleeding, vaginal discharge, and excessive menstrual bleeding.

Supplement to the Extension of the Materia Medica says that "the lower plate tonifies the yin and governs insufficiency of yin and blood ... treating consumptive exhaustion [causing] lack of power in the extremities." Essentials of the Materia Medica says that it enriches yin, strengthens the resolve, and treats yin and blood insufficiency, consumptive heat, steaming bones, long-term cough, malarial disorder, mobile and fixed abdominal masses, continuous uterine bleeding, the five [types of] hemorrhoids, difficult labor, and patterns of yin deficiency and frail blood.

The Detailed Materia Medica elaborates:

The ancients used the dorsal shell and the ventral shell interchangeably; only the [Materia Medica of] Ri Hua-Zi started to use the ventral plate. Now, the turtle is yin, and the ventral plate is extreme yin within yin, with a very strong Kidney-tonifying action, such that the illnesses it governs are all those caused by Kidney deficiency.

Generally, medicinals that enrich the yin and direct fire downward are cold and injure the Stomach, yet Testudinis Plastrum (gui ban) has the sweet flavor of the middle regions‚Äîa truly fine substance.

In Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing Cheng notes:

The turtle (gui) is the spirit of the north, black in color, sweet, salty, and cold, entering the Kidney channel, with a head that often hides in its abdomen; thus, it unblocks the Conception vessel ... fortifies Kidney water, eliminates steaming bones, subdues deficient yang‚Äîits primary therapeutic effects are not apart from these. It is even better when boiled into glue.
