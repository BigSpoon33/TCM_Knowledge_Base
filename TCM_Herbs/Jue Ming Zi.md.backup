## 📖 Overview

This herb is bitter, sweet, salty, and cool. Entering the Liver, Large Intestine, and Kidney channels, its nature is moistening, and it can raise as well as direct downward. Besides expelling wind-heat and cooling Liver fire, it nourishes the Liver and Kidney yin and moistens the Intestines. Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica elaborates:

[It]can enter the Liver channel to expel wind and disperse fire. Whenever a person's eyes tear without stop and ache without relief, this is usually from wind-heat invading the interior. The treatment should be to banish [the pathogen] in order to arrest blood's upward movement. Note that this herb is bitter to drain heat, salty to soften areas of hardness, sweet to tonify blood; it is mild in effect with an aroma that ascends, so that it can also raise up and disperse pathogenic wind. Thus, it is an important herb for treating the eyes, reducing excessive tearing, and alleviating pain.

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica adds that "The reason that Cassiae Semen (jue ming zi) brightens the eyes is that it enriches and benefits the Liver and Kidneys, both nourishing and suppressing."
