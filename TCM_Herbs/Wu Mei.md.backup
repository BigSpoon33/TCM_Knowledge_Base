## 📖 Overview

Sour, astringent, and warm, with a nature that specifically restrains and inhibits, when Mume Fructus (*wu mei*) enters the Lungs it alleviates cough, when it enters the Large Intestine it stops diarrhea, and travelling the lower burner it stabilizes incessant uterine bleeding. In all of these disorders its effects are due to its sour, astringent, and binding properties. Yet its sourness also enters the Stomach to generate yang fluids and stop thirst, and in the Intestines it quiets parasitic activity. Thus it can be used for Lung deficiency leading to long-term cough, Spleen deficiency causing chronic diarrhea, bleeding from the bowel or gynecological bleeding, thirst due to heat from deficiency, and abdominal pain due to intestinal parasites.

Used externally, it opens the orifices and opens up closure, such as the closed type wind-stroke with tightly clenched jaws, for which the flesh of the fruit can be rubbed on the gums. It also eliminates dead, noxious flesh, such as that surrounding toxic sores. Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica includes this note: Formulary of the Bureau of Medicines of the Taiping Era [has a formula] using Mume Fructus (*wu mei*) with honey as a flat cake applied [to noxious flesh]. The Simple Convenient Formulas reports: 'A sore developed on the arm. Only after 100 days did the pus perforate and [the sore] heal. In its midst was noxious flesh protruding upward. I tried this formula; after one day and night more than one half of it was eliminated. It was applied again for one day-it levelled out. Only then did I realize that miraculous formulas exist.'

In Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing Cheng explains its characteristics:

'Darkened plum [the literal meaning of *wu mei*] is the green plum that has been smoked black over a fire at the yellow stage. Its flavor is sour, nature is warming, and specifically enters the blood level in Liver patients, while also indirectly influencing the Spleen, Lungs, and Large Intestine. Its functions are specifically to restrain, inhibit, stop, and bind up, thus it can be used for all chronic coughs, chronic dysenteric disorders, deficient sweat, and devastated blood. Its ability to quiet parasites is because parasites hide when encountering sour [flavors].'
