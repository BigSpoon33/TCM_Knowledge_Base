Obsolete Substances 
THIS CHAPTER CONTAINS herbs and other substances 
that are present in the Chinese materia medica, but 
which should not be used at this time. They fall into two 
categories: those whose toxicity renders them too danger-
ous to use, and those which are derived from endangered 
species. This categorization should not be viewed as etched 
in stone, but it does reflect the current status of these sub-
stances. 
Section 1 
SUBSTANCES WITH 
UNACCEPTABLE TOXICITY 
The substances in this section are considered obsolete 
because the toxicity/benefit ratio is too high to be accept-
able. While some of them may be useful under very special 
circumstances, due to their toxicity, we feel it best to rec-
ommend that they not be used at all.

Commentary 
Cinnabaris (zhu sha) is sweet, cold, and heavy in weight. 
Its coldness directs fire downward ("heaviness suppresses 
trepidation", in the oft-quoted words of the sixth-century 
physician Xu Zhi-Cai), and its crimson color signals that 
it enters the Heart channel. Thus it clears fire, sedates the 
Heart, arrests jitteriness and anxiety, and quiets the spirit. 
Because the Heart governs the spirit and resolve, which 
reside in the Heart, suppression of fire restores calm to 
the Heart. Cinnabaris (zhu sha) has therefore been used as 
an important medicinal for irritability, restless insomnia, 
withdrawal-mania, and childhood convulsions. 
Applied topically, it treats toxic sores and carbuncles, 
breaks up mobile and fixed abdominal masses, and is an 
antidote for toxins due to bites from poisonous animals 
and insects. 
Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of 
Materia Medica states that it 
is a medicinal that cools and sedates the princely fire of the 
lesser yin. It quiets and settles the consciousness, so that the 
essence and spirit are secured. When fire no longer blazes 
exuberantly, metal and wood become calm so that the 
ethereal soul and the corporeal soul can settle down. The 
strength of qi naturally doubles. 
The Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica 
observes that "Cinnabaris (zhu sha) is sweet, slightly cold, 
and governs all the illnesses of the body's five yin organs; 
nourishes consciousness, quiets the ethereal soul and the 
corporeal soul, augments the qi, and brightens the eyes." 
In Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, 
Zhang Jie-Bin elaborates on these attributes: 
[It] enters the Heart to quiet the spirit and travel through 
the blood vessels; it enters the Lungs to direct qi downward 
and travel through the skin; it enters the Spleen to drive out 
phlegm and drool, and travel through the flesh and mus-
cles; it enters the Liver to promote the movement of static 
blood and travel through the sinews and membranes; it 
enters the Kidneys to drive out pathogenic water and travel 
through the bones and marrow. Whether in the upper or 
lower [body], there is no place it does not reach, thus it can 
sedate the Heart, drive out phlegm, expel pathogens, direct 
fire downward, treat childhood convulsions, kill poisons 
[from bites], eliminate noxious attacks [i.e., seizures from 
unknown causes such as demonic possession], sores, sca-
bies, and tinea. However, while its form is heavy, its nature 
is racing: it excels at moving and directing downward with 
unpredictable changes. Use it to treat excess [patterns]; this 
is its forte. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
)>- WITH MAGNETITUM (cf shi); see page 916 
Comparisons 
)>- WITH CoPTIDis RHIZOMA (huang lian) 
Both substances cool Heart fire and quiet the spirit and 
resolve. Cinnabaris (zhu sha), however, is also heavy and 
expels phlegm and is therefore the better choice for treat-
ing withdrawal-mania due to phlegm-fire. On the other 
hand, Coptidis Rhizoma (huang lian), while less able to 
calm the spirit, is better at draining fire, clearing heat, and 
cooling the blood, and is more often used for restlessness, 
irritability, delirium, and bleeding due to heat entering the 
nutritive level in febrile diseases. 
Again, both substances resolve toxicity, but Cinnabaris 
(zhu sha) is only used externally for this purpose, while 
Coptidis Rhizoma (huang lian) is both taken internally 
and applied topically. Moreover, Coptidis Rhizoma (huang 
lian) dries dampness and is therefore used for dysenteric 
disorders, focal distention, nausea, and vomiting associ-
ated with patterns of damp-heat. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Used by itself or to excess, it will make people slow-witted 
and dejected." (Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica) 
"Sedates and nourishes the Heart spirit, but should be used 
unprepared .... If refined with fire it is toxic, and taking 
it has often been fatal." (Harm and Benefit in the Materia 
Medica)
