## 📖 Overview

*Xian Mao* (Curculiginis Rhizoma) has a harsh nature that strongly tonifies the Kidney yang, stimulates the fire at the gate of vitality, and expels cold-dampness to warm the lower back and knees. It is slightly toxic, and should only be used for short periods until the desired effect is achieved. Because it warms the Kidney yang, it indirectly warms the Spleen yang and assists digestion. The Materia Medica of the Kaibao Era says that it

governs cold *qi* in the epigastrium and abdomen with inability to eat, wind-cold causing cramps and spasms in the lower back and knees making one unable to walk, damp consumption in men, incontinence in the elderly, and assists sexual function in males.

Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica adds that it

is hot in nature, and is an herb to tonify the Triple Burner and gate of vitality. It is only appropriate for those with impotence, cold essence, atrophy and weakness of the lower base, incontinence in the elderly, infertility, and males with deficient natural endowment.
