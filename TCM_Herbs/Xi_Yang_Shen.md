Also for the aftermath of a febrile disease with such symp-
toms as weakness, irritability, and thirst.

yin deficiency. See Clear Summerheat and Augment the Qi 
Decoction (qlng shu yl ql tang).

With Ophiopogonis Radix (mai men dong) and Schi-
sandrae Fructus (wu wei zi) for lethargy, a faint pulse, and 
thirst from extreme fluid loss in the course of a febrile 
disease. 
-
With Asparagi Radix (tii'm men dong) and Polygonati 
odorati Rhizoma (yu zhu) for parched mouth and throat

persing functions of the Lungs. The primary manifestation 
is long-term wheezing and coughing up blood-streaked 
sputum. Also for cough, coughing up blood, and loss of 
voice due to Lung yin deficiency. 
-

Colla (e jiao), and Scrophulariae Radix (xuan shen) for 
chronic cough where both the yin and qi have been deplet-
ed and there is fire from deficiency marked by a hacking 
cough or a barely productive cough with blood-streaked 
sputum. 
-
With Mori Folium (sang ye), Armeniacae Semen (xlng 
ren), and Eriobotryae Folium (pi pa ye) for a dry throat 
and coughing up blood from dryness and heat injuring the 
Lung yin. 
Commentary 
Sweet, slightly bitter, and cold in nature, Panacis quin-
quefolii Radix (xl yang shen) enters the Heart, Lung, and 
Kidney channels to tonify the qi, nourish the yin, clear 
Lung fire, and generate fluids. It is best used for patterns 
of qi and yin deficiency with heat or blazing fire, such as 
yin deficiency fire with cough and wheezing, coughing of 
bloody sputum, and febrile diseases injuring both the qi 
and yin and leading to exhaustion, thirst, dry tongue and 
mouth, and passage of blood in the stool due to Intestinal 
heat. The Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica notes that 
this herb "tonifies the Lungs, directs fire downward, gener-
ates fluids, eliminates irritability and fatigue, and is most 
appropriate for deficiency accompanied by fire." 
Discussion of Medicinal Properties adds that it "tonifies 
the yin and reduces heat. Prepared with ginger it augments 
the qi. Supports the normal qi." 
Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respect-
ing the Western observes that this herb "tonifies and assists 
the qi aspect, but also tonifies and augments the blood 
aspect." It also says that it "is cooling and tonifying, when-
ever one wishes to use Ginseng Radix (ren shen) but does 
not want the warmth of Ginseng Radix (ren shen), in all 
such cases this can be used as a substitute." 
Not all commentators agree, however. There has been 
considerable controversy about this herb and its effects 
since the time it was first imported to China in the early 
eighteenth century. Here is an example of the extreme view, 
which appears in Rectification of the Meaning of Materia 
Medica: 
Panacis quinquefolii Radix (xf yang shen) is produced in the 
American countries, and is not originally found in middle 
earth [i.e., China], thus it is not in the ancient books. Only 
Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica and Omissions from 
the Grand Materia Medica include it, and both say that its 
actions tonify the Lungs. However, its flavor is very bitter, 
[hence] its nature must be cold; and its reputation among 
others is that it is not to be regarded as a medicinal. It is 
just that my countrymen are excited by the word 'ginseng' 
and compete with each other to purchase it, so that the 
price daily increases, and counterfeits abound. But as to the 
real thing, it is nothing but a bitter, cold, fire-draining sub-
stance, quite effective if the Lungs and Stomach have fire 
that causes dryness of the mouth and throat, and although 
it appears to generate fluids and stop thirst, actually it is still 
best only for draining heat, so this 'cooling and nourishing 
the Lungs and Stomach' is just because it drives fire down-
ward .... Our country has many things that cool heat and 
moisten dryness, why prattle about miracles from overseas? 
The taste of the Panacis quinquefolii Radix (xl yang shen) 
that is presently available on the market is quite sweet and 
only slightly bitter. Some modern studies in China that 
have compared the constituents and clinical effects of this 
herb and Ginseng Radix (ren shen) have concluded that 
they are basically equivalent.

Traditional Contraindications 
"Its nature is bitter and cold; if those with cold in the yin 
organs consume it, it will adversely cause abdominal pain. 
If taken with constrained fire, the fire cannot vent outward 
and will instead lead to chills and fevers." (Harm and 
Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
"The use of metal implements and frying [in preparing this 
herb] is forbidden." (Omissions from the Grand Materia 
Medica)
