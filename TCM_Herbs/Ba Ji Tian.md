## 📖 Overview

Sweet and warm, such that it tonifies, but acrid and warm, such that it disperses, _Morindae officinalis_ Radix (bajitian) enters the Kidney channel to warm the Kidney yang, augment the essence, fortify the sinews and bones, and disperse wind, cold, and dampness. Yet its nature is soft and moistening, so that while it is warm, it is not overly drying, and its tonification is not cloying. In addition, as a tonic it is rather modest, and it is also considered to have a minor action in augmenting the blood. It is typically used with similar herbs for such problems as impotence due to Kidney yang deficiency, infertility, irregular menstruation, and abdominal pain due to cold in the Womb, and pain in the lower back and knees due to invasion of pathogenic wind-dampness taking advantage of Kidney yang deficiency. _Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica_ notes that this herb

> does not wither in the winter; it is an herb of the Kidney channel blood level and of the Penetrating vessel ... its nature both tonifies the primal yang and disperses pathogens. When the primal is tonified, how can a pathogen linger?

_Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica_ observes that,

> according to the books [it] is an important herb for Kidney tonification, because it is moist in nature. However, with an acrid, warm flavor, it also expels wind and dampness, so it is even better for symptoms such as pain in the lower back and knees, wind qiˋ, leg qiˋ, and edema.

_The Grand Materia Medica_ confirms that it "treats leg qiˋ, expels wind illnesses, and tonifies the sea of blood." The 'sea of blood' here refers to the Penetrating vessel.
