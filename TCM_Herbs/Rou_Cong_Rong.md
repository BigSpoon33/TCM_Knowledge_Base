Commentary 
Sweet, salty, and warm, Cistanches Herba (rou cong r6ng) 
has the special characteristic of tonifying the Kidney yang 
while also augmenting the essence and blood due to its 
moist, oily texture. These properties are also responsible 
for its ability to moisten the Intestines and treat constipa-
tion, especially among the elderly and those with deficiency 
of blood and fluids. 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica states 
that it 
is thick and heavy, and directs downward, entering straight 
into the Kidney channel, warming while moistening, with-
out causing injury through drying. Warmly nourishing the

essence and blood, it unblocks the yang qi, and thus aug-
ments the essence and qi. 
Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica elaborates, not-
ing that it 
is an herb that nourishes the gate of vitality, enriches the 
Kidney qi, and tonifies the essence and blood ... it is a 
neutral tonic that is warm without heating, tonifies without 
drastic effect, warms without drying, and lubricates without 
draining-this is why it has the name 'unhurried'. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
~ WITH ANGELICAE SINENSIS RADIX (dang gul) 
Both herbs are sweet, warm, and moisten the Intestines. 
Cistanches Herba (rou cong r6ng) warms the Kidneys and 
augments the essence and blood to nourish the sinews, 
while Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gul) directly nour-
ishes the blood. Together they form a combination that can 
be used by itself to treat constipation due to dryness of the 
Intestines and blood deficiency failing to supply the sinews 
of the Intestines, thus interfering with normal Intestinal 
activity. The combination directs downward without injur-
ing the yang qi, while it warms and moistens without injur-
ing the yin fluids, thus it is particularly suitable for consti-
pation in the elderly where there is insufficiency of essence 
and blood. However, because it is rather warming, it is less 
suitable for those with yin deficiency and heat. 
~ WITH MORINDAE OFFICINALIS RADIX (ba ji tian); see 
page 782 
Comparisons 
~ Vs. CYNOMORn HERBA (suo yang) 
Both herbs tonify the yang, moisten the Intestines, and 
unblock the bowels. Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Med-
ica notes that "Cynomorii Herba (suo yang) basically is the 
same type [of herb] as Cistanches Herba (rou cong r6ng): 
sweet, salty, and warm by nature. It moistens dryness, and 
nourishes the sinews." However, Cistanches Herba (rou 
cong r6ng) is better able to augment the essence and blood, 
and is thus better suited than Cynomorii Herba (suo yang) 
to treat women's infertility; but it is less warming of the 
Kidney yang. Cynomorii Herba (suo yang) also has a stron-
ger ability to nourish the sinews and treat male impotence, 
and is often used for this purpose, as well as atrophy of the 
sinews and bones.

Traditional Contraindications 
"Contraindicated for diarrhea, and for heat within the 
Kidneys leading to excessive sexual excitement and in-
stability of the essence." (Commentary on the Divine Hus-
bandman's Classic of Materia Medica) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Because the effects of this herb are moderate and slow, 
some take its name ( fi ~ c6ng r6ng) to have the meaning of 
the same characters without the grass classifier (1ft:$. c6ng 
r6ng), which means 'unhurried'. 
~ WINE-PREPARED CISTANCHE Offi fi ~ jiu c6ng r6ng) 
The herb is mixed with yellow rice wine, left covered briefly 
as the wine is absorbed, then double-boiled until the wine 
is totally absorbed. The color will then have changed from 
brown to black, with a wine-like aroma, and its ability to 
tonify the Kidney yang will have substantially increased. It 
is, however, slightly less moistening for the Intestines.
