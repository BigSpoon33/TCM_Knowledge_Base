## 📖 Overview

Acrid, sweet, and very cold, Gypsum fibrosum (Shí Gāo) enters the Lung and Stomach channels. It is very cooling and dispersing; within its ability to drain fire is a tendency to clear and release. In the exterior, it releases heat from the muscle layer, and in the interior, it clears fire and heat from excess from the qi level of the Lungs and Stomach. Reducing heat is crucial for the preservation of fluids, and it is no accident that intense thirst is a signal for the use of Gypsum fibrosum (Shí Gāo), as is the high fever with absence of chills and the large, strong pulse.

Other conditions for which this mineral is an excellent choice include Lung heat leading to severe cough and wheezing, and Stomach fire causing headache, toothache, bleeding gums, or tooth abscess. If used with herbs that cool heat in the blood, Gypsum fibrosum (Shí Gāo) can also treat symptoms of heat in the qi and blood such as rashes, delirium, and muddled consciousness.

*Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica* elaborates:

The acrid flavor of Gypsum fibrosum can release the muscle layer, its sweetness can moderate heat, its great coldness side by side with these sweet and acrid properties mean that it can expel intense heat. ... This herb can disperse pathogenic heat from the yang brightness, and direct phlegm-heat downward in the greater yang; thus, it is a major herb in each case.

Concern about the powerful clinical effects of Gypsum fibrosum (Shí Gāo) has been shared by novice herbal physicians throughout the ages, but more experienced voices counsel that a precise knowledge of one's tools followed by resolute application will achieve better results than a faltering attempt with insufficient but 'safe' doses, which often achieve nothing at all. *Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western* makes this point:

There is definitely no reason to think that unprepared Gypsum fibrosum, when used to treat externally contracted disorders with heat from excess, will harm people. When used courageously, there is also no reason that it will not reduce heat.

The author of that book, Zhang Xi-Chun, argues that Gypsum fibrosum (Shí Gāo) actually does not have the extremely cold properties of Coptidis Rhizoma (Huang Lian), Phellodendri Cortex (Huang Bai), or Gentianae Radix (Long Dan Cao), yet its ability to reduce heat surpasses these herbs. He bases his argument on a statement in the *Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica* that Gypsum fibrosum (Shí Gāo) can be used for postpartum women with externally-contracted heat, while the other bitter, cold herbs noted here are contraindicated. "Gypsum fibrosum alone is not forbidden" in that context, he points out, and therefore cannot be extremely cold. Zhang notes that the cooling action of these bitter, cold herbs derives from cold overcoming heat, whereas Gypsum fibrosum (Shí Gāo) reduces heat by driving it out of the body.

Zhang also suggests that a decoction containing Gypsum fibrosum (Shí Gāo) be consumed quite slowly: "You want its therapeutic power to remain in the upper and middle burners, and [not let] the coldness encroach upon the lower [burner], causing loose stools or diarrhea."

Regarding the question of whether Gypsum fibrosum (Shí Gāo) should be decocted prior the other herbs in a decoction, some in China have found that there is an inverse relationship between the solubility of its major constituents and the decocting temperature. There is some evidence that only slight simmering at 60°C gives the best result. This is in line with the methods described in *Discussion of Cold Damage*, where none of the seven formulas containing Gypsum fibrosum (Shí Gāo) specify that it be added before the other herbs.

- **Clears heat and drains fire:** For high fever without chills, irritability, intense thirst, profuse sweating, a flooding, big pulse, and red tongue with yellow coating. This condition is one of excess in the qi level of the four levels of disease, or the yang brightness channel stage of the six stages of disease.
    - **With Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (Zhi Mu):** For high fever due to externally-contracted heat disorder and heat from excess in the yang brightness channel stage (or analogous qi level) with irritability and extreme thirst, as in White Tiger Decoction (Bai Hu Tang).
    - **With Lophatheri Herba (Dan Zhu Ye):** For either lingering fever as a sequelae of febrile disease, or cough with fever in children, as in Lophatherus and Gypsum Decoction (Zhu Ye Shi Gao Tang).
    - **With Bubali Cornu (Shui Niu Jiao) and Scrophulariae Radix (Xuan Shen):** For epidemic damp-heat toxin presenting with such symptoms as high fever, loss of consciousness, nosebleed, and rash, as in Transform Maculae Decoction (Hua Ban Tang).
- **Clears heat from excess from the Lungs:** For cough and wheezing with fever and thick, viscous sputum.
    - **With Ephedrae Herba (Ma Huang):** For cough with nasal flaring due to externally-contracted heat obstructing the Lungs, as in Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Gypsum, and Licorice Decoction (Ma Xing Shi Gan Tang).
    - **With Lonicerae Flos (Jin Yin Hua) and Houttuyniae Herba (Yu Xing Cao):** For heat toxin in the Lungs.
- **Clears blazing Stomach fire:** For headache, toothache, or swollen and painful gums due to Stomach fire.
    - **With Asari Radix et Rhizoma (Xi Xin):** For toothache and swelling gums due to blazing Stomach fire.
    - **With Rehmanniae Radix Preparata (Shu Di Huang):** For headache, toothache, and thirst due to raging fire caused by devastated yin, as in Jade Woman Decoction (Yu Nu Jian). Substitute Rehmanniae Radix (Sheng Di Huang) if there is fire from excess and injured fluids.
    - **With Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparata (Ban Xia) and Bambusae Caulis in Taeniam (Zhu Ru):** For nausea and vomiting from Stomach heat.
- **For eczema, burns, and ulcerated sores:** Usually applied topically in powdered form after being calcined and mixed with other herbs. May also be taken internally for these conditions.
    - **With Phellodendri Cortex (Huang Bai):** For burns and eczema; apply topically. Here Gypsum fibrosum preparatum (Duan Shi Gao) is used.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in cases of cold from deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach, or fever from yin deficiency.
- Fundamentally, it is an important herb for releasing heat from excess, expelling summerheat, alleviating thirst, and eliminating irritability.
- It readily makes the Stomach cold.
- Warm and febrile disorders generally involve the yang brightness.
- If there is headache, generalized aching of the bones, yet no thirst or desire to drink, then the pathogen is in the greater yang and has not transferred to the yang brightness, and Gypsum fibrosum should not be used (Shí Gāo).
- After seven or eight days, when the pathogen has already clumped internally and there are parched stools with alternating chills and fever, this requires purging - do not use Gypsum fibrosum.
- For summerheat with diarrhea due to dampness and Spleen and Stomach weakness, do not use it (Shí Gāo).
- It should likewise not be used for malaria-like disorders which are not in the yang brightness and do not involve thirst. (*Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica*)
