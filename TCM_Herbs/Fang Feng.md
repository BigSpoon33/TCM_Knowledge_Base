## 📖 Overview

Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng) expels wind, but has a moderate, gentle nature, slightly warm but not parching, sweet and not at all harsh. It is known as the most moist of the wind herbs, although this simply indicates that it is less drying than most wind-expelling herbs. It can be used for all wind patterns, hot or cold, upper or lower body, exterior or interior. This ability to reach the deeper interior levels of the body to track down and expel wind is one of its special characteristics.

By expelling wind it treats headaches, general body aches, and spasms, although its ability to relieve muscular tetany is too weak for it to serve as a chief herb for this problem. In the treatment of wind-damp painful obstruction, for which it is particularly appropriate when the patient is weak or blood deficient, it can eliminate wind-dampness. This is because its effects are less drying than many other herbs used in the treatment of painful obstruction.

Another valued quality of Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng) is its ability to relieve Intestinal wind, reduce tenesmus, and reduce diarrhea. According to Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, it lifts the yang qi and stops Intestinal wind and bleeding from the bowels. The Medical Discourses of [Zhang] Yu-Ren concurs, saying it raises the Spleen yang and alleviates diarrhea.

In New Compilation of Materia Medica, Chen Shi-Duo observes:

Surprisingly, Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng) can be used when pathogenic wind is not present; if used with Astragali Radix (huang qi) it can shut out wind from entering the skin. However, this combination cannot be used once the wind pathogen has already entered. There is always a deep significance when the ancients name something; by pondering the name, one obtains comprehension.

Chen here is referring to the literal Chinese meaning of fang feng (the herb's name): to guard against wind.
