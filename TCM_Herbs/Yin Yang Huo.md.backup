## 📖 Overview

The sweet warmth of Epimedii Herba (*yin yang huo*) tonifies the fire at the gate of vitality and fortifies the Kidney yang, while its acrid warmth expels wind-dampness. Tonification of the Kidney yang enables it to treat impotence, spermatorrhea, and urinary frequency. Internally, reinforcement of the Kidney yang strengthens the bones, while externally, wind-dampness is dispersed so that painful obstruction is unblocked. Thus, not only are these pathogens expelled, but the injury done by them is repaired.

Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi says that it treats "every type of wind-cold consumptive qi, spasms and contractures of the sinews and bones, loss of feeling in the four extremities; and it tonifies the lower back and knees." Many materia medica texts record that it is good in wine, and that Dioscoreae Rhizoma (*shan yao*) enhances its functions.

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica also says that it can be used as a wash for sores around the genitals: "Acrid-drying can expel damp-heat, in this it is like Cnidii Fructus (*she chuang zi*) as a wash for itchy sores."

The Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica states that the herb is "acrid, cold, governs impotence, infertility, pain in the penis, facilitates urination, augments the power of qi, strengthens resolve." Most materia medica texts since that time have objected to its characterization as a cold herb. For example, Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica says that its "temperature is warm and it is non-toxic. The Divine Husbandman's statement that it is cold is incorrect." Li Shi Zhen, in the Grand Materia Medica, agrees:

Epimedii Herba (*yin yang huo*) is sweet in flavor and aromatic; its nature is warm, not cold [as the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica states]. It augments the essential qi, and is an herb of the arm and leg yang brightness, Triple Burner, and gate of vitality. It is appropriate for those with insufficiency of true yang.

The ability of this herb to assist the memory and resolve is recorded in many materia medica texts, including the Classic of Materia Medica, as well as the Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi, which says that it treats "old-age confusion and middle-age forgetfulness."

## ⚡ Functions & Actions

Tonifies the Kidneys and fortifies the yang: for patterns of Kidney yang deficiency with such symptoms as impotence, infertility, urinary frequency, forgetfulness, withdrawal, and painful cold lower back and knees.
    *   With Rehmanniae Radix preparata (*shu di huang*), Testudinis Plastri Colla (*gui ban jiao*), and Hominis Placenta (*zi he che*) for impotence accompanied by coldness of the lower back and legs.

    *   With Curculiginis Rhizoma (*xian mao*), Phellodendri Cortex (*huang bai*), and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*) for menopausal symptoms such as facial pallor, lower back pain, nocturia, menstrual irregularity, and dizziness from Liver and Kidney yin deficiency, as in Two-Immortal Decoction (*er xian tang*).
    *   With Schisandrae Fructus (*wu wei zi*), Lycii Fructus (*gou qi zi*), and Astragali complanati Semen (*sha yuan zi*) for impotence and infertility associated with Kidney deficiency.
*   Dispels wind-cold-dampness and warms and unblocks the flow of yang qi: for wind-cold-damp painful obstruction with such symptoms as spasms or cramps in the hands and feet, joint pain, and numbness in the extremities. Also used for the contractures, numbness, or hemiplegia following wind-stroke.
    *   With Taxilli Herba (*sang ji sheng*) for painful obstruction, especially paralysis and pain of the lower extremities, or muscular contracture and numbness of the extremities.
    *   With Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (*qiang huo*), Saposhnikoviae Radix (*fang feng*), and Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (*zhi fu zi*) for wind-cold-damp painful obstruction with joint pain and difficulty in movement.
