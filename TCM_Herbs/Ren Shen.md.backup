## 📖 Overview

Ginseng Radix (ren shen) significantly tonifies the primal qi, and the qi of all the organs, especially that of the Lungs and Spleen. It generates fluids, quiets the spirit, and strengthens the resolve. Through its tonification of qi, it generates blood, encourages blood flow, and controls bleeding. It is both more powerful and faster acting than similar herbs such as Codonopsis Radix (dang shen) or Pseudostellariae Radix (tai zi shen), and is irreplaceable when disorders are severe or in need of immediate relief, such as patterns of abandonment or profuse hemorrhage, as in the formula Unaccompanied Ginseng Decoction (du shen tang).

In Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica, Miao Xi-Yong states that it "can revive the yang qi when it has sagged and been severed-it augments the true qi, so that the five organs are each tonified."

The Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica notes that it:

governs tonification of the five organs, quiets the consciousness, settles the ethereal soul and the corporeal soul, arrests palpitations with anxiety, expels pathogenic qi, brightens the eyes, opens the Heart and strengthens the resolve.

In Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western, Zhang Xi-Chun observes:

The reason for all of these actions is nothing but an ample sufficiency of qi and blood, so that each yin and yang organ, and each orifice, and each joint obtains its proper nourishment, naturally affecting all of the above.

With regard to its ability to tonify the blood, this is explained by Li Gao in Discussion of the Spleen and Stomach:

How can sweetness and warmth generate blood, when this is not a blood herb? The answer is in [Zhang] Zhong-Jing's method of using Ginseng Radix (ren shen) to tonify [the yang] when blood is deficient: when the yang flourishes it can then generate yin blood.

Records of Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica emphasizes the underlying harmonious nature of this herb:

Of all [medicinal] substances receiving mixed praise and blame, Ginseng Radix (ren shen) is the epitome: those who advocate tonification usually praise it, those who advocate attack generally criticize it. Those who praise it also champion either its ability to tonify the yang or to tonify the yin, without knowing that both [extreme positions] are false. Xu Da-Chun and Zou Shu each have gained [understanding of] the nature and use of this substance. Xu states that [it] 'incorporates the pure quintessential qi of heaven and earth. It tonifies qi without the drawback of overly forceful drying, and also enters the yin aspect.' Zou says 'The qi of the five yin organs is yang by virtue of its transportive and transformative [functions], but yin by virtue of conserving without draining. Ginseng Radix (ren shen) uses both transformation and conservation; moreover, its color is yellow, its flavor is sweet, it is cooling, and moistening in texture-totally congruous with the middle earth Spleen's virtue of conserving. This is how it enters the postnatal, but increases the congenital.

## ⚡ Functions & Actions

- **Powerfully tonifies the primal qi:** for extreme collapse of the qi or abandoned conditions that manifest in shallow breathing, shortness of breath, cold limbs, profuse sweating, and a pulse so minute or weak that it is almost imperceptible. This condition can occur after loss of blood, overly profuse sweating, or other problems related to severe fluid loss; in such cases, this herb can be used by itself.
  - With Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi) for profuse sweating, ice-cold extremities, shortness of breath, and other symptoms associated with collapsed qi and devastated yang, as in Ginseng and Aconite Accessory Root Decoction (shen fu tang).
  - With Schisandrae Fructus (wu wei zi) and Ophiopogonis Radix (mai men dong) for shortness of breath and spontaneous sweating associated with qi and yin deficiency, most commonly secondary to injury from heat, as in Generate the Pulse Powder (sheng mai san).
  - With Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di huang) for severe qi and blood deficiency due to blood loss.

- **Strengthens the Spleen and tonifies the Stomach:** for lethargy, lack of appetite, chest and abdominal distention, chronic diarrhea, and, in severe cases, prolapse of the stomach, uterus, or rectum.
  - With Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu) and Poria (fu ling) for symptoms such as anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting, focal distention of the abdomen, and fatigue due to Spleen and Stomach qi deficiency, as in Four-Gentleman Decoction (si jun zi tang) and Ginseng, Poria, and White Atractylodes Powder (shen ling bai zhu san).
  - With Astragali Radix (huang qi) and Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) for qi deficiency with various types of prolapse due to sinking of the clear yang, as in Tonify the Middle and Augment the Qi Decoction (bu zhong yi qi tang).

- **Tonifies the Lungs and augments the qi:** for wheezing, shortness of breath, and labored breathing on exertion caused by Lung qi deficiency. There is usually also a concurrent failure of the Kidneys to grasp the qi.
  - With Gecko (ge jie) and Juglandis Semen (he tao ren) for wheezing due to deficient Kidneys being unable to grasp the qi, as in Ginseng and Gecko Powder (ren shen ge jie san) and Ginseng and Walnut Decoction (ren shen hu tao tang).
  - With Farfarae Flos (kuan dong hua) and Asteris Radix (zi wan) for chronic cough due to Lung qi deficiency.

- **Generates fluids and stops thirst:** for wasting and thirsting disorder, as well as cases when the qi and fluids have been injured by high fever and profuse sweating. Its use here is based on the fact that the distribution of fluids depends on the proper functioning of qi.
  - With Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mu) for heat injuring both the qi and the fluids manifesting in fever, irritability, intense thirst, and profuse sweating, as in White Tiger plus Ginseng Decoction (bai hu jia ren shen tang).
  - With Trichosanthis Radix (tian hua fen) and Asparagi Radix (tian men dong) for wasting and thirsting disorder marked by an intense, unquenchable thirst.

- **Benefits the Heart qi and calms the spirit:** for palpitations with anxiety, insomnia, forgetfulness, and restlessness due to qi and blood deficiency.
  - With Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui), Longan Arillus (long yan rou), and Polygalae Radix (yuan zhi) for palpitations, shortness of breath, reduced appetite, and insomnia due to Heart and Spleen deficiency, as in Restore the Spleen Decoction (gui pi tang).
  - With Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) and Platycladi Semen (bai zi ren) for insomnia due to Heart and Kidney insufficiency, as in Emperor of Heaven's Special Pill to Tonify the Heart (tian wang bu xin dan).

- **Miscellaneous adjunctive effect:** because it strongly tonifies the primal qi, which underlies and supports all the qi activities of the body, this herb is used in a wide variety of situations where a stronger primal qi will indirectly aid in their resolution.
  - With Perillae Folium (zi su ye) for externally-contracted wind-cold in cases of qi deficiency, as in Ginseng and Perilla Leaf Decoction (shen su yin).
  - With Cervi Cornu pantotrichum (lu rong) and Psoraleae Fructus (bu gu zhi), prepared in a variety of alcoholic beverages, to treat impotence from Kidney yang deficiency.
