## 📖 Overview

Sweet, warm, and astringent, the most notable properties of Astragali Complanati Semen (沙苑子 - shā yuàn zi) are to tonify the Liver and Kidneys, secure the essence, and improve the vision. Although warming, it is considered rather moistening and harmonious in its actions; several materia medica texts remark that the shape of the seeds resembles goat kidneys. Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica says that it

*directs downward by nature, and tonifies, augmenting the Kidneys and treating pain in the lower back, and is an important herb in the treatment of loss of essence due to consumptive deficiency. It is best able to secure the essence...it is beautiful and sweet as a tea substitute that benefits people.*

Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica adds that it "tonifies the Kidneys, strengthens the yin, augments the essence, and brightens the eyes; treats vaginal discharge." Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica points out that

*Astragali Complanati Semen (沙苑子 - shā yuàn zi) is an herb that tonifies the Kidneys and secures the essence. It has a light aroma that nourishes the Liver, brightens the eyes, and moistens to benefit people. Tonifying the Kidneys, securing the essence, strengthening yang to beget children, neither violent nor drying, and furthermore stopping terminal dribbling of urine - this is a gentle, soft, harmonious, and moist remedy.*
