## 📖 Overview

Bitter, sweet, cold, and moistening, Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*) primarily acts through the Lung, Stomach, and Kidney channels. Bitter and cold, it drains fire, while its sweet, cold, and moistening qualities enrich the yin and moisten what is dry. This clearing and moistening quality is the principal advantage of Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*): in the upper burner it clears Lung heat, in the middle burner it cools the Stomach, and in the lower burner it drains ministerial fire, while also enriching the yin of the Kidneys, Lungs, and Stomach. Therefore, it can be used in situations of both excess and deficiency when heat has dried the yin fluids, such as wasting and thirsting disorder. Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica explains that Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*) "governs wasting and thirsting, heat in the middle, expels pathogenic qi, and, by driving water downward, treats floating edema of the limbs...tonifies insufficiency and benefits the qi." ("Heat in the middle" refers to Stomach yin deficiency.) The pathogenic qi that Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*) expels is pathogenic heat that has entered the body, particularly at the yang brightness stage. This herb drives water downward because its cold, moistening qualities drain the Spleen.
Grand Materia Medica explains why Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*) can act on both the Lungs and on the Kidneys:

When the Kidneys suffer dryness, acrid [substances] should be imbibed to moisten them; when the Lungs suffer rebellion [upward], bitter [substances] should be imbibed to drain them. Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*) is acrid, bitter, and cold, so that below, it moistens Kidney dryness and enriches yin; above, it clears Lung metal and drains fire.

It acts at the qi level of both channels. ... To lead into the channel above, fry with wine then bake it dry; to move it downward, soak in salt water then bake.
In an interesting further comment, Li Shi-Zhen notes that "Phellodendri Cortex (*huang bai*) acts at the blood level of the Kidneys, which is why the two herbs should be used together."

Zhang Xi-Chun points out that "Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*) is not intrinsically extremely cold, nor is it very bitter." He tasted and compared Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*) with an equal amount of Astragali Radix (*huang qi*) and found little perceptible difference in temperature sensations. Then he boiled Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*) and Glycyrrhizae Radix (*gan cao*) together, and found the result to be mainly sweet:

Thus, we know that Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*) is neither extremely cold nor extremely bitter. However, it does have copious fluid with which to enrich yin. Some say that Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*) can only cool heat, and is unable to enrich yin: this is viewing Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*) too superficially. When I treat conditions of heat from excess with a rapid pulse, I always use Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*). Formulas which use Astragali Radix (*huang qi*) to tonify qi can be too hot for some patients; use Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (*zhi mu*) as a supporting herb. Its fluids, however, lubricate the Intestines, and so it should not be used if the stools are loose.

## ⚡ Functions & Actions

- Clears heat and drains fire: for high fever, irritability, thirst, and a rapid, flooding pulse in patterns of heat from excess in the Lungs and Stomach. Also for cough due to heat in the Lungs with expectoration of thick, yellow sputum.
- With Phellodendri Cortex (*huang bai*) to synergistically clear heat and drain fire. This combination is also used for steaming bone disorder from yin deficiency with night sweats, dizziness, and vertigo, as in the formulas Anemarrhena, Phellodendron, and Rehmannia Pill (*zhi bai di huang wan*) and Great Tonify the Yin Pill (*da bu yin wan*).
- Add Cinnamomi Cortex (*rou gui*) for damp-heat smoldering in the lower burner causing obstruction and dysfunction of Bladder qi with resulting urinary retention and afternoon fevers.
- With Coptidis Rhizoma (*huang lian*) for blazing Stomach fire with intense hunger and thirst, dry stools, dry, yellow tongue coating, and a slippery, rapid pulse.
- With Fritillariae thunbergii Bulbus (*zhe bei mu*) for cough due to heat in the Lungs with expectoration of thick, yellow sputum, as in Fritillaria and Anemarrhena Powder (*er mu san*).
- With Scrophulariae Radix (*xuan shen*) and Rehmanniae Radix (*sheng di huang*) for ulcers of the oral cavity.
- Enriches the yin and moistens dryness: for exhaustion or deficiency of Lung and Kidney yin with such heat signs as night sweats, steaming bone disorder, irritability, afternoon or low-grade fevers, heat in the five centers, and bleeding gums. Also for such Kidney heat signs as spermatorrhea, nocturnal emissions, and abnormally elevated sex drive.
- With Trionycis Carapax (*bie jia*) for steaming bone disorder.
- Generates fluids and clears heat: for oral ulcers and inflammation due to yin deficiency, and for wasting and thirsting disorder.
- With Trichosanthis Radix (*tian hua fen*) and Ophiopogonis Radix (*mai men dong*) for thirst and irritability due to Lung and Stomach dryness.
- With Dioscoreae Rhizoma (*shan yao*), Astragali Radix (*huang qi*), and Schisandrae Fructus (*wu wei zi*) for wasting and thirsting disorder, as in Jade Fluid Decoction (*yu ye tang*).
- Ameliorates the dryness of tonifying or warming substances: for circumstances when tonifying herbs, such as Astragali Radix (*huang qi*), or warming herbs, such as Cinnamomi Ramulus (*gui zhi*) and Aconiti Radix Lateralis Preparata (*fu zi*), are used, but there is concern that they not be too drying. See, e.g., the formulas Raise the Sinking Decoction (*sheng xian tang*) and Cinnamon Twig, Peony, and Anemarrhena Decoction (*gui zhi shao yao zhi mu tang*).
