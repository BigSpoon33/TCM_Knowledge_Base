## 📖 Overview

Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) is bitter, cold, and directs qi downward. It is best for draining fire from excess affecting the Kidneys, and clearing lower burner damp-heat. It is often used in the treatment of steaming bones and consumptive heat, night sweats, and spermatorrhea. However, Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) is also effective for jaundice, hot-type dysenteric disorders resulting from damp-heat, vaginal discharge, turbid painful urinary dribbling, hemorrhoids, and hematuria.

The Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica says that Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) "controls clumped heat in the organs, Stomach and Intestines, jaundice, and hemorrhoids; alleviates diarrhea and dysenteric disorders, gynecological red-and-white discharge, and ulceration of the vulva." In his writings, Zhu Dan-Xi implied that Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) tonified the Kidney yin, and this statement still appears in the literature from time to time, despite the warnings of later commentators such as Zhang Jie-Bin:

When water is dried up, how could bitterness tonify? Yin deficiency, exhaustion of water, directing it downward it becomes ever more devastated, extinguishing the primal yang; there is nothing more extreme than this herb. If water is not dried, but fire is abundant, then using it to pull the fuel from beneath the stove is enough; once the water is spent and the dryness becomes heat, using this to tonify yin is truly difficult ... it should not be regarded as a tonifying herb!

The Materia Medica of Combinations describes how Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) "tonifies" the yin, and then how it does not:

[It] tonifies water by its ability to clear the yin-fire blazing upward from below: when the fire is cleared, water is fortified and congeals [as is normal]-this is tonifying without tonifying. Note that this pathogenic heat in the midst of yin is not originally the true fire of the gate of vitality, and so there is no harm in using bitter, cold herbs to expel it. If [however] the true water of the Kidneys is insufficient so that the true fire floats deficiently upward, then Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) and Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di huang) must be used to enrich the Kidneys. When the water is sufficient, fire will naturally return to its place of containment. If Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mu) and Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) are mistakenly used, as the water becomes dried [by their bitterness], the fire will blaze even higher, and contrary to one's intention, yang will become separated from yin and fly away. This is irremediable.
