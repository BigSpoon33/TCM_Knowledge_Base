## 📖 Overview

Sweet, warm, moist, and richly tonifying, *Rehmanniae Radix Preparata* (*shu di huang*) enters the Liver, Kidney, and Heart channels to tonify the blood, enrich the yin, generate essence, and augment the marrow. Black, heavy, and utterly still in nature, it embodies the qualities of deep essence, stored potential, the body's deepest resource available for the production of functional yin, blood, and primal qi. It is the primary herb for tonifying the Liver and Kidneys and nurturing and stabilizing the primal root. It is often used to treat patterns of insufficient Kidney yin and Liver and Heart blood deficiency, characterized by such symptoms as weakness of the lower back and legs, emaciation, spermatorrhea, tinnitus, dizziness, premature greying of the hair, and gynecological disorders due to yin or blood deficiency. Essentials of the Materia Medica notes that it "tonifies the Liver and Kidneys, nourishes the blood, enriches the yin, and is a superior herb for tonifying the blood."

Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica explains the effect of its various qualities:

When the spirit scatters due to deficient yin, only the conserving quality of *Rehmanniae Radix Preparata* (*shu di huang*) will gather it: conservation controls scattering.

When fire ascends due to deficient yin, only the heaviness of *Rehmanniae Radix Preparata* (*shu di huang*) will direct it downward: heaviness controls ascent.

When there is restless movement due to deficient yin, only the stillness of *Rehmanniae Radix Preparata* (*shu di huang*) will suppress it: stillness controls movement.

When there is hardness and tension due to deficient yin, only the sweetness of *Rehmanniae Radix Preparata* (*shu di huang*) will relax it: [sweetness moderates and] relaxation controls tension.

Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances observes that when it is mixed with wine then steamed until cooked, its bitter flavor turns sweet, its cool nature turns warm, and it specifically enters the Liver organ to tonify the blood. It also warms the Gallbladder and augments the Heart blood, but even more it tonifies the Kidney water. Whenever there is internal injury or insufficiency, excessive mental or emotional activity that exhausts the spirit, continual worry that injures the blood, and unleashed desire that consumes the essence; or in order to adjust menstruation, pregnancy, and the postpartum period, one should use *Rehmanniae Radix Preparata* (*shu di huang*).

Zhang Hao-Gu notes that this herb "governs blurry vision [that occurs] when one wants to rise from a seated position." It can also be used for uterine bleeding caused by injury to the Penetrating and Conception vessels; charred cooked rehmannia is particularly appropriate for this indication.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
This is a very cloying and rich substance that readily leads to stagnation of dampness and impedes digestion. It is contraindicated in those with qi stagnation and profuse phlegm, fullness, and pain in the abdomen, reduced appetite, and diarrhea. See below for toxicity.

Traditional Contraindications

"Do not allow it to contact bronze or iron implements, or it will cause the Kidneys to waste, whiten the hair, and injure the nutritive and protective levels." (Grandfather Lei's Discussion of Herb Preparation)

"Because it can obstruct the diaphragm in those with qi constraint, one should deliberate before using it [in those cases]." (Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica)

Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica explains that, despite its gentle warmth, all forms of rehmannia are relatively cool and have a cloying effect on the diaphragm, so that in cases of postpartum loss of appetite, or diarrhea, even though there may be fever, or pain due to retained lochia, it cannot be used-mistaken use will cause ceaseless diarrhea; whenever the diaphragm area has excessive phlegm and the movement of the qi dynamic is poor such that ascent and descent are plugged, herbs should unblock rather than cause stagnation, so in these cases, rehmannia is forbidden in decoctions or pills. If it absolutely must be used, then a bit of cinnamon heart [a form of *Cinnamomi Cortex* (rou gui)] can be added. In a phlegm pattern, if it must be used and cannot be done without, then fry it with ginger juice.
