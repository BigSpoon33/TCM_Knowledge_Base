## 📖 Overview

Acrid, bitter, warm, and drying, aromatically dredging and dispersing, Atractylodis Rhizoma (cang zhu) dries Spleen and Stomach dampness, strengthens and harmonizes the middle burner, while dispersing externally-contracted wind-cold, venting and releasing the exterior, and inducing sweating. *Rectification of the Meaning of the Materia Medica* notes that "Its aroma clears away filth, and prevails over seasonal abnormal qi, thus it is often used for seasonal epidemic disorders."

The Spleen prefers warmth and dryness, and is averse to dampness. Atractylodis Rhizoma (cang zhu) matches this profile perfectly by virtue of its warm and aromatic dryness. Atractylodis Rhizoma (cang zhu) can therefore be used whenever turbid dampness has encumbered the Spleen, impairing its transportive function, and leading to such symptoms as epigastric fullness and nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, edema, and abdominal distention and fullness. It is also appropriate for externally-contracted cold-dampness causing headache, heavy lethargy, aching of the limbs and joints, chills and fever without sweating; and for wind-damp painful obstruction when dampness is predominant.

*Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances* provides a detailed description of this herb's actions:

It governs the treatment of dampness in the three sections [of the body]: Dampness in the upper burner readily generates phlegm-dampness; this [herb] is used to dry dampness and mobilize phlegm. Dampness in the middle burner stagnates qi and causes diarrhea; this is used to ease the middle and strengthen the Spleen. Dampness in the lower burner atrophies and weakens the legs and knees; this is used with Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) to treat the atrophy, helping the legs and knees regain power.

In *Rectification of the Meaning of the Materia Medica*, Zhang Shan-Lei describes a wide range of symptoms associated with dampness and the constrained transportive functions of the Spleen within the scope of Atractylodis Rhizoma (cang zhu). He concludes by saying that "As long as the tongue coating is white, thick, turbid, and greasy, [this] is the single most requisite herb."

Finally, Atractylodis Rhizoma (cang zhu) is noted in a number of materia medica texts for its efficacy in treating night blindness. This may, however, be due to the traditional pairing of this herb with pig or goat liver when treating this condition.

## ⚡ Functions & Actions

- Strongly dries dampness and strengthens the Spleen: for dampness obstructing the middle burner and blocking the transportive and transformative functions of the Spleen.
- Symptoms include reduced appetite, diarrhea, epigastric distention and pressure, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and a thick, greasy tongue coating.
- With Magnoliae officinalis Cortex (hou po) and Citri reticulatae Pericarpium (chen pi) for fatigue, epigastric fullness and distention, reduced appetite, vomiting and/or diarrhea with a turbid, greasy tongue coating due to dampness obstructing the middle burner, as in Calm the Stomach Powder (ping wei san).
- With Cyperi Rhizoma (xiang fu) for distention, discomfort, and pain in the chest, epigastrium, and abdomen due to qi obstruction and dampness.
- With Lonicerae Flos (jin yin hua) for diarrhea, especially when due to summerheat with dampness.
- With Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao) for damp-warmth characterized by fever, profuse sweating, and generalized body aches.
- Dry-fired and ground into a powder, this herb serves as a base for treating diarrhea in children due to dampness.
    - Add Crataegi Fructus (shan zha) for food stagnation.
    - Add Talcum (hua shi) for damp-heat.
    - Add Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jiang) for cold from deficiency.
- Induces sweating and dispels wind-dampness: for exterior conditions due to wind-cold-dampness as well as wind dampness. Symptoms include chills, fever, headache, body aches, and nasal congestion.
    - With Chuanxiong Rhizoma (chuan xiong), Angelicae dahuricae Radix (bai zhi), and Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qiang huo) for exterior wind-cold-dampness, as in Nine-Herb Decoction with Notopterygium (jiu wei qiang huo tang).
    - With Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mu) for the early stages of damp-heat when dampness and heat are of equal strength. This is marked by fevers that fail to recede, focal distention in the chest, heavy lethargy, and thirst with no desire to drink. See White Tiger plus Atractylodis Decoction (bai hu jia cang zhu tang).
    - With Coicis Semen (yi yi ren) for damp-predominant painful obstruction.
- Clears dampness from the lower burner: for damp-heat pouring downward (as in leg qi and some forms of atrophy disorders), vaginal discharge, and swollen, sore joints. Although this herb is warm, it is very effective for drying dampness; when combined with herbs that clear heat, it is used for damp-heat disorders.
    - With Phellodendri Cortex (huang bai) for pain, swelling, and weakness of the lower extremities or skin lesions due to wind-dampness. Used for atrophy disorder, vaginal discharge, and damp sores, among other problems, as in Two-Marvel Powder (er miao san).
- Improves the vision: for night blindness or diminished vision with a rough sensation in the eyes.
    - With Sesami Semen nigrum (hei zhi ma) for cataracts, glaucoma, and night blindness.
