Additional product information 
Owing to the different plants that are used as this herb, and the 
different processing methods, many different products can be 
identified. Moreover, the relationships among the different names 
and species are not entirely clear. 
The best quality Oendrobium nobile, or golden hairpin dendrobium 
~~~,t; M jfn chiii shf hU), comes from Jingxi in Guangxi province. 
The best quality Oendrobium chrysanthum, or yellow herb dendro-
bium (* 1f-,t; M huang cao shf hU), comes from Huoshan in Anhui 
province. And the best quality earring dendrobium ( Jf.Ji,t; M er 
huan shf hu) comes from Laohekou in Hubei province. 
Dendrobium spp. belongs to the orchidaceae family and is listed 
under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade 
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This 
appendix lists species that are not necessarily now threatened 
with extinction, but that may become so unless trade is closely 
controlled. It can therefore be difficult to obtain.

CAUTIONS AND 
CONTRAINDICATIONS 
6 
-
Because this herb is slighlty 
cold and moistening, it should not be used in those with 
a weak Spleen and Stomach, internal accumulation of 
phlegm-dampness, or loose stools due to cold. 
Actions & Indications 
• Nourishes the yin and moistens dryness: for Lung and 
Stomach dry-heat or yin deficiency patterns with cough, 
dry throat, irritability, and thirst. Also for steaming bone 
disorder and wasting and thirsting disorder with intense 
hunger and constipation. 
-
With Glehniae/ Adenophorae Radix (sha shen) and Op-
hiopogonis Radix (mai men dong) for dry cough, thirst, and 
other symptoms associated with injured fluids due to Lung 
and Stomach yin deficiency, as in Glehnia/ Adenophora and 
Ophiopogonis Decoction (sha shen mai men dong tang). 
- With Fritillariae cirrhosae Bulbus (chuan bei mu), Platy-
codi Radix (jie geng), and Asteris Radix (zi wan) for blazing 
pathogenic heat in the Lungs that has injured the Lung yin 
and led to phlegm-heat with coughing. 
-
With Rehmanniae Radix (sheng dl huang), Glehniae/ 
Adenophorae Radix (sha shen), and Ophiopogonis Radix 
(mai men dong) for depleted Stomach yin and fluids with 
irritability, thirst, a bright red tongue, and dry mouth, as in 
Benefit the Stomach Decoction (yl wei tang). 
• Extinguishes wind and softens and moistens the sinews: for 
wind generated by insufficient fluids leading to pain and 
spasms in the sinews. Also for dizziness caused by yin defi-
ciency and internal stirring of wind. In addition, because 
the herb is neither cloying nor tends to retain pathogenic 
influences, it is used in those with yin-deficient constitu-
tions in cases of externally-contracted wind-heat.

-
With Cynanchi atrati Radix (bai wei), Menthae haplo-
calycis Herba (bo he), and Sojae Semen preparatum (dcm 
dou chi) for externally-contracted wind-heat in those with 
yin-deficient constitutions, as in Modified Solomon's Seal 
Decoction (jia jian wei rui tang). 
-
With Codonopsis Radix (dang shen), Astragali Radix 
(huang qi), and Lycii Cortex (dl gii pi) for fevers due to 
deficiency of both the qi and yin marked by emaciation, 
lethargy, and increased sweating (both during the day and 
night). 
Commentary 
Sweet, juicy, soft, and moist, Polygonati odorati Rhizoma 
(yu zhu) is best for nourishing the yin, tonifying without 
being cloying, generating fluids injured by the processes 
of a febrile disease, and clearing and nourishing without 
retaining these pathogens or preventing their dispersal. 
Hence it is often used in the later stages of a febrile disease 
when the pathogen is weak, but the injury to the body's flu-
ids has already occurred. It can begin to restore the fluids, 
without preventing the final eradication of the pathogens, 
which more cloying yin tonics might do. It is used for thirst 
from Stomach yin deficiency, and dryness of the Lungs 
with chronic cough and thickened phlegm, or dry cough. 
It is considered to be a gentle, harmonious tonic which 
requires frequent consumption or larger doses for its 
effects to become noticeable. 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica observes 
that, "Although Polygonati odorati Rhizoma (yu zhu) is 
moistening, it does not injure the Spleen [or cause] diar-
rhea." 
The Materia Medica ofRi Hua-Zi says that it can 
eliminate irritable stifling sensations in the chest, stop 
thirst, moisten the Heart and Lungs, tonify those with the 
five types of consumption and seven types of [internal] 
injury, injuries from deficiency, lower back and leg pain, 
and hot type mania from heaven-sent [infectious] diseases. 
In Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing-
Cheng explains that it is 
moist in texture, cultivating and nourishing the Lung 
and Spleen yin-this is its best quality-but as for track-
ing down wind and dispersing heat, these are not areas in 
which a moist, sweet substance can be effective. If there is 
wind-heat or wind-warmth in a pattern of deficiency, then 
it can be used. 
Here, Zhang is referring to its role as the chief herb in the 
formula Polygonum Odoratum Decoction (wei rui tang) 
from Important Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces. 
Because that formula was designed for wind-heat disor-
ders, this could mislead practitioners into assuming that 
this herb itself strongly disperses wind-heat, which is not 
true. 
In Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, 
Zhang Shan-Lei points out an interesting fact about this 
herb: that it had been used to treat excessive heat due to 
mineral elixirs, which were once popular. According to 
Zhang, Beneficial Formulas from the Sages records that 
it was taken as a decoction when the consumption of 
Actinolitum (yang qi shi) led to feverish sensations: 
Because the ancients liked to take drying, hot mineral 
remedies, which they regarded as tonics, the ancient books 
often contain formulas that resolve toxicity due to min-
eral drugs. That Polygonati odorati Rhizoma (yu zhu) can 
resolve such toxicity demonstrates its coldness. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
);;> WITH GLEHNIAE/ADENOPHORAE RADIX (sha shen) and 
0PHIOPOGONIS RADIX (mai men dong) 
All three herbs strongly tonify the yin and generate fluids 
in the Lungs and Stomach. They are often used together 
when the Lung or Stomach yin has been injured following 
a qi-level or yang-brightness stage warm-heat pathogen 
disease with profuse sweating, particularly if a purge was 
used during a previous treatment. 
Comparisons 
);;> Vs. GLEHNIAE/ADENOPHORAE RADIX (sha shen) 
Both herbs enter the Lungs and Stomach, and both nourish 
the yin and generate fluids. They are often combined in the 
treatment of patterns involving Lung or Stomach yin defi-
ciency. However, Glehniae/Adenophorae Radix (sha shen) 
is more cooling, while Polygonati odorati Rhizoma (yu 
zhu) has a slower, more harmonious action that requires 
much larger doses (lSg) to achieve a noticeable effect. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"This is strongly forbidden in yin disorders with internal 
cold." (Reverence for the Origin of the Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
Overdosage may cause mild toxic reactions such as nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhea. There has been one reported case 
of an allergic reaction with generalized pruritus and red 
papular rashes. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "jade bamboo" 
In ancient times the name of this herb was luxuriant foli-
age (,l.~ wei rui). At present, because the larger, fleshier, 
semi-transparent rhizomes are considered superior, the 
names fat Solomon's seal (JlE.£.11' fei yu zhu) and clear 
Solomon's seal (BJ1 £.# mingyu zhu) are used.
