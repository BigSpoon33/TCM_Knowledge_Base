## üìñ Overview

The sweet warmth of Epimedii Herba (*yin yang huo*) tonifies the fire at the gate of vitality and fortifies the Kidney yang, while its acrid warmth expels wind-dampness. Tonification of the Kidney yang enables it to treat impotence, spermatorrhea, and urinary frequency. Internally, reinforcement of the Kidney yang strengthens the bones, while externally, wind-dampness is dispersed so that painful obstruction is unblocked. Thus, not only are these pathogens expelled, but the injury done by them is repaired.

Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi says that it treats "every type of wind-cold consumptive qi, spasms and contractures of the sinews and bones, loss of feeling in the four extremities; and it tonifies the lower back and knees." Many materia medica texts record that it is good in wine, and that Dioscoreae Rhizoma (*shan yao*) enhances its functions.

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica also says that it can be used as a wash for sores around the genitals: "Acrid-drying can expel damp-heat, in this it is like Cnidii Fructus (*she chuang zi*) as a wash for itchy sores."

The Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica states that the herb is "acrid, cold, governs impotence, infertility, pain in the penis, facilitates urination, augments the power of qi, strengthens resolve." Most materia medica texts since that time have objected to its characterization as a cold herb. For example, Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica says that its "temperature is warm and it is non-toxic. The Divine Husbandman's statement that it is cold is incorrect." Li Shi Zhen, in the Grand Materia Medica, agrees:

Epimedii Herba (*yin yang huo*) is sweet in flavor and aromatic; its nature is warm, not cold [as the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica states]. It augments the essential qi, and is an herb of the arm and leg yang brightness, Triple Burner, and gate of vitality. It is appropriate for those with insufficiency of true yang.

The ability of this herb to assist the memory and resolve is recorded in many materia medica texts, including the Classic of Materia Medica, as well as the Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi, which says that it treats "old-age confusion and middle-age forgetfulness."
