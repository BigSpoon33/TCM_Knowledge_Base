## 📖 Overview

Alismatis Rhizoma (泽泻 [zé xiè]) is sweet, bland, and cold. Coldness drains fire and overcomes heat, while blandness leaches and facilitates the removal of pathogenic water. As it enters the Kidney channel, it excels at draining Kidney channel ministerial fire; as it enters the Bladder channel, it also excels at leaching out dampness through the Bladder. With these properties, this herb can be used for a wide variety of disorders, including urinary difficulty with burning pain and dark urine due to the internal collection of damp heat; dizziness and vertigo due to water and thin mucus in the epigastrium; edema and diarrhea due to pathogenic water and dampness which have stagnated internally; and yin deficiency blazing fire leading to such symptoms as spermatorrhea and tinnitus.

*Penetrating the Mysteries of the Materia Medica* discusses the use of this herb in the treatment of spermatorrhea:

> For patients with spermatorrhea that is caused by the chaotic movement of ministerial fire, use Alismatis Rhizoma (泽泻 [zé xiè]) to cool it and the essence will be stored by itself. [If, however,] patients with spermatorrhea caused by deficient qi sinking downward are given Alismatis Rhizoma (泽泻 [zé xiè]), the essence will be made even more slippery!

Zhang Shan-Lei points out that one of the causes of the chaotic movement of ministerial fire is damp-heat in the lower burner:

> As to its use for stopping spermatorrhea, only if damp-heat collecting in the lower burner causes the ministerial fire to chaotically discharge its function of "dredging drainage" will the use of this substance be appropriate: by clearing damp-heat, it will allow the dragon minister to rest naturally.

Ministerial fire is supported by Kidney water, but expresses itself through the Liver, and by its warmth activates the transformation of fluids by the Triple Burner qi. This is the basis for Zhang's references to "dredging drainage" and "dragon minister." The function of ministerial fire relies on its steady, charcoal-like static nature, maintained in its proper location. If this bank of stable fire is agitated into flaring up by pathogenic lower burner damp-heat, one of the first results is spermatorrhea, as the quiescent essence is mobilized by the now pathogenic ministerial fire.

  - With Amomi Fructus (砂仁 [shā rén]) for urinary discomfort, scanty urine, and abdominal distention.
  - With Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (制半夏 [zhì bàn xià]) for epigastric and abdominal distention accompanied by scanty urine due to turbid dampness festering in the middle burner.
  - With Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (白术 [bái zhú]) for vertigo due to phlegm and thin mucus.
- **Settles ministerial fire in the Kidneys by draining damp heat from the lower burner:** spermatorrhea due to lower burner damp-heat disturbing the ministerial fire of the Kidneys.
  - With substances that tonify the Kidneys to prevent the appearance of Kidney fire as a side effect of tonification.
