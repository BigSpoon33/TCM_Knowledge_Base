Commentary 
Acrid, sweet, and warming, the best effects of Allii tuberosi 
Semen (jiu cai zi) are to reinforce the yang and secure the 
essence, while also warmly tonifying the Liver and Kidneys 
and serving to contain fluid loss from the urethra and 
vagina. The Materia Medica ofRi Hua-Zi says that it warms 
the lower back and knees. The Grand Materia Medica notes 
that it tonifies the Liver and the gate of vitality, and treats 
urinary frequency, incontinence, and vaginal discharge. 
Records of Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica 
explains one aspect of its functioning in some detail: 
Miscellaneous Records [of Famous Physicians) says that 
[it] governs nocturnal emissions and loss of essence in 
the urine. Zou very appropriately refers to the passage 
from Basic Questions [Chapter 3) which says 'yin stores 
the essence but arises quickly, yang can stabilize [yin] as 
it protects the outside.' In general, if the yang is unable to 
maintain the yin, the yin cannot respond urgently or store 
the essence; if the yin cannot maintain the yang, then the 
yang cannot stabilize or protect the exterior. Nocturnal 
emissions and loss of essence is the yang failing to maintain 
the yin. Loss of essence in the urine is the yin failing to 
maintain the yang. Allii tuberosi Semen (}iii cili zi) enters 
the Kidneys [where it provides) sufficient sweetness and 
warmth to respond urgently, and sufficient sourness and 
warmth to stabilize. Having both of these advantages, it is 
thus a marvelous thing for nocturnal emissions and loss of 
essence in the urine. This, however, is yin and yang unable 
to mutually maintain: if the deficiency is extreme and this 
pattern occurs, then [it] will be unable to serve [alone], and 
one should perhaps add other warm, securing herbs. 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica says of these 
seeds: 
Acrid, warm, yang within yin; they should be dry-fried until 
yellow before using. Governs nocturnal emissions, leakage 
of essence, blood in the urine, and warms the lower back 
and knees. Fortifies male sexual function, treats [draining) 
sexual dreams, tonifies the Liver, Kidneys, and the gate 
of vitality. Stops urinary frequency, incontinence, and in 
women [treats] excessive vaginal secretions, vaginal dis-
charge, cold sensations in the vagina, and lower abdominal 
pain.
