## 📖 Overview

*Cinnamomi Cortex* (ròu guì) is sweet, acrid, and very warm. Its sweetness tonifies, its acridity disperses, and its warmth strongly unblocks cold obstruction. It enters the Heart, Spleen, Liver, and Kidney channels, and the relationships among these Organs and channels define its scope of activity.

It warms the Heart yang, disperses chest painful obstruction due to cold, promotes the movement of blood within the vessels; the use of this herb should always be considered when the pulse is slow. When used for Heart disorders, Cinnamon heart (肉桂心 ròu guì xīn) is the preferred form of this herb. *Cinnamomi Cortex* (ròu guì) warms the Spleen when the Spleen yang is deficient, causing loss of appetite and loose stools with undigested food; if it is due to Kidney yang deficiency, it is even more appropriate. This herb enters the blood aspect of the Liver, dispersing blood stasis, unblocking menstruation in cases of amenorrhea, alleviating menstrual pain due to cold, and breaking up mobile and fixed abdominal masses.

This herb enters and tonifies the Kidney yang and fire at the gate of vitality, and thereby treats such symptoms as cold weakness of the lower back, chilled extremities, and nocturia. If the influence of yin is excessive in the lower burner, the weak yang can be forced outward, producing manifestations of false heat. In this case, the acrid warmth of *Cinnamomi Cortex* (ròu guì) can disperse the congealed yin influence, and allow the yang to return to its root in the gate of vitality. One view, however, is that it is not as suitable in cases of yang floating outward due to weakness of the yang itself (see Comparisons below).

The association of the Liver and the Kidneys at the level of the sinews and bones means that this herb will also be effective in the treatment of painful obstruction conditions due to cold and dampness, treating joint pain all over the body. This use was mentioned as early as the *Divine Pivot*, which recommends that *Cinnamomi Cortex* (ròu guì), *Zanthoxyli Pericarpium* (花椒 huā jiāo), and *Zingiberis Rhizoma* (干姜 gān jiāng) be soaked in wine, then bandages be soaked in the same wine and wrapped around areas of pain, with heat applied to the bandages.

In *Convenient Reader of Materia Medica*, Zhang Bing Cheng observed that it is acrid, sweet, and very warming, tonifies the gate of vitality, reinforces fire, and reduces yin. Purple, crimson, and very aromatic, it augments the Liver and Kidneys, unblocks the channels, and promotes the movement of blood. For conditions such as lower backache and bulging disorders, it guides and it warms; for pathogens such as wind-cold and painful obstruction due to dampness, it disseminates and disperses.

Its sweetness carries some acridity, and naturally has a measure of aromatic piercing warmth. It enters the blood level of the four channels Heart, Liver, Spleen, and Kidneys, where its warmth disperses pathogenic cold at the blood level, breaks up blood clumping, and expels mobile and fixed abdominal masses. Together with herbs that tonify the Kidneys, it tonifies insufficiency of the primal yang at the gate of vitality in disorders such as weak yang forced outward or upward by overabundant yin [see, however, Comparisons below]; it can also guide fire back to its origin. If one wishes to tonify the Heart yang or augment the Spleen yang, it can be combined with the appropriate assistant or envoy herbs.

In *Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western*, Zhang Xi-Chun explains the basis for its therapeutic qualities:

Because it is the bark from the lower part of the tree, its nature reaches downward to warm the cinnabar field, fortify the primal yang, and tonify the ministerial fire. Its color is purple-crimson, so it is excellent for tonifying the sovereign fire and warmly unblocking the blood vessels. It treats blood vessels painfully obstructed by cold all around the body, and thus treats pain in the joints, lower back, and limbs.
