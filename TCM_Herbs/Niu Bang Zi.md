## 📖 Overview

Entering the Lungs and Stomach channels, Arctii Fructus (niu bang zi) clears and drains, in addition to its ability to vent and disperse. For this reason, it not only disperses wind-heat, but also clears and drains heat toxin. It is ideal for externally-contracted wind-heat, hot-phlegm coughs, unexpressed rashes, swelling and pain of the throat, and other toxic swellings and sores.

*Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances* elaborates:

Arctii Fructus (niu bang zi) can raise the qi or direct it downward, and powerfully resolve toxic heat. Its flavor is bitter so it clears fire, but also acrid so it dredges wind. Its main area of treatment is wind-phlegm in the upper body, swelling of the face and eyes, difficulty swallowing, and all accumulations of toxic-heat. ... Whenever the Lung channel has constrained fire, or there is wind-heat in the Lung channel, this herb should be used.

The special characteristics of this herb are that it vents, brings out, clears and drains, not only dispersing wind heat, but also clearing and draining constrained fire and heat toxin. Note that Arctii Fructus (niu bang zi) is slippery, enabling it to promote the movement of both stool and urine; it is thus especially indicated where there is constipation and scanty or difficult urination.

*Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica* discusses an overlooked aspect of this herb:

Nowadays people only talk about its toxicity-resolving effects and use it whenever they encounter symptoms such as sores, swelling, pox, or rashes. However, this still misses the point about the herb, which is its ability to release both the exterior and the interior. Whenever people have clumped toxic qi, its most common cause is externally-contracted wind-cold. This impairs the flow of nutritive qi and it becomes blocked within the flesh, which engenders toxic abscesses.

Arctii Fructus (niu bang zi) is acrid as well as bitter, so it can direct qi to move downward and likewise disperse wind and expel heat. ... But [because] its nature is cold and slippery; excessive use or high dosage will damage the middle qi, which in turn will make the exterior more deficient. It is particularly forbidden in cases of Spleen deficiency with diarrhea.
