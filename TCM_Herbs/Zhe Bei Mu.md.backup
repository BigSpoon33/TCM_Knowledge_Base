## 📖 Overview

Fritillariae thunbergii Bulbus (zhe bei mu) cools heat and transforms phlegm, alleviates cough and disperses clumps and so is appropriate for externally-contracted pathogenic wind with phlegm-heat constraining the Lungs, leading to cough with thick yellow phlegm; chest pain resulting from phlegm clumping in the chest; scrofula; boils and other toxic swellings. Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica notes that it, "while bitter and cold, also has an implicit acrid, dispersing action; thus, while it can expel heat, drain and direct downward, it can also disperse clumps." Omissions from the Grand Materia Medica notes that Zhang Jing-Yue emphasized the herb's efficacy in treating toxic swellings, and extended this to other wounds as well: bleeding from wounds from metal implements, pain from fire sores, it can be applied as a powder or decocted and taken internally. Its flavor and nature are both strong, and compared to Fritillariae cirrhosae Bulbus (chuan bei mu), its ability to cool and direct downward is several times greater.

*   Clears heat and dissipates nodules: for phlegm-fire which congeals and causes neck swellings. Also important for Lung and breast abscess and swellings.
    *   With Scrophulariae Radix (xuan shen), Ostreae Concha (mu li), and Prunellae Spica (xia ku cao) for scrofula.
    *   Especially due to phlegm-fire with pain and swelling at multiple sites, as in Reduce Scrofula Pill (xiao luo wan).
