## 📖 Overview

Amomi Fructus (sha ren) is strongly aromatic, warming, drying, and comfortably spreading, thus it warms the Spleen and Stomach, disseminates the qi, transforms turbid dampness, improves the appetite, stops nausea, alleviates diarrhea, and mobilizes stagnant qi to be expelled from the bowels. When the qi dynamic flows smoothly, and the middle burner is harmonious, the placenta is naturally calm. This is the rationale behind the use of this herb to calm the fetus.

Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances observes: "Its aromatic qi harmonizes the five organs, and follows guiding herbs to unblock and mobilize all channels." The Grand Materia Medica says that it "promotes qi movement and stops pain; when fetal qi is injured and disturbed, the pain is unbearable." Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica elaborates: "As to the statement that it stops pain and calms the fetus ... this too is the significance of harmonizing the middle and smoothing the flow of qi."

This herb can be used alone as a powder to regulate the qi, calm the fetus, awaken the Spleen, and unbind the Stomach. It is used both for restless fetus disorder as well as diarrhea from Spleen cold.

    *   With Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (白术 - bai zhu) and Codonopsis Radix (党参 - dang shen) for abdominal pain and diarrhea due to dampness obstructing the Spleen and Stomach. This combination is also used for morning sickness.

    *   With Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (白术 - bai zhu) and Perillae Caulis (紫苏梗 - zi su geng) for restless fetus.
    *   With Scutellariae Radix (黄芩 - huang qin) for restless fetus due to heat.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Do not use in cases of heat from yin deficiency. See Toxicity below.

Acrid, rapidly mobilizing, and drying by nature; it should not be used in those with blood deficiency or blazing fire. If overly consumed by pregnant women, it exhausts the qi, necessarily leading to difficult labor. Care should be taken to clearly differentiate [symptoms resembling its indications, but actually inappropriate, such as] abdominal pain due to fire, diarrhea due to hot summerheat, vaginal discharge due to damp-heat, cough and rebellious qi due to gushing fire compelling the Lungs, rather than cough due to obstruction of cold qi. Mistaken application is harmful (Harm and Benefit rather than beneficial: be careful in Materia Medica).
