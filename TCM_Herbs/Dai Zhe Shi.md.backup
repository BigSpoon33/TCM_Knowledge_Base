## 📖 Overview

Bitter, cold, and heavy in weight, Haematitum (dai zhe shi) cools heat and suppresses rebellion, relying on its heaviness to sedate the Liver fire, and to calm and direct the rebellious qi downward. Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica observes: "The heaviness of Haematitum (dai zhe shi) is used to sedate rebellious qi."

It is thus used for dizziness, tinnitus, and deafness due to Liver yang ascendancy. When there is transverse rebellion of Liver fire affecting the Lungs and Stomach, leading to nausea, vomiting, belching, and acute wheezing from phlegm, Haematitum (dai zhe shi) can be used as a chief medicinal. Its heaviness sedates trepidation, jitteriness, and fright causing the qi to float upward, and it is used in the treatment of convulsions in both adults and children.

Because the Liver stores the blood, and Haematitum (dai zhe shi) excels at clearing Liver fire, it also cools the blood and stops bleeding associated with heat in the blood, whether it manifests as nosebleed, vomiting of blood, or continuous uterine bleeding.

As explained in Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western: It can generate blood while cooling blood; its weighty mass excels at suppressing rebellious qi, directing phlegm downward, stopping nausea and vomiting, and unblocking dry clumps-when used adroitly it can achieve marvelous results.
