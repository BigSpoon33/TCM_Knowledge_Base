## 📖 Overview

The Changsha Explanation of Medicines provides perhaps the best summary of the actions of Maltosum (*yi tang*): "Tonifies the Spleen and Stomach, transforms the Stomach qi, generates fluids, nourishes the blood, moderates interior urgency, alleviates abdominal pain." However, it is the Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians that sets forth the classical definition of its indications: "Primarily tonifies consumptive deficiency, alleviates thirst, and expels blood."

In Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica, Miao Xi-Yong elaborates:

"[It] is sweet to enter the Spleen, and because rice and wheat are both Spleen and Stomach nourishing substances, it primarily tonifies consumptive deficiency, precisely the reason it is used [Zhang] Zhong-Jing's Minor Construct the Middle Decoction (*xiao jian zhong tang*). Fire in the Lungs and Stomach causes thirst, and when fire blazes upward it forces the blood into chaotic movement, causing spitting up of blood. Sweetness can moderate the manifestation of fire, so that by directing fire downward, thirst is alleviated and bleeding is eliminated."

Records of Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica observes:

"Sowing upon the earth produces sweetness, and Maltosum (*yi tang*) is the quintessence of the quintessence of the crop. Spleen earth resides in the middle. If there is consumptive deficiency, one should construct the middle, but in constructing the middle there should be no veering laterally: only Maltosum (*yi tang*) [of all the medicinals] has this focus. Thus, when the sage [Zhang] Zhong-Jing named Minor Construct the Middle Decoction (*xiao jian zhong tang*), the formula had to include Maltosum (*yi tang*), for without it, it would not have been given that name."
