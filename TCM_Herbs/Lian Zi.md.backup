## 📖 Overview

Sweet and neutral, such that it tonifies, and astringent, such that it binds, Nelumbinis Semen (*lian zi*) enters the Heart, Spleen, and Kidney channels where it nourishes the Heart and reestablishes harmonious communication between the Heart and Kidneys. In this way it treats palpitations and insomnia and at the same time tonifies the Spleen to stop chronic diarrhea, vaginal discharge, and bleeding due to the inability of the Spleen to contain blood. Known as the 'fruit of the Spleen' (*pi guo*), the lotus seed has been highly regarded for its supplemental and therapeutic qualities since the time of the earliest materia medica texts. The Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica says of the herb: "Flavor sweet and neutral. Primarily tonifies the middle, nourishes the spirit, augments the power of the qi, and eliminates the hundred disorders. Long-term consumption lightens the body, slows aging, assuages hunger, and extends life." The Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi adds that it "augments the qi, stops thirst, assists the Heart, and stops dysenteric disorders. Treats lower back pain and draining of the essence."

The Grand Materia Medica offers a more complete description of its therapeutic range:

Reestablishes harmonious communication between the Heart and Kidneys, favors the Stomach and Intestines, secures the essential qi, makes the tendons and bones strong, tonifies deficiency and injury, facilitates hearing and vision, expels cold-dampness, stops Spleen diarrhea and chronic dysenteric disorders, red-and-white turbid urine, and all vaginal discharge and bleeding disorders in women.

In Essentials of the Materia Medica, Wang Ang adds: "Cools the Heart, eliminates irritability, opens the Stomach to improve the appetite, and specifically treats dysenteric disorders with an inability to eat and such conditions as turbid painful urinary dribbling."

Chen Shi-Duo has a typically unorthodox observation:

The average person says that one should not consume the heart [i.e., plumule] of the lotus seed for fear of sudden turmoil disorder [see NOMENCLATURE & PREPARATION below]. They do not know that using lotus seeds without the heart will have no effect, as its excellence is completely in the heart .... The heart of the lotus seed cools Heart fire, but also cools Kidney fire. When the two fires blaze, then the Heart and Kidneys do not communicate; when the two fires are cooled, then the Heart and Kidneys naturally combine. Eliminating the heart and using only the flesh of the lotus seed is only good for nourishing the Spleen and Stomach, and does not augment the Heart nor the Kidneys .... Thus the heart definitely cannot be removed from the seed, for once the heart is removed, the spirit will not be nourished, the resolve will not be settled, the draining of essence will not be halted, and lower back pain will not be relieved.
