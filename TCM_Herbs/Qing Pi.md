## 📖 Overview

Acrid, bitter, and warm, Citri reticulatae viride Pericarpium (qing pi) is fierce in nature and primarily enters the Gallbladder, Liver, and Stomach channels. It directs downward, dredges the Liver and Gallbladder, breaks up qi stagnation, disperses clumping, reduces areas of hardness, and stops pain. It is often used in the treatment of Liver qi constraint and stagnation, pain in the hypochondriac regions, breast distention, and abdominal pain. Because it also enters the Stomach channel it reduces the food stagnation leading to phlegm accumulation associated with epigastric and abdominal distention and pain.

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica describes the herb as follows:

Bitter in flavor, slightly sour; the fullness of its flavor [indicates that it] sinks. Yang within yin. Its bitterness expels obstruction, sourness enters the Liver as well as the lesser yang: Triple Burner and Gallbladder organs. It reduces firm lumps, dispels pain in the hypochondrium, relieves constraint and anger, treats bulging disorders, dredges the Liver, breaks up stagnant qi, and expands the chest.

In Essentials of the Materia Medica, after quoting the statement that Citri reticulatae viride Pericarpium (qing pi) dredges the Liver and drains the Lungs, Wang Ao makes an interesting observation: "Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) dredges upper burner Liver qi, and Citri reticulatae viride Pericarpium (qing pi) calms lower burner Liver qi; any herb that drains qi is said to drain the Lungs."

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Straight Direction from [Yang] Ren-Zhai warns that this herb "cannot be used for those with sweating." The Grand Materia Medica elaborates: "[For] reducing accumulation in children, usually Citri reticulatae viride Pericarpium (qing pi) is used, which very readily induces sweating; [therefore] it cannot be used for those who are [already] sweating." Essentials of the Materia Medica explains it from another standpoint: "Peels can reach the skin, acrid flavors excel at discharging and dispersing."

Hidden Aspects of Materia Medica concludes that, for the "aged, weak, deficient, or emaciated, the best is total abstinence [from this herb]."
