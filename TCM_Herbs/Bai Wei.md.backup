## 📖 Overview

Cynanchi Atrati Radix (Bai Wei) enters the Lung, Stomach, and Kidney channels. It is bitter, but not drying, so it directs it downward; it is salty, and can thus enter the blood, and also cold, enabling it to clear heat. These actions are performed without injuring the yin or blood. And because blood-level heat is cleared, the yin and blood are protected by this herb, which is equivalent to replenishing these substances. It cools both the heat of yin deficiency as well as that due to pathogenic excess, venting the pathogenic influence toward the surface where it is released. This is useful in such cases as prolonged low-grade fever due to a residual pathogenic influence in the later stages of a febrile disorder: heat in the blood is cooled directly and also by venting.

This herb cools the Lungs and facilitates the passage of urine, enabling it to treat painful urinary dribbling in which the urine is scanty and burning. Its functions in treating urinary disorders and sores are of secondary importance, however. Heat from deficiency following childbirth, painful urinary dribbling with blood in the urine, early periods due to heat in the blood-all of these conditions are appropriately treated with this herb. It also can be used for cough due to Lung heat, especially if associated with a low-grade fever.

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica elaborates on the nature of this herb:

The Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica states that the nature of Cynanchi Atrati Radix (Bai Wei) is neutral, but because it primarily treats warm and febrile pathogens, this 'neutral' should be 'cold'. Records of Famous Physicians does in fact call it 'greatly cold' - this should be its basic nature .... All bitter-cold herbs tend to be drying, except Cynanchi Atrati Radix (Bai Wei). Although cold, it does not harm the yin fluids, essence, or blood. Thus, its main indications all relate to heat at the blood level rather than to any damp-heat disorder. It can be regarded as possessing a mild, inherent yin enriching quality within its main heat-clearing actions. This is why ancient formulas used it so often for women.
