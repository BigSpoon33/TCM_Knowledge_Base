NoTE 
There are many plants called i&.iU&. ban ian gen 
in China with complex issues of identification and use. 
At this point, the standard plant is Isatis indigotica, which 
follows as the main entry. The other most common herb 
comes from Baphicacanthus cusia and is known as south-
ern ban ian gen ( ~ i& iii=&. nan ban ian gen); see the 
ADDENDUM to the following entry. When the precise 
identification of the herb is unclear, we use the term 
Isatidis/Baphicacanthis Radix (ban ian gen).

Commentary 
Bitter and cold, Isatidis Radix (bei ban ldn gen) enters the 
Heart, Lung, and Stomach channels, and is quite similar 
in effect to Isatidis Folium (da q!ng ye), for which it can 
be substituted. It clears heat, cools the blood, and resolves 
toxicity, and is often used for symptoms due to externally-
contracted wind-heat, epidemic toxins, and seasonal toxic 
pathogens such as swollen, sore, and ulcerated throat, high 
fever, redness with burning pain of the face and headache, 
and mumps. 
In Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing-
Cheng says ofisatidis Radix ([bei] ban ldn gen): 
Like Isatidis Folium (da qingye), it enters the blood level 
of the Liver and Stomach; its four actions are clearing heat, 
resolving toxins, avoiding contagion, and killing parasites. 
The only difference is that the leaves primarily disperse 
while the root primarily directs downward. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
:::» WITH SOP HORAE TONKINENSIS RADIX (shan dou gen); 
see page 208 
Comparisons 
:::» Vs. lSATIDIS FOLIUM (da q!ngye) and INDIGO 
NATURALIS (q!ngdai) 
All three herbs originate from the same plants and are 
effective in cooling heat in the blood and reducing skin 
blotches. The first two herbs both cool heat toxin in the 
Heart and Stomach, but Isatidis Folium (da q!ng ye) is 
generally used for rashes associated with warm toxin, and 
swollen sore throat, while Isatidis Radix (bei ban ian gen) is 
used for massive head febrile disorder and throat obstruc-
tion due to mumps. Indigo naturalis (q!ng dai) also cools 
the Liver and drains fire and is thus best for toxic sores due 
to fire and heat, rashes from warm toxin, coughing or spit-
ting up blood, and childhood convulsions. 
Toxicity 
There is one case report of this substance being implicated 
in bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
The situation regarding identification of this herb is quite 
complex, as can be seen in the ALTERNATE SPECIES & LOCAL 
VARIANTS and ADULTERANTS sections below. While there 
are many plants called :f&.jU~ ban ldn gen in China, the 
one described here is the standard plant according to the 
Chinese Pharmacopoiea and is known as northern ban ldn 
gen (:Jl:f&.it:f~ bei ban fan gen). The other most common 
herb comes from Baphicacanthus cusia and is known as 
southern ban ldn gen ( m 
:f&. it:f~ nan ban fan gen); see the 
ADDENDUM which follows this entry and photo on page 
1145. When the precise identification is unclear, we use the 
term Isatidis/Baphicacanthis Radix (ban fan gen).
