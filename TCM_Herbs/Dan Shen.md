## üìñ Overview

Bitter and slightly cooling, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix (dan shen) enters the blood level of the Heart, Pericardium, and Liver channels to invigorate the blood, transform stasis, and tonify the blood. It cools the blood, reduces swelling, clears heat from the nutritive level, and eliminates irritability. Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix (dan shen) is a primary herb for gynecological disorders involving blood stasis and blood heat, and is also used in the treatment of joint pain and sores.

Materia Medica of Combinations states that it "nourishes the blood, invigorates the blood, generates new blood, and expels retained blood ... it cures fever and chills due to consumption, and stops pain in the joints." The Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica adds that it "also treats red eyes, bulging disorder pain, sores, scabies, and toxic swellings, expels pus, and generates flesh."

Regarding the ability of this herb to calm irritability due to heat, Materia Medica of South Yunnan says that it "tonifies the Heart and settles the emotions, quiets the spirit and makes tranquil the Heart." It is used for restlessness, irritability, palpitations, and insomnia due to heat entering the nutritive level.

Many later materia medica texts contain the statement that "the single herb Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix (dan shen), powdered, has effects equal to those of Four-Substance Decoction (si wu tang) and therefore treats all women's disorders." However, this statement was roundly criticized by such writers as Zhang Shan-Lei. In Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, Zhang says that even this famous formula cannot, by itself, treat all women's disorders, and "even more, a single-herb formula-is this not a huge joke? ... Mediocre physicians and vulgar practitioners all thrill to its simplicity, memorize it, and use it indiscriminately!" Zhang goes on to place the blame squarely at the feet of Li Shi-Zhen, who (he says) uncritically quoted the passage from an earlier work in his Grand Materia Medica.

In Zhang Bing Cheng's Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Cheng says that it may have the character shen [which is in the name of Ginseng Radix (ren shen)] as part of its name, but its blood tonifying action is rather weak, while its blood-invigorating action is very strong; it is a capital herb for regulating the blood level. The reason [earlier materia medica said that] it treats wind painful obstruction and expels clumped accumulations is that when the blood moves, wind is naturally extinguished, and accumulations are naturally mobilized.

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated during pregnancy. Do not use in combination with Veratri Nigri Radix et Rhizoma (Li Lu). See Toxicity below.

Traditional Contraindications:
Although it can tonify the blood, it is best at promoting blood movement. If menstruation is early in its course, or obstructed due to lack of blood, or if the blood is limited and unable to nourish a fetus causing the fetus to become restless, or after giving birth the blood flows smoothly-in none of these cases should [Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix (dan shen)] be used; if it is used it will cause continuous bleeding. Whenever during a warm or febrile disorder the pathogen is in the qi level, if Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix (dan shen) is mistakenly used, it will lead [the pathogen] into the blood or the nutritive level: one must be cautious. Long-term consumption often leads to reddened eyes; thus Materia Medica it should be [called] warm in nature; the states that it is slightly cold, one fears this is a mistake. Unless there is good cause, its use is contraindicated for pregnant women and yin-deficient patients. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)
