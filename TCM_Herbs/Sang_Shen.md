Commentary 
Sweet and cold, Mori Fructus (sting shen) enters the Heart, 
Liver, and Kidney channels with a nature that is harmo-
nious and gentle, tonifying the blood and yin without 
being cloying or upsetting the digestion. It is often used 
for yin and blood deficiency patterns involving dryness of 
the mouth and thirst, as well as headache, dizziness, and 
insomnia associated with Liver yin deficiency, which allows 
the Liver yang to ascend. This medicinal is moistening and 
lubricates the Intestines. 
Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of 
Materia Medica states that the mulberry 
concentrates the best essential parts of the tree. Its flavor 
is sweet, its nature is cold, its color begins as crimson 
but ends up as purple, and [it is] rich in flavor. It can be 
summed up as sweet, cold, augmenting the blood while 
expelling heat-without a doubt it is a substance that cools 
the blood, tonifies the blood, and augments the yin.
