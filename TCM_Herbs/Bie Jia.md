## üìñ Overview

Trionycis Carapax (bie jia) is salty, slightly cold, and heavy in weight. Because it is derived from an animal, it is considered to be 'a substance of sympathy between blood and flesh' (Ë°ÄËÇâÊúâÊÉÖ‰πãÂìÅ xue rou you qing zhi pin), thus strongly tonifies the yin fluids. Being heavy in weight, it subdues the yang. And because it is slightly cooling, it clears heat. For these reasons it excels at enriching the yin to anchor the yang and eliminate heat from deficiency, and is thus used to treat yin deficiency leading to steaming bones or ascendant Liver yang, either due to injury to the yin and blood following a warm-heat pathogen disease, or chronic illness injuring the yin and blood. It is also used for internal stirring of wind from deficiency, resulting from the inability of the Liver and Kidneys to nourish the sinews, leading in mild cases to tremor of the hands and feet, and in more severe cases, to convulsions. Traditionally, for the purpose of enriching the yin and subduing the yang, it should be used in its unprepared form.

When vinegar-fried, it enters the blood level of the Liver channel with an enhanced ability to promote movement, and its salty quality endows it with the ability to soften areas of hardness and clumping, such as mobile and fixed abdominal masses or painless clumping in the flanks. The *New Compilation of Materia Medica* says that it "excels in attacking hard [areas], and does not deplete the qi, so it should be used for any stubborn focal stagnation, internally or externally, in the upper or lower [body]." Thus, traditionally, to soften areas of hardness and disperse clumps, the vinegar-fried variety should be used.

In *Convenient Reader of Materia Medica*, Zhang Bing Cheng says that its "nature is fundamentally salty and cold, enters the Liver channel and thrusts out to the collaterals with the effect of promoting movement in stagnant lumps, reducing heat, and subduing the yang." He goes on to explain that it enters the Liver because its color is green; it is salty, cold, and nontoxic, unblocks the channels and collaterals, disperses stagnant blood, and is a medicinal of the terminal yin blood level. All aquatic shells benefit the yin and subdue the yang, and their salty, cold nature is similar - what is different is the places they enter.

*The Materia Medica of Combinations* states that it "travels through the Penetrating vessel."
