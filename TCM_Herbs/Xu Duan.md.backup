## 📖 Overview

The special quality of Dipsaci Radix (xu duan) is that it tonifies the Liver and Kidneys while also invigorating the blood, unblocking the collaterals, and alleviating pain. Because this invigoration does not disturb the blood nor cause bleeding, it is perfectly suited for soreness of the lower back, legs, and knees when Kidney and Liver deficiency fail to provide sufficient nourishment to these areas, as it both increases the supply of nourishment and its delivery to these sites. For the same reason, it is a noted fetal-calming herb when the Kidneys and Liver are deficient and fail to nourish the Penetrating and Conception vessels. It is also commonly used for dysmenorrhea centered in the lower back. *Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica* elaborates:

It is warm and harmonious, heavy in flavor and prolonged in effect, such that it enters both the qi and the blood levels, disseminating and unblocking the hundred vessels, unblocking and facilitating the joints, governing all disorders of the channels and collaterals, sinews and bones, and vessels, but its particular strength lies in unblocking painful obstruction and atrophy disorders. Its flavor is also bitter and astringent, so that it both promotes movement and stops [bleeding], thereby remedying continuous uterine bleeding, vaginal discharge, bleeding dysenteric disorder, turbid painful urinary dribbling, and all gynecological conditions and disorders of the eight extraordinary vessels ... and it does all of this with a nature that is soft and harmonious, without drying, violence, hardness, or suddenness! *Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica* elaborates:

Dipsaci Radix is an herb to tonify and reconnect (xu duan) the blood vessels. On the whole, without this, the blood vessels cannot be reconnected, injured sinews and bones cannot be nourished, stagnation in the joints cannot be freed, and fetal injury cannot be quieted. Taken frequently over the long term, it augments the power of qi, with an effect of torrifying what has been injured and generating blood. It can tonify without leaving stagnation, promote movement without draining, and for these reasons is a favorite herb in gynecology and external medicine.
