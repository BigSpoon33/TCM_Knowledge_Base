- With Cuscutae Semen (tu sl zi) and Alpiniae oxyphyllae 
Fructus (yl zhl ren) for urinary frequency, both daytime 
and nighttime, from Kidney yang deficiency. 
-
With Juglandis Semen (he tao ren) and Eucommiae 
Cortex (du zhimg) for severe lower back pain or premature 
ejaculation, cough, and wheezing from Kidney yang defi-
ciency, as in Young Maiden Pill (qlng e wan). 
• Tonifies and warms the Spleen yang and stops diarrhea: for 
diarrhea due to cold from deficiency of the Spleen, borbo-
rygmus, and abdominal pain. Most appropriate in those 
with both Spleen and Kidney deficiency. 
- With Myristicae Semen (riJU dou kou), Schisandrae 
Fructus (wil wei zi), and Evodiae Fructus (wu zhu yu) for 
daybreak diarrhea, characterized by abdominal pain and 
borborygmus in the early morning hours that is alleviated 
upon evacuation, and is accompanied by a deep, thin pulse 
and a white tongue coating, as in Four-Miracle Pill (sl shen 
wan). 
• Also used topically as a tincture for vitiligo. 
Commentary 
Acrid, bitter, and very warming, Psoraleae Fructus (bil gil 
zhl) tonifies the yang of both the Spleen and Kidneys, and 
has an astringent nature that acts on the Kidneys to secure 
the primal yang, and on the Spleen to stop diarrhea. It 
is often used to treat impotence, spermatorrhea, urinary 
frequency, and pain due to cold in the lower back and legs, 
as well as diarrhea associated with Spleen and Kidney yang 
deficiency. It also assists the Kidneys in grasping the qi, and 
can be used in the treatment of cough and wheezing due to 
cold from deficiency. Soaked in wine and applied topically, 
it is used to treat vitiligo. 
Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of 
Materia Medica explains that Psoraleae Fructus (bil gil 
zhl): 
is an important herb to warm the water organ, generate 
yang from within yin, reinforce fire and augment earth ... 
because it warms the water organ, it tonifies fire to generate 
earth, which means that the true fire within the Kidneys is 
tonified so that it can ascend to ripen and cook water and 
grains, steam the dregs, and transform the subtle essence. 
Spleen qi disperses essence to rise upward into the Lungs, 
and thus all of the five organs are nourished. 
When applied topically for vitiligo, the affected area should 
be exposed to daylight (approximately 10 minutes) or 
ultraviolet light (2-5 minutes). It should then be washed to 
prevent local skin reactions. These can include a macular 
rash or blisters. If these do occur, administration of the 
herb should cease. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
)> WITH }UGLANDIS SEMEN (he tao ren) 
Psoraleae Fructus (bil gil zhl) is acrid, bitter, and very 
warm, with a hard, yang nature. Juglandis Semen (he tao 
ren) is sweet and warm, with a soft, yin nature; its flesh 
moistens while its black inner skin is astringent, and this 
astringency helps the Kidneys grasp qi. Together, hard and 
soft mutually assist each other, hence the combination is 
often used to fortify the Kidney yang and help it grasp the 
qi in the treatment of coughs and wheezing, to strengthen 
the sinews and bones, and to treat lower burner cold from 
deficiency causing aching of the lower back and knees, 
impotence, and premature ejaculation. 
The Grand Materia Medica explains the rationale un-
derlying this combination: 
Psoraleae Fructus (bu gu zhf) is usually taken together 
with Juglandis Semen (he tdo ren) . ... Psoraleae Fructus 
(bu gu zhl) pertains to fire ... and makes the fire of the 
Pericardium meet and connect with the fire at the gate of 
vitality. Thus the primal yang is fortified and stabilized, 
and the marrow is solidly filled .. . Juglandis Semen (he tdo 
ren) pertains to wood, moistens dryness, and nourishes the 
blood. Blood is yin, and is averse to dryness, thus oil can 
moisten it. Assisted by Psoraleae Fructus (bu gu zhf), we 
have the marvelous mutual generation of fire and wood! 
Zhang Shan-Lei adds that, "Of the two, one moistens and 
one dries, and it is a fine formula to secure and bind the 
primal yang while enriching and increasing the sinews and 
bones."

Comparisons 
::» Vs. AsTRAGALI COMPLANATI SEMEN (sha yuan zi) 
Both herbs tonify the Kidney yang, secure the essence, and 
treat urinary frequency. However, Psoraleae Fructus (bil gil 
zhf) is very warm, and also tonifies the Spleen yang and has 
an astringent nature that treats diarrhea. Astragali compla-
nati Semen (sha yuan zi), by contrast, is not overly warm 
or drying, and brightens the eyes, so that it can tonify Liver 
and Kidney deficiency that leads to blurry vision. 
::» Vs. ALPINIAE OXYPHYLLAE FRUCTUS (yl zhl ren); 
see page 790 
Traditional Contraindications 
Its nature is drying and it assists fire; it is not to be taken 
when there is yin deficiency with fire blazing, excessive 
erections, spermatorrhea, blood in the urine, scanty, dif-
ficult urination, reddened eyes, bitter taste, dry tongue, 
and dry constipation, when internal heat causes thirst, or

fire ascends causing indefinable epigastric discomfort, or 
damp-heat resulting in atrophy and weakness of the bones. 
(Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
This book, and a number of other materia medica texts, 
also state that Psoraleae Fructus (bu gu zhl) is contrain-
dicated during pregnancy. However, in Readings in the 
Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica, Chen 
Nian-Zu observes that "The reference to 'abortion' in the 
Materia Medica of the Kaibao Era meant that this could be 
used to treat someone about to miscarry a pregnancy, not 
that it can cause miscarriage!" Chen goes on to explain that, 
in fact, it "greatly stabilizes the fetus." Modern Chinese 
gynecology concurs with Chen and regards this as an herb 
that is used to prevent miscarriage due to instability of the 
Kidney yang. 
According to some traditional sources, they should not be 
taken with strong tea. 
Toxicity 
Within the normal dosage range no side effects are to be 
expected. Overdosage may cause toxic symptoms such as 
general weakness, dizziness, and blurred vision followed 
by tachypnea, vomiting, and, in severe cases, hematemesis, 
loss of consciousness, coma, and dyspnea. When taken 
orally, allergic reactions have been reported affecting both 
the skin and the upper digestive tract and mouth. Skin 
rashes and intense pruritis have also been reported follow-
ing topical administration. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "tonify bone resin" 
There are a number of similar sounding names applied to 
this herb, such as broken old paper (bit ti ~1\ po gil zhl) and 
grandma's stubborn fat (Jt lil Jll';j p6 gil zhz). Because the 
best quality is large, full, and black, it is also known as black 
old paper OUHI\ hei gil zhl). All of these names have a 
similar sound in Chinese, but with widely different mean-
ings. This often indicates transliteration of a foreign term 
and is probably the case here. In ancient Indian medicine, 
this herb is called either bakuchi or bavachee, hence the 
various Chinese names are probably attempts to repro-
duce this sound, rather than attempts to convey meaning. 
Bakuchi has been used for well over two thousand years in 
Indian medicine (for treating vitiligo, among other things), 
but for just over a thousand years in Chinese medicine, so 
the direction of influence is obvious. The Grand Materia 
Medica notes: "This substance originally came overseas by 
boat from outer barbarian [lands]; it is not from China. The 
barbarians call it bu gu zhz, which has been changed to po gil 
zhi." Its origin in India, however, is not specified. 
::o> DRY-FRIED PsoRALEA O;Y~ill1f Jll';i chew bu gu zhl) 
The sliced herb is dry-fried until yellow, aromatic, and 
slightly split. This method of preparation moderates its 
bitter-drying and acrid-dispersing qualities, so that it tends 
more to warm the yang and stop diarrhea. 
::o> SALT-FRIED PSORALEA (lj_:k;Hm1f Jll';j ydn chao bu gu zhz) 
The fruit is mixed with salt water, left covered briefly, then 
dry-fried or baked until dry. This is also known as pre-
pared psoralea ( k. ~ill1f Jll';j zhl bu gu zhl). It has the effect of 
directing the actions of the herb into the Kidney channel, 
enhancing its ability to tonify and secure the lower burner 
primal yang. It is often used in the treatment of urinary 
frequency, incontinence, impotence, and Kidneys failing 
to grasp the qi. 
::o> WINE-FRIED PsoRA LEA ()gjj :k'J~ill1f Jll';i jiu chao bu gu zhl) 
The herb is mixed with yellow rice wine, left covered over-
night to absorb the wine, then dry-fried or baked until dry. 
This method of preparation exploits the acrid-dispersing 
qualities of the wine to enhance the acrid flavor ofPsoraleae 
Fructus (bu gu zhl), strengthening its ability to treat painful 
obstruction due to wind-dampness. Nowadays, however, it 
is rarely used.

Commentary 
Alpiniae oxyphyllae Fructus (yl zhl ren) is acrid, warm, and 
aromatic, but also astringent, so that it warms the Spleen 
and Stomach to harmonize the middle, treat diarrhea, and 
contain excessive saliva; it also warms the Kidney yang 
and secures the lower burner. Thus it is often used in the 
treatment of Spleen and Stomach exposure to cold causing 
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and 
excessive salivation; and for cold from deficiency of the 
Kidneys leading to spermatorrhea, urinary incontinence, 
and continuous uterine bleeding. 
Essentials of the Materia Medica says that it 
binds the essence, stabilizes the qi, warms the middle to 
improve food intake, contains thick saliva and sputum, 
secures the urine, and treats nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
lodged cold accosting the Stomach, cold qi abdominal pain, 
continuous uterine bleeding, vaginal discharge, and drain-
ing of the essence. 
Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica 
adds that it "augments the Spleen and Stomach, regulates 
the primal qi, tonifies Kidney deficiency [which allows] 
slippage of essence, Stomach deficiency with excessive sali-
vation, and continuous uterine bleeding in women."

12 I Tonijying Herbs 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica summa-
rizes: "Everything the commentators have said is nothing 
but the effect of warm binding .. . it warmly tonifies the 
Spleen and Kidneys, but particularly governs securing and 
binding." 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
:> WITH LINDERAE RADIX (wu yiw) 
Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica observes: "Alpiniae 
oxyphyllae Fructus (yl zhl ren) is acrid and warm, with 
actions that specifically dry the Spleen and warm the 
Stomach, at the same time inhibiting rebellious qi of the 
Spleen and Kidneys, grasping and storing so that it returns 
to its base." Linderae Radix (wu yiw) is acrid and warm, 
and although it is typically used as a qi-regulating herb, it 
is also excellent for warming the Kidneys, dispersing cold, 
and expelling cold qi in the Bladder. 
Together the primary strength of Alpiniae oxyphyllae 
Fructus (yl zhl ren) is to warmly contain the Kidney qi so 
that it returns to its base. In this it is assisted by the abil-
ity of Linderae Radix (wu yao) to expel cold and warm 
the Bladder, thereby facilitating its qi transformation. 
The two herbs complement each other to strongly warm 
the Kidneys and secure the urine, and are thus frequently 
used together for cold from deficiency of the lower burner 
leading to incontinence, urinary frequency, or terminal 
dribbling of urine. It should be noted that this presentation 
tends to worsen when the patient is exposed to cold, but 
does not include dark urine, sensations of burning when 
passing urine, or pain on urination. 
Comparisons 
:> Vs. PsoRALEAE FRUCTUS (bu gu zhi) 
Both herbs warm and tonify the Spleen and Kidneys, fortify 
the yang, stop diarrhea, secure the essence and urine, and 
are commonly used in the treatment of Spleen and Kidney 
yang deficiency. However, Alpiniae oxyphyllae Fructus (yl 
zhl ren) more strongly warms the Spleen yang, and sec-
ondarily warms the Kidneys, while Psoraleae Fructus (bu 
gu zhi) primarily warms the Kidney yang and thereby indi-
rectly warms the Spleen yang. Both herbs treat diarrhea, 
but Alpiniae oxyphyllae Fructus (yl zhl ren) primarily treats 
diarrhea associated with the exposure of the Spleen and 
Stomach to cold, while Psoraleae Fructus (bu gu zhi) treats 
chronic diarrhea and cock-crow diarrhea due to Spleen and 
Kidney yang deficiency. In addition, Psoraleae Fructus (bu 
gu zhf) treats lower back pain, while Alpiniae oxyphyllae 
Fructus (yl zhl ren) treats uterine bleeding. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Do not mistakenly use if the blood is dry from fire." 
(Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica) 
"Its nature is more to travel than to tonify. It should be used 
in tonifying prescriptions; if used by itself it disperses the 
qi." (Arranged Mirror of Medicine) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "benefit intelligence nut" 
Generally, for clinical use, this product is dry-fried to 
remove the shells, leaving the kernels. These should be pul-
verized before dispensing. 
:> SALT-PREPARED ALPINIA (~ ~ 
9iJ 1::. ydn yl zhl ren) 
The kernels are mixed with salt water, left covered briefly 
until the salt water is mostly absorbed, then dry-fried until 
they are dry and darker in color. This is also known as salt 
water alpinia (~ 7}(~ 9iJ 1::. ydn shui yl zhl ren) or salt-fried 
alpinia (~ 
~}· ~ 
9iJ 1::. ydn chao yl zhl ren). 
This method of preparation reduces the acrid, drying 
properties of the cardamon and directs its actions into the 
lower burner, where it specifically secures the essence and 
urine. It is thus often used in the treatment of Kidney yang 
deficiency leading to spermatorrhea, nocturnal emissions, 
incontinence, terminal dribbling, and nocturia.

CAUTIONS & CONTRAINDICATIONS 
Contraindicated in patterns 
of yin deficiency with heat signs. Long-term use is not rec-
ommended. See ToXICITY below. 
Actions & Indications 
• Tonifies the Kidneys and fortifies the yang: for impotence, 
urinary incontinence, nocturnal emissions, and irregular 
menstruation from Kidney yang deficiency. This herb is 
used for infertility from either a cold Womb (in women) or 
cold essence (in men). 
-
With Eucommiae Cortex (du zhimg) for impotence, 
spermatorrhea, and weakness and pain in the lower back 
and legs. 
-
Often combined with Epimedii Herba (yin yang huo) to 
strengthen its effects. This pair of herbs is also the core of 
the formula Two-Immortal Decoction (er xian tang). 
• Expels cold and eliminates dampness: for obstinate cold-
damp painful obstruction with generalized pain, a sense 
of weakness in the bones and sinews, and lower back and 
knee pain. Especially useful for cold abdominal or lower 
back pain. 
-
With Asari Radix et Rhizoma (xl xfn) and Eleutherococci 
gracilistyli Cortex (wu jia pi) for cold-damp induced pain 
and coldness in the lower back and legs. 
Commentary 
Curculiginis Rhizoma (xian mao) has a harsh nature that 
strongly tonifies the Kidney yang, stimulates the fire at 
the gate of vitality, and expels cold-dampness to warm the 
lower back and knees. It is slightly toxic, and should only 
be used for short periods until the desired effect is achieved. 
Because it warms the Kidney yang, it indirectly warms the 
Spleen yang and assists digestion. The Materia Medica of 
the Kaibao Era says that it 
governs cold qi in the epigastrium and abdomen with 
inability to eat, wind-cold causing cramps and spasms in 
the lower back and knees making one unable to walk, damp 
consumption in men, incontinence in the elderly, and 
assists sexual function in males. 
Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica 
adds that it 
is hot in nature, and is an herb to tonify the Triple Burner 
and gate of vitality. It is only appropriate for those with 
impotence, cold essence, atrophy and weakness of the lower 
base, incontinence in the elderly, infertility, and males with 
deficient natural endowment. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
~ WrTH EPIMEDII HERBA (yin yang huo) 
Both herbs strongly reinforce the Kidney yang and fire 
at the gate of vitality, although Epimedii Herba (yin yang 
huo) is more moderate in nature, and also expels wind-
damp painful obstruction. Curculiginis Rhizoma (xian 
mao) is violent, and strongly stimulates the fire at the gate 
of vitality, while also warming the Spleen and Stomach to 
assist in transportation and transformation. These qualities 
beneficially unite in this combination, which is often used 
in the treatment of chills, cold extremities, impotence with 
cold sperm and infertility. Epimedii Herba (yin yang huo) is 
also known as the immortal spirit Spleen (1LL :f~ xian ling 
pi), and the two herbs together are the foundation for the 
decoction Two-Immortal Decoction (er xian tang).
