Commentary 
Bitter, slightly cold, and with a clearing, fragrant aroma, 
Artemisiae scopariae Herba (yfn chen) facilitates the 
removal of dampness, clears heat, and reduces jaundice. It 
is an essential herb for these purposes. 
Jaundice results from the accumulation of dampness 
and heat in the Spleen and Stomach, which is unable to 
vent outward or downward. Rather, it is constrained; it 
steams and fumes the Gallbladder until the bile is forced 
outward to the skin and downward to the Bladder, so that 
both the skin and the urine turn yellow. When the skin 
is a bright yellow-orange, the dampness and heat are of 


4 I Herbs that Drain Dampness

equal strength; this is yang jaundice. If the yellow is darker, 
this represents overabundant cold-dampness coupled with 
yang deficiency; this is yin jaundice. 
Artemisiae scopariae Herba (yin chen) can be used 
for both types of jaundice. For yang jaundice, it should be 
combined with bitter, cold herbs, and for yin jaundice, with 
acrid, hot or sweet, warm herbs that tonify the Spleen. If the 
jaundice is accompanied by edema and urinary difficulty, 
Artemisiae scopariae Herba (yin chen) should be combined 
with bland herbs that leach dampness out of the body. 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica notes 
that this herb provides 
a specific treatment for damp-heat in the Spleen and 
Stomach. In damp jaundice or jaundice due to alcohol, the 
body is yellow and the urine is dark like a sauce. These are 
the signs of accumulated dampness and gathered heat in 
the Stomach earth. This has been the primary herb since 
ancient times; its effect is very rapid. It washes out the 
Intestines and Stomach, thrusts out to the skin-it cannot 
be done without. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
);;-- WITH GARDENIAE FRUCTUS (zhl zi) 
Artemisiae scopariae Herba (y!n chen) clears damp-heat 
from the Spleen and Stomach to treat jaundice. Links to the 
Origins of the Records of Materia Medica observes: 
The special ability of Artemisiae scopariae Herba (yin 
chen) to bring out the old and create the new is unlike 
other herbs that drive out damp-heat; as to those herbs 
that act by leaching and facilitating, they cannot compare 
[with Artemisiae scopariae Herba (yin chen)]. In jaundice, 
if damp qi predominates, the jaundice is smoky and dark; 
if heat predominates, the jaundice is orange and bright. 
Dampness holds in and steams the heat, heat likewise thick-
ens the dampness, and both are based in the middle earth 
damp toxin; Artemisiae scopariae Herba (yin chen) is thus 
suitable for both. 
Gardeniae Fructus (zhi zi) is bitter and cold with a down-
ward-directing nature. Thus, it cools heat, drains fire, 
and facilitates the water pathways of the Triple Burner. 
Discussion of Medicinal Properties says that it "relieves the 
five types of jaundice." 
When used together, Artemisiae scopariae Herba (yin 
chen) is the principal herb and Gardeniae Fructus (zh! zi) 
assists by guiding damp-heat out through the urine. This 
provides a much stronger jaundice-relieving action than 
Artemisiae scopariae Herba (yin chen) alone, and explains 
why the pair is fundamental to many formulas that treat 
jaundice. 
);;-- WITH ACONITI RADIX LATERALIS PREP ARATA (zhl fu zi) 
Artemisiae scopariae Herba (y!n chen) is bitter. It drains 
and directs downward, cooling and clearing dampness to 
eliminate jaundice. Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhl fu 
zi) is very acrid and warming. It is essential for yin and cold 
disorders, warming the Kidneys and Spleen, driving out 
cold, and drying dampness. 
With the added warmth of Aconiti Radix lateralis pre-
parata (zhl fu zi), Artemisiae scopariae Herba (yfn chen) is 
able to treat cold-dampness, while retaining its ability to 
eliminate jaundice. Moreover, the risk that its cold nature 
will injure the Spleen is thereby moderated. This combina-
tion is thus the foundation for many formulas that treat 
yin-type jaundice. It is effective in the treatment of Spleen 
yang deficiency giving rise to dampness, which can become 
constrained and transform into damp-heat. 
);;-- WITH RHEr RADrx ET RHrzoMA (dii huang) 
The combination of these two herbs facilitates the elimina-
tion of both stool and urine, which is helpful in the treat-
ment of damp-heat jaundice. Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (dii 
huang) is bitter and cold. It unblocks the Intestines to guide 
out internal heat, while likewise eliminating damp-heat. 
Adding Artemisiae scopariae Herba (y!n chen) enhances 
this damp-heat clearing action, thereby improving the 
passage of stool and urine by removing this pathogenic 
impediment. This is helpful in the early stage of damp-
heat jaundice when heat is stronger than dampness with 
such symptoms as fever, urinary difficulty, constipation 
or incomplete bowel movements, and abdominal disten-
tion. At this stage, one can use Rhei Radix et Rhizoma ( dii 
huang) even in the absence of overt constipation; however, 
it should be decocted fully, rather than adding it later in the 
decocting process. This will serve to clear the damp-heat, 
with little irritation to the bowel. 
Comparisons 
);;-- Vs. LYSIMACHIAE HERBA (j!n qian cao) 
Both herbs cool heat, facilitate the removal of dampness, 
clear Liver heat, and benefit the Gallbladder, and thus are 
often combined when damp-heat affects these two organs. 
However, Lysimachiae Herba (j!n qian cao) is sweet, salty, 
and slightly cold, with a tendency to soften hardness, expel 
stones, and assist the Gallbladder. By contrast, Artemisiae 
scopariae Herba (y!n chen) is bitter, cold, descending and 
draining, and much more fragrant than Lysimachiae Herba 
(jln qian cao); these properties enable it to better break up 
turbid dampness. It thereby reduces jaundice and promotes 
urination, and assists the Liver more than the Gallbladder. 
);;-- Vs. ARTEMISIAE ANNUAE HERBA (qlng hew) 
Both herbs are aromatic and resolve damp-heat. They are 
commonly used together in the treatment of jaundice due 
to damp-heat, damp-warm disorders, and summerheat-
warmth. However, Artemisiae scopariae Herba (yin chen) 


312 
4 I Herbs that Drain Dampness 
enters the Spleen and Stomach and is specific for jaundice. 
By contrast, Artemisiae annuae Herb a ( qfng hao) primarily 
enters the Liver and Gallbladder, and is better for resolving 
steaming bones due to consumption. It is particularly good 
for draining pathogenic fire in summerheat-warmth, and 
for malarial disorders. 
Traditional Contraindications 
Although Artemisiae scopariae Herba (yin chen) is a 
major herb for jaundice, it is still necessary to differentiate 
between yin jaundice and yang jaundice. Artemisiae sco-
pariae Herba (yin chen) is appropriate for yang jaundice, 
but yin jaundice requires warm tonification. If Artemisiae 
scopariae Herba (yin chen) is used anyway, [the injury is] 
often irreparable. Artemisiae scopariae Herba (yin chen) 
cannot be used for jaundice due to blood accumulation. 
(Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
Within the normal dosage range no side effects are to be 
expected. Rare cases of toxic effects have been reported 
following the ingestion of relatively high doses of the herb 
(15-30g), with symptoms including headache, dizziness, 
numbness and tremor of the upper extremities, fainting, an 
oppressive feeling in the chest, and palpitations. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
The tender young stems and leaves are cleaned of extrane-
ous material and dried; this is also known as ~ f~ yfn chen. 
Generally, the younger sprouts harvested in springtime are 
considered superior, and this is specified in the prescrip-
tion by the term tender capillaris (:iji ~ f~ nen yin chen). 
Young, silvery grey leaves, curled and often resembling cot-
ton buds, are called flossy capillaris (~* ~ 
f~ midn yin chen 
or simply ~* f~ midn chen). While some consider this to be 
slightly inferior, others prefer it. It is usually grown in the 
vicinity of Nanjing. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of young, soft, greyish white, and 
intensely aromatic seedlings.

Additional product information 
Originally, ·** 00 r-t mian yin chen (seedlings of Artemisia capillaris) 
and :11:. "00 ~-it bei yin chen (seedlings of Artemisia scoparia) could be 
found on the market. There is an old proverb: "In the third month, 
they are capillaris seedlings, in the fourth month, an herb. If cut 
in the fifth month, they are only fit for firewood." Despite this, in 
recent years (since 1990) the whole plant harvested in autumn 
has also entered the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Nowadays, depend-
ing on the time of harvest, two different products can be distin-
guished. The first is fo.* 00 ~t mian yin chen, which are seedlings, 
1.5-2.5cm long, cut in the spring. The second is 00 ~t ~ yin chen 
hi'io, the whole aerial part of the plant, cut in autumn. The best 
quality is said to come from Sanyuan in Shaanxi province.
