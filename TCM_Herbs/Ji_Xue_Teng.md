10 I Herbs that Regulate the Blood 
feeling in the hands, shortness of breath, anxiety, tachy-
cardia, nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal symptoms. 
These symptoms gradually disappear, usually without ter-
minating treatment. Allergic reactions affecting the skin 
and respiratory system have also been reported. There is 
one known case of liver damage, and two cases of shock, 
reported after injection of preparations made from this 
herb. These preparations may also provoke headache. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "cinnabar root" 
Because the outer bark of the plant is purplish black or deep 
red, it is also known as purple salvia ( 'JJ.~ ff- ~ z{ dan shen), 
crimson salvia ( i/Fff- ~ chi dan shen), or blood salvia ( .rlu.. ff-
~ xue dan shen). 
)> DRY- FRIED SALVIA (;J:.:J-·ff- ~ chao dan shen) 
The root is dry-fried until slightly scorched, which modi-
fies its nature to slightly warming and more moderate in 
its actions, allowing it to both nourish and invigorate the 
blood with less of a blood-cooling effect. This is best for 
cases of blood deficiency or blood stagnation without any 
signs of heat. 
)> WINE-FRI ED SALVIA (5@ ;.l:j· fj- ~ jiu chao dan shen) 
The root slices are mixed with yellow rice wine, left cov-
ered briefly as it is absorbed, then dry-fried until deep 
yellow in color. This method of preparation utilizes the 
acrid-dispersing quality of the wine to increase the root's 
ability to invigorate the blood and dispel stasis. It is mainly 
used to treat disorders such as dysmenorrhea, postpartum 
abdominal pain, and abdominal masses. 
)> TURTLE- BLOOD SALVIA ( f .rlu.. 4:f- ff- ~ 
bze xue bim dan shen) 
The fresh blood of the Chinese soft-shelled turtle (Amyda 
sinensis) is mixed with the herb until the roots are satu-
rated; they are then dried in the sun. This method has the 
effect of better guiding the herb into the Liver blood and 
also moderating its adverse bitter and drying qualities. It 
is used primarily for cases of blood stasis associated with 
Liver blood or Liver yin deficiency. 
)> CHARRED SAL VIA ( ff- ~ 
,£ dan shen tim) 
The root slices are dry-fried at a high temperature until the 
exterior is blackened, then cooled by spraying with water. 
This method retains the herb's property of invigorating the 
blood, but enables it to stop bleeding. In this ability to both 
invigorate the blood and stop bleeding, it is quite similar 
to Notoginseng Radix (san qz), but inexpensive and more 
readily available. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of large, thick, purplish red, unfrag-
mented roots with thin bark and without root heads or fine 
hairy roots.

Additional product information 
Several different commercial products can be distinguished: salvia 
(fl-t- dan shen), generally Salvia miltiorrhiza, southern salvia ('*:I 
fJ-t- nan dan shen), Gansu salvia (it :l fJ-t- gan si.J dan shen), 
Sichuan salvia (Jil fl-t- chuan dan shen), which is identical to 
salvia, and assembled salvia (~fl-t- hui dan shen), which usually 
comes from Sichuan but includes both rhizomes and roots. 
The best quality is cultivated Sichuan salvia; assembled salvia is 
generally thought to be of inferior quality.

CAUTIONS & CONTRAINDICATIONS 
Contraindicated in those 
with profuse menses. 
Actions & Indications 
• Promotes the movement of and tonifies the blood: for 
blood deficiency patterns presenting with such problems 
as dysmenorrhea, irregular menstruation, or amenorrhea 
accompanied by abdominal pain. 
-
With Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu dl huang), 
Paeoniae Radix alba (btii shtio), and Angelicae sinensis 
Radix ( diing gul) for blood deficiency after traumatic injury 
or chemotherapy for tumors, as in Tangkuei and Jixueteng 
Decoction (dang guf jf xue teng tiing). 
• Invigorates the channels and relaxes the sinews: for numb-
ness of the extremities, lower back pain, knee pain, or gen-
eralized joint soreness from wind-damp painful obstruc-
tion, with either blood deficiency or stasis. Also used for 
weakness of the extremities in the elderly or paralysis and 
vertigo due to blood stasis or wind-stroke. 
-
With Taxilli Herba (siing jl sheng) and Achyranthis 
bidentatae Radix (niu xl) for wind-damp painful obstruc-
tion, especially chronic painful obstruction in women and 
the elderly where there is also blood deficiency. 
- With Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (qiiing hu6) and 
Trachelospermi Caulis (luo shi ten g) for painful obstruction 
with significant aspects of blood stasis. 
- With Salviae miltiorrhizae Radix (diin shen) and Eu-
commiae Cortex ( du zhang) for weakness, numbness, 
and paralysis of the limbs, as well as vertigo, associ-
ated with wind-stroke. Appropriate once the condition has 
stabilized. 
Commentary 
Spatholobi Caulis (j! xue teng) has a number of special 
characteristics: it invigorates but also tonifies the blood; 
it acts internally as an important gynecological herb to 
regulate menstruation and treat dysmenorrhea and post-
partum pain; and it particularly unblocks blood circulation 
through the channels and collaterals affecting the sinews, 
so that it treats numbness and paralysis of the extremities, 
pain in the lower back and knees, and pain due to wind-
damp painful obstruction. 
Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica states 
that it "invigorates the blood and disbands [stagnation in 
the] collaterals. Because it is naturally a vine, and its color 
contains red, one look shows that it specifically enters the 
blood level." 
This herb was first noted in Omissions from the Grand 
Materia Medica: 
treats blood deficiency in elderly people causing numbness 
or paralysis of the hands and feet, as well as wind pain, 
and damp painful obstruction; male deficiency leading to 
infertility and white turbid spermatorrhea; cold pain in the 
Stomach in both males and females; irregular menstruation 
and red-and-white vaginal discharge; dry, exhausted blood 
in women and cold from deficiency in the Womb causing 
infertility. 
Comparisons 
).> Vs. ANGELI CAE SINENSIS RADIX (diing gul) 
Both herbs tonify and invigorate the blood, stop pain, and 
regulate menstruation. However, Angelicae sinensis Radix 
(diing gul) primarily tonifies the blood, and secondarily 
invigorates the blood; it also moistens the Intestines and 
thus treats constipation. By contrast, Spatholobi Caulis (j! 
xue teng) primarily invigorates the blood, while also tonify-
ing. It also invigorates the collaterals and soothes the sin-
ews, so that it treats numbness and paralysis of the extremi-
ties, and wind-damp painful obstruction disorders.
