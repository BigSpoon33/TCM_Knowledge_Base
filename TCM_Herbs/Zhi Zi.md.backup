## 📖 Overview

Zhou Yan says that this is "an herb of the Heart, Lungs, Liver, and Stomach" but that "its therapeutic effect is more in the Heart, Liver, and Stomach, and less in the Lungs." Other writers include the Triple Burner channel. It is bitter, cold, and downward-directing in nature, but the downward precipitation is gradual. It is best at cooling fire and heat in the Heart, Lungs, Stomach, Liver, and Triple Burner, eliminating hot irritability in situations such as warm pathogen diseases with agitation and insomnia. Gardeniae Fructus (*zhi zi*) is also good for clearing damp-heat, and is used for jaundice and urinary difficulty, guiding damp-heat out through the urine. Constraint is key here, as explained by Zhou Yan:

[It is] bitter and cold and eliminates heat; the heat that it eliminates is a static, constrained heat, not a floating, dispersed heat, nor a hard, clumped heat. It is able to resolve constraint, but not attack hardness; nor is it able to calm the rebellious. For these reasons, it is not used for the *yang ming* condition of abdominal fullness with dried stools, nor is it used for the coughing and rebellion of exterior heat in Lung diseases.

Zhu Dan-Xi observed that it "drains Triple Burner fire, cools epigastric heat, treats sensations of heat and pain in the cardiac region, dissipates pent-up heat, and mobilizes clumped *qi*." After noting that it is an essential herb for the treatment of heat in the chest, he explained that it has "a tremendous ability to drain fire downward and out through the urine, as by nature it winds its way downward."

The noted contemporary physician Zhu Liang-Chun used the dried form of this herb as the primary ingredient in formulas for pancreatitis, as he considered it particularly useful for the key pathologies he saw in this problem: damp-heat affecting the Spleen and Stomach, then transforming into fire. His view is that the herb drains fire in the three burners, and is able to enter both the *qi* aspect, where it clears heat and drains fire, as well as the blood aspect, where it cools and moves the blood. For this purpose, he combined it with such herbs as Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (*da huang*), Taraxaci Herba (*pu gong ying*), Curcumae Radix (*yu jin*), Patriniae Herba (*bai jiang cao*), and Persicae Semen (*tao ren*). When oral administration is not practicable, he recommends using a nasogastric tube or enema.
