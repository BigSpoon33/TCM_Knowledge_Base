## 📖 Overview

Acrid, and thereby dispersing, bitter, and thereby downward-directing, very warm but violently drying, Evodiae Fructus (wu zhu yu) is best at warming the Liver and Stomach to stop nausea, but is also very effective for dredging Liver constraint, promoting the movement of qi, and alleviating pain. It appears in several classical formulas in Shang Han Lun (傷寒論 shang han lun) and Jin Gui Yao Lue (金匱要略 jin gui yao lue), where it is used to disperse cold, direct rebellion downward, alleviate pain, and warm the yang. In the middle burner, its major indications involve nausea and vomiting, particularly of turbid thin fluid, due to cold from deficiency of the Spleen and Stomach. When headache is involved, this is usually a vertex headache that includes the temples, and is due to Liver cold accosting the Stomach, causing turbid yin to rebel upward. Zhang Zhong-Jing relied on its acrid warmth to disperse cold in the middle burner, and its bitter flavor to direct rebellious turbid yin downward, in the formula Evodia Decoction (wu zhu yu tang).

This herb warms the Liver and relieves constraint from pathogenic cold, and thus promotes the movement of qi and alleviates pain. In the Jin Gui Yao Lue it is used to treat pain in the chest, combined with other warming herbs. Later generations prescribed it for painful bulging disorders along the Liver channel. In gynecology, it is used for lower burner cold causing irregular menstruation, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. See, for example, the Jin Gui Yao Lue formula Warm the Menses Decoction (wen jing tang).

In Ben Cao Bian Du (本草便讀 ben cao bian du), Zhang Bing Cheng states that the herb is acrid, bitter, and warm, aromatic and drying. It is basically a Liver governing herb, but also enters the Spleen and Stomach, because the Spleen likes aromatic dryness, and the Stomach likes downward-direction. By nature, its downward-directing of qi is most rapid, and it remarkably disseminates and spreads what has been constrained and clumped. It therefore treats constrained stagnation of Liver qi which has allowed cold turbidity to reside below, causing such conditions as abdominal pain, bulging disorders, and fixed abdominal masses. In cases where the pathogenic disorder has moved downward to an extreme, and thereafter ascends, where it forms nausea, vomiting, acid regurgitation, and sensations of fullness in the chest—it can treat all of these.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Because this is extremely drying and can consume the qi and perturb fire, it should not be consumed long term. Contraindicated when yin deficiency leads to heat signs.
Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing Shu (神農本草經疏 shen nong ben cao jing shu) gives careful directions regarding the contraindications of this herb, laid out by symptom:

For vomiting or acid regurgitation, it must be due to externally-contracted pathogenic wind-cold, or to dormant cold phlegm or harbored pathogenic water. [It] must not be used for vomiting or acid regurgitation due to Stomach fire.

For abdominal pain, it cannot be due to blood deficiency with fire.

For bulging disorders, it must be due to pathogenic cold, and furthermore should be the first or second time the bulging has occurred, when deficiency has not yet become a factor.

Its standard proscriptions include all yin deficiency patterns, and those with heat rather than cold in the organs.
