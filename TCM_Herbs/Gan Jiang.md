## 📖 Overview

The older winter rhizome used for Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jiang) is considered the 'mother' rhizome, in contrast to the young, tender summer rhizome used for Zingiberis Rhizoma recens (sheng jiang), which is the 'child'. It is yellowish white in color, acrid, warm and drying, and quite solid in texture. All of these qualities indicate an affiliation with Spleen earth, and secondarily with the Lungs. It is the principal herb for warming the middle burner. Its ability to disperse is less intense, but also more prolonged, than raw ginger, and is thus said to both conserve and mobilize. It revives the yang and unblocks the channels in the treatment of wind-damp painful obstruction, and also warms the Lungs and transforms thin mucus in the treatment of cough and wheezing due to cold, thin mucus accosting the Lungs.

Pouch of Pearl describes the actions of this herb:

The uses of Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jiang) are four [in number]. First, it unblocks and assists the Heart yang. Second, it expels stubborn sunken cold in the organs. Third, it disperses cold qi in all the channels. Fourth, it treats abdominal pain due to externally-contracted cold.

When fried black, it enters the Kidneys and acts at the blood level. Prepared in this manner, Zingiberis Rhizoma preparatum (pao jiang) is no longer acrid, but has become bitter; its nature is warm and harmonious, and its primary actions are warming the middle, stopping diarrhea, and stopping bleeding due to yang qi deficiency. Because of this warming, consolidating, and moderate effect, Zhang Yuan-Su said that it "conserves without mobilizing."

In Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, Zhang Jie Bin noted:

If overabundant yin separates from yang so that fire cannot return to its base, or deficient yang is unable to contain the blood, causing spitting up of blood, nosebleed, or bleeding from below, then [dried ginger] should be thoroughly dry-fried (yet not to the extent of losing its form) and used: it is the most important herb for stopping [this kind of] bleeding.

Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica observes:

Whenever there is cold from deficiency of the Stomach, and the primal yang is about to be cut off, use [Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jiang)] together with Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi), and it can immediately revive the yang. This is why textbooks all include the sentence 'Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi) without Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jiang) is not hot.'

This passage goes on to list the large number of formulas in which the two herbs are combined.

## ⚡ Functions & Actions

-   **Warms the middle and expels cold:** for warming the Spleen and Stomach both in conditions of excess due to externally-contracted cold, as well as cold from deficiency due to insufficiency of the yang qi. Also dispels wind and dampness that seep into the lower burner.
    -   With Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu) for diarrhea associated with Spleen deficiency. Char both herbs for treating bloody stools and excessive uterine bleeding.
    -   Add Ginseng Radix (ren shen) for Spleen yang deficiency with a cold abdomen, vomiting, and diarrhea, as in Regulate the Middle Pill (li zhong wan).
    -   With Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi) for debilitated Spleen and Kidney yang with incessant diarrhea.
    -   With Coptidis Rhizoma (huang lian) for epigastric pain and distention, dysenteric disorders, and indefinable epigastric discomfort. The latter is a disorder characterized by a feeling of hunger, vague abdominal pain or discomfort, sometimes accompanied by belching, distention, and nausea which gradually culminates in pain.
    -   Add Asini Corii Colla (e jiao) for chronic diarrhea with damage to the yin leading to a condition with mixed hot and cold and blood and pus in the stool.
    -   With Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhi ban xia) for vomiting due to cold-induced congested fluids.
    -   With Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cao) for epigastric pain and vomiting due to cold from deficiency of the Stomach and Spleen.
    -   With Alpiniae officinarum Rhizoma (gao liang jiang) for abdominal pain and vomiting due to Stomach cold.
    -   With Poria (fu ling) and Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu) for cold-dampness in the lower burner leading to a sense of heaviness and cold in the lower back, as in Licorice, Ginger, Poria, and White Atractylodes Decoction (gan cao gan jiang fu ling bai zhu tang).
-   **Rescues devastated yang and expels interior cold:** for devastated yang with such signs as a very weak pulse and cold limbs.
    -   With Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi) for devastated yang. Not only does this combination have a synergistic warming effect, it also reduces the toxicity of the aconite. See Frigid Extremities Decoction (si ni tang).
-   **Warms the Lungs and transforms thin mucus:** because this herb warms the Spleen and dries dampness while simultaneously scattering cold in the Lungs, it is used for Lung cold with expectoration of thin, watery, or white sputum.
    -   With Schisandrae Fructus (wu wei zi) and Asari Radix et Rhizoma (xi xin) for cough and wheezing due to cold congested fluids preventing the normal descent of the Lung qi, as in Minor Bluegreen Dragon Decoction (xiao qing long tang).
    -   With Gleditsiae Fructus (zao jiao) for rebellious qi leading to cough.
    -   With Magnoliae officinalis Cortex (hou po) for epigastric distention and pain due to cold-induced congealed fluids.
-   **Warms the channels and stops bleeding:** for cold from deficiency that may present with hemorrhage of various types, especially uterine bleeding. It is used in treating hemorrhage only if the bleeding is chronic and pale in color, and is accompanied by cold limbs, ashen white face, and a soggy, thin pulse. For bleeding, usually Zingiberis Rhizoma preparatum (pao jiang) is used.
    -   With Artemisiae argyi Folium (ai ye) and Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (bai zhu) for bleeding due to cold from deficiency.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated when there is internal heat from yin deficiency or when heat in the blood leads to bleeding. Use with caution during pregnancy.

Traditional Contraindications:

"Excessive use will exhaust the primal qi [because] acridity disperses it, this is because strong fire consumes qi-it should be moderated with unprepared Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cao)." (Grand Materia Medica, quoting Li Gao)

"It should not be consumed during pregnancy ... because (Detailed Materia Medica) it is hot and dispersing."

"It can disperse qi and disturb the blood, injure the yin and damage the eyes, and its standard contraindications include yin deficiency with internal heat, coughing up blood, deficiency of the exterior with hot sweating, spontaneous sweating, nightsweats, rectal bleeding due to internal accumulation of heat, nausea due to heat, and abdominal pain from heat or fire."
