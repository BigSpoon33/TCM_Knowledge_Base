6 I Herbs that Transform Phlegm and Stop Coughing 
Lungs have fire from excess. Its nature is not entirely ben-
eficial, so it should not be overused. It is forbidden in those 
with Lung deficiency and excessive urination, and also for 
cough from externally-contracted wind-cold. (Harm and 
Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "mulberry white bark" 
:;;... PREPARED MuLBERRY RooT BARK 
( 5<..% s It zhl sang btii pi) 
Also simply known as 5<..% It zhl sang pi, the herb is mixed 
with warm honey and water, then left to soak briefly before 
baking or frying over moderate heat until yellow in color 
and no longer sticky. Preparing the herb with honey miti-
gates its cooling and draining properties, preventing any 
damage to the Lung qi. It also increases its ability to moist-
en the Lungs and calm wheezing. Two common formulas 
that call for this method of preparation are Drain the White 
Powder (xie btii san) and Arrest Wheezing Decoction (dlng 
chuan tang). 
:;;... DRY-FRIED MoRI CoRTEX (sang btii pi) 
(#'% s Jt chao sang btii pi) 
Also simply known as ~;);%It chao sang pi, the herb is 
baked or fried until slightly scorched. Although this meth-
od of preparation helps reduce the herb's coldness, it also 
means that its ability to drain the Lungs and facilitate the 
movement of water is not as good as untreated Mori Cortex 
(sang btii pi); moreover, its actions in moistening and calm-
ing wheezing are not as good as prepared mulberry root 
bark. For these reasons, this method is rarely used.

DOSAGE 
3-9g 
CAUTIONS & CONTRAINDICATIONS 
Contraindicated in those 
with wheezing from Lung deficiency, swelling from Spleen 
deficiency, or urinary dysfunction from Bladder qi defi-
ciency, unless combined with herbs that tonify the Spleen 
and augment the qi. See ToxiCITY below. 
Actions & Indications 
• Drains the Lungs, reduces phlegm, and calms wheezing: for 
excess-type wheezing or cough with copious sputum and a 
gurgling sound in the throat due to phlegm accumulation 
or Lung heat. 
-
With Jujubae Fructus (da zao) for cough, excessive spu-
tum, wheezing, and chest pain due to phlegm preventing 
the normal descent of Lung qi, as in Lepidium/Descurainia 
and Jujube Decoction to Drain the Lungs (ting ll da zao xie 
foi tiing). 
• Moves water and reduces edema: for facial edema or fluid 
accumulation in the chest or abdomen with urinary dif-
ficulty due to excess-type obstruction of the Lung and 
Bladder qi. 
-
With Stephaniae tetrandrae Radix (han fangji) and Rhei 
Radix et Rhizoma (da huang) for facial edema and fluid 
accumulation in the chest and abdomen, as in Stephania, 
Zanthoxylum, Lepidium/Descurainia, and Rhubarb Pills 
(ji jiiio ll huang wan). 
-
With Rhei Radix et Rhizoma ( da huang) and Armeniacae 
Semen (xlng ren) for hardness, fullness, and pain in the 
chest due to clumping, as in Major Sinking into the Chest 
Pill (da xian xiong wan). 
-
With Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhl fu zi) and 
Astragali Radix (huang qi) for congestive heart failure or 
cardiopulmonary disease with reduced urination, edema of 
the face and orbits, and wheezing. 
Commentary 
Bitter-descending, acrid-dispersing, Lepidii/Descurainiae 
Semen ( ting ll zi) is cold and enters the qi level of the Lungs 
in order to drain Lung excess. The Lungs are the upper 
source of fluid metabolism; therefore, disturbance in the 
flow of Lung qi can result in accumulation of pathogenic 
water and phlegm. Lepidii/Descurainiae Semen (ting ll zi) 
is well-suited for managing this disorder. An ancient adage 
says that "Acute sensations of fullness in the chest due to 
water qi within the Lung cannot be eliminated without this 
[herb]." Thus, Lepidii/Descurainiae Semen (ting ll zi) is 
specifically indicated whenever cough and wheezing is due 
to phlegm and thin mucus obstructing the Lung qi, and 
especially when the patient feels worse when lying fiat, the 
bowel movements and urine fail to move freely, and edema 
appears in the chest and abdomen. However, it should not 
be used in cases of deficiency. 
Materia Medica of Combinations notes that Lepidii/ 
Descurainiae Semen (ting ll zi) 
strongly drains qi closure at the yang levels; in the lower 
body it drains heat lodged in the Bladder. It can treat 
phlegm and thin mucus in the area of the diaphragm. 
Labored breathing from water qi in the Lungs can only be 
eliminated with this herb; since clumped pathogenic water 
results from hot qi, only this can clear it. When combined 
with Jujubae Fructus (da zao), it can treat clogged Lungs 
without injuring the Stomach [because of its strong action 
in draining downward]. 
Zhang Shan-Lei objected to what he regarded as an exces-
sive emphasis on the injuriousness of Lepidii/Descurainiae 
Semen (ting ll zi): 
[Zhu] Dan-Xi also records the view that Lepidii/ 
Descurainiae Semen (ting ll zi) is agitating, so if an illness 
involves deficiency [the use of this herb] will very promptly 
kill the patient. This made the average person who does not 
differentiate true from false fear it like a snake or a scor-
pion. 
Zhang goes on to say that the herb "is very light in weight, 
therefore its actions can travel upward to enter the Lungs; 
its flavor is also extremely bland-how could it be violent 
to such an extent?" He noted that the true nature of this 
herb could be summed up in two words-unbinding (Fn"l 
kiii) and draining (;i!t xie)-and that while he and oth-
ers had long observed its clinical benefits, he had never 
heard of it actually injuring the Lungs or the Spleen. He 
concluded with a protest that physicians should not just 
be theorists, but should have a practical understanding of 
the physical qualities and characteristics of the herbs they 
prescribe: "Physicians these days no longer do the job of 
collecting their own herbs, but depend solely on empty 
words on paper." 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
:;;. WITH JUJUBAE FRUCTUS (da zao) 
This is a very old combination, dating from the third-cen-
tury Golden Cabinet. The sweet warmth ofJujubae Fructus 
(da zao) moderates the intense bitter-cold draining action 
of Lepidii/Descurainiae Semen (ting ll zi) and protects the 
Spleen and Stomach, so that the draining action ofLepidii/ 
Descurainiae Semen (ting ll zi) does not injure the normal 
qi. Furthermore, by assisting the middle qi, the fluid-regu-
lating action of Lepidii/Descurainiae Semen (ting ll zi) is 
enhanced. Thus, while the pair combines violence with 
gentleness, and tonification with draining, the ultimate 
result is highly effective in cases of fullness in the chest, 
wheezing, and cough which worsens when lying fiat. It is

6 I Herbs that Transform Phlegm and Stop Coughing 
also good for facial edema and a sonorous blocked nose. 
However, this pair of herbs should not be used in a 
large dosage: 6g of Lepidii/Descurainiae Semen (ting ll 
zi) and lOg of Jujubae Fructus (da zcw) are customary. In 
addition, it should not be used for long periods of time, to 
avoid injuring the Lung qi and causing a recurrence of the 
wheezing. 
>-- WITH PERILLAE FRUCTUS (zi SU zi); see page 445 
Comparisons 
>-- Vs. EPHEDRAE HERBA (mahuang) 
Both herbs calm wheezing, and both open the upper source 
of fluids (Lungs) in order to facilitate the flow of fluids and 
reduce edema. However, Lepidii/Descurainiae Semen (ting 
ll zi) is bitter, cold, and drains downward with a powerful 
Lung-draining, water-mobilizing action, and is best suited 
for excess phlegm and thin mucus leading to cough and 
wheezing with edema in the chest and abdomen. By con-
trast, Ephedrae Herba (mahuang) is acrid, slightly bitter, 
and warm; it opens and disseminates the Lung qi to dis-
perse wind-cold. It is best used for wind-cold binding the 
Lungs and causing cough and wheezing, or Lung qi failing 
to mobilize the fluids, resulting in edema, specifically the 
disorder known as wind-water. 
>-- Vs. MoRr CoRTEX (sang bai pi); see page 451 
Traditional Contraindications 
Although it is an important herb for draining the Lungs, 
facilitating urination, and treating swelling and fullness, its 
flavor is still bitter and very cold, and its nature is intensely 
mobilizing without restraint. While draining the Lungs, 
it readily injures the Stomach, and should not be used for 
those with Spleen and Stomach weakness or actual yin 
deficiency. It is prohibited for swelling and fullness due to 
Spleen deficiency unable to control water, allowing water qi 
to spread, and in those with urinary difficulty from Bladder 
deficiency with lack of qi transformation. 
Transgression of these prohibitions will cause a mild ill-
ness to become serious, and a serious illness to become 
life-threatening-one must be cautious. If spread upon 
sores on the head, the herb qi will enter the brain and kill 
the patient. There are two types, sweet and bitter; bitter is 
powerful, sweet is slightly more subdued, both should be 
accompanied by Jujubae Fructus (da zao) as a support. If a 
qi-deficient person takes this herb, calamity will loom close 
on his heels. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
High dosage or long-term use can induce excessive diuresis 
and cause hypokalemia. These seeds irritate the mucosa of 
the eyes, nose, and mouth, causing discomfort, swelling, 
and pain, and, in severe cases, blisters of the cornea. In very 
rare cases, allergic reactions have been reported with such 
symptoms as a feeling of oppression in the chest, obstruc-
tion ofbreathing, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, pruritus of the 
skin, restlessness, urticaria located on the neck area, thorax, 
and abdomen, pale face and lips, cold sweat, dyspnea, low 
blood pressure, shock. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
As discussed here, the seeds of two plants from different 
genera are used as this herb. Under most cirucmstances 
we would have a separate entry for each seed, but have 
followed the examples of the standard Chinese pharmaco-
logical texts and combined them here. These two products 
remain in one entry probably because the seeds from these 
cruciferae plants are very similar in shape and chemical 
composition. The two seeds are beginning to be differenti-
ated as follows: 
>-- SwEET ting ll zi (-Mt ¥ 7fl. -f- tian ting ll zi) 
Also known as southern ting ll zi ( ~ ¥ Jfl. -f- nan ting ll zi), 
this is Descurainiae Semen (tian ting ll zi), which is bland 
and relatively moderate in draining, with a more pro-
nounced action in draining the Lungs and calming wheez-
ing. The draining action of this herb does not injure the 
Stomach, and for that reason is generally preferred. 
Descurainiae Semen (tian ting ll zi), as a stand-alone 
herb (dry-fried), is prescribed in Effective Formulas from 
Generations of Physicians for Lung abscess with such symp-
toms as coughing up pus and blood, and wheezing that 
worsens when lying flat. 
>-- BITTER tfng fl zi (* ¥ Jfl. -f- ku tfng fl zi) 
Also known as northern ting ll zi (:ft.¥ Jfl. -f- bei ting ll zi), 
this is Lepidii Semen (bei ting ll zi), which has a more rapid 
draining action due to its more bitter flavor. It is specified 
for driving out thin mucus, mobilizing pathogenic water, 
and draining the Lungs, but can readily injure the Stomach 
qi. For this reason, the dosage should be carefully moni-
tored. It is often used for edema or ascites in the chest and 
abdomen. 
These seeds are often prepared before use in one of the 
following ways: 
>-- DRY-FRIED ting ll zi (:i:;!l ¥ 7il. -f- chao ting ll zi) 
With this method, the seeds are dry-fried over a moder-
ate flame until they just begin to jump and pop, and their 
aroma begins to emerge. This moderates the cold nature of 
the seeds and their potential to injure the Stomach, making 
this method of preparation very popular. In certain parts of 
China, only seeds prepared with this method are supplied 
whenever tfng ll zi is written in a prescription.
