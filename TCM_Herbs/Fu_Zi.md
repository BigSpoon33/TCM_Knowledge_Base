Commentary 
Kochiae Fructus (dl fu zi) is acrid, bitter, and cold; it clears, 
facilitates, dredges, and disperses. It primarily enters the 
Bladder channel, which governs the exterior of the body, 
and also the lower outlet of the fluid pathways. Kochiae 
Fructus (dl fu zi) mobilizes the exterior and thus alleviates 
itching by dispersing pathogenic wind in the muscle layer 
and skin. It also clears damp-heat internally and facilitates 
urination. Thus, it is often used, both internally and exter-
nally, for intense itching of the skin due to wind-dampness 
affecting the exterior in such disorders as eczema and sca-
bies, or damp-heat in the genitals. 
This herb is commonly used for urinary difficulty that 
is dark, scanty, burning, and painful due to accumulated 
damp-heat in the Bladder. Its ability to clear wind-heat 
enables it to treat swollen, painful eyes and head, or dizzi-
ness. 
Comparisons 
;...... V S. SOPHORAE FLA VESCENTIS RADIX (ku shen) 
Both herbs clear damp-heat, expel wind, and alleviate itch-
ing, and both facilitate urination. Thus, they are often used 
together in the treatment of itching skin disorders or gyne-
