## 📖 Overview

Ligustici Rhizoma (*gao ben*) has acrid, warm, ascending, and dispersing properties with a powerful aroma that is quite drying. Numerous texts record its ability to enter the Governing vessel as well as the Bladder channel; thus, it is particularly good for reaching the vertex of the head and treating all wind disorders involving the upper posterior aspect of the body.

The relationship of the Bladder channel and Governing vessel with the Kidneys, however, also allows Ligustici Rhizoma (*gao ben*) to treat lower backache and gynecological masses, vaginal swelling, or pain from wind-dampness in the interior of the body, as well as relieving headaches involving the teeth. It also relieves acute abdominal pain and diarrhea associated with lower abdominal wind-dampness. Its wind-expelling quality is best expressed in the upper body, while its ability to dry dampness comes more into play in the lower body.

*Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica* observes that "Whenever using Ligustici Rhizoma (*gao ben*) to treat headaches at the vertex, it should be combined with Saposhnikoviae Radix (*fang feng*) plus wine-fried Cimicifugae Rhizoma (*sheng ma*) and Bupleuri Radix (*chai hu*)." Wine-frying the latter two herbs enhances their ability to lift the clear yang.

When considering Ligustici Rhizoma (*gao ben*) in the treatment of headache at the vertex, remember that pain in this area can also occur secondary to a terminal yin disorder, for which this herb would be inappropriate. Additional signs and symptoms of a terminal yin disorder include dry retching, vomiting of thin sputum, cold hands and feet, and sometimes diarrhea. The treatment should be to warm and soothe the Stomach and Liver, which will dispel the excess yin that is preventing the clear yang from rising. Evodia Decoction (*wu zhu yu tang*) is the appropriate treatment. As Ligustici Rhizoma (*gao ben*) works at the vertex to eliminate pathogenic wind-cold, rather than dispel excess yin, it should be avoided in these circumstances.

## ⚡ Functions & Actions

*   **Discharges exterior conditions and disperses cold:** For externally-contracted wind-cold, and especially for headache and nasal congestion, as in Magnolia Flower Powder (*xin yi san*). By itself it is used for wind-cold lodged in the greater yang with headache involving the crown and vertex, or linked to the teeth and jaw.
    *   With Asari Radix et Rhizoma (*xi xin*) for headache caused by wind-cold-dampness, headache occurring at the vertex, stiff neck, or toothache.
    *   With Chuanxiong Rhizoma (*chuan xiong*) and Angelicae Dahuricae Radix (*bai zhi*) to accentuate its pain-relieving action. These three herbs are often used together in treating headaches.
    *   With Angelicae Dahuricae Radix (*bai zhi*) as a face cream for wind and/or dampness affecting the face manifesting as acne, rosacea, or dandruff. This combination can also be used, when appropriate, to enhance the complexion.
*   **Dispels wind, overcomes dampness, and alleviates pain:** For wind-cold-damp painful obstruction as well as acute lower back pain due to invasion of wind-cold, as it treats both ends of the vessel, as in Notopterygium Decoction to Overcome Dampness (*qiang huo sheng shi tang*). Also used for dampness affecting the digestive system.
    *   With Atractylodis Rhizoma (*cang zhu*) for back pain and joint pain associated with the initial stage of painful obstruction.
    *   With Notopterygii Rhizoma seu Radix (*qiang huo*) for headache and stiffness of the nape of the neck due to wind-dampness in the Governing vessel.
    *   With Cyperi Rhizoma (*xiang fu*) for epigastric pain from dampness obstructing the qi dynamic with a greasy sensation in the mouth, excessive saliva, dull aching in the epigastrium and flanks, and loose stools.
    *   With Evodiae Fructus (*wu zhu yu*) for abdominal pain and bulging disorders due to cold-dampness. Often used together with Foeniculi Fructus (*xiao hui xiang*).
