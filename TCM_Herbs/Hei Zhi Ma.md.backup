## 📖 Overview

Sweet, neutral, rather oily, and black, *Sesami Semen nigrum* (*hei zhi ma*) enters the Liver and Kidney channels to tonify the yin and blood, brighten the eyes, blacken the hair, moisten the skin, and lubricate the Intestines. Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica says that it is "harmonious in nature and flavor, neither hot nor cold; it is an excellent food that augments the Spleen and Stomach, and tonifies the Liver and Kidneys." For promoting lactation, the Grand Materia Medica recommends that the herb be dry-fried, mixed with a bit of salty water, and eaten.

The eighth-century book Ri Materia Medica of Hua-Z observes that it:

"Tonifies the middle, augments the qi, and nourishes the five yin organs so that it treats consumption, emaciation, and fatigue during the postpartum period, promotes resistance to extremes in temperature, and alleviates palpitations. It drives out wind-dampness, roving wind, and head wind."

Liu Wan-Su explains: "To treat wind, first treat the blood; when the blood is invigorated, then wind will be expelled. [This herb] enters the Liver and augments the blood, and thus cannot be omitted from herbs that treat wind."
