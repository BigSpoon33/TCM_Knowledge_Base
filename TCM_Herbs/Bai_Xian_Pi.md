With Moutan Cortex (mu dan pf), Rhei Radix et Rhi-
zoma (da huang), Forsythiae Fructus (lidn qiao), and 
Taraxaci Herba (pu gong yzng) for Intestinal abscess. 
-
With Lonicerae Flos (jfn yin hua), Violae Herba (z! huii 
dl ding), and Taraxaci Herba (pu gongyfng) for abscess and 
swelling due to heat toxin. 
• Invigorates the blood and disperses stasis: for trauma, dys-
menorrhea, and joint pain. 
-
With Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang guf), Paeoniae 
Radix rubra (chi shao), Trogopterori Faeces (wu ling zhf), 
and Typhae Pollen (pu huang) for blood stasis causing such 
problems as post-traumatic pain or dysmenorrhea. 
Commentary 
Sargentodoxae Caulis (hong teng) is bitter and neutral, and 
enters the Liver and Large Intestine channels. It is best for 
clearing heat, resolving toxicity, reducing abscesses, and 
dispersing clumps. Because it enters the Large Intestine 
channel, and disperses stasis and blockage within the 
Intestine itself, it is an important herb for treating Intestinal 
abscess. It also invigorates the blood and stops pain, and 
thus can be used for the swelling and pain of breast abscess, 
menstrual pain, pain from trauma, and the pain of wind-
damp painful obstruction. The Illustrated Classic of the 
Materia Medica says that it "invigorates the blood, and 
treats qi lumps." 
Comparisons 
:;;;.. Vs. HOUTTUYNIAE HERBA (yu xfng cao) and 
P ATRINIAE HERB A (bai jiang cao) 
All three herbs are cooling, resolve toxicity, and have 
strong dispersing and blood-cooling actions. All of them 
are also specific for internal abscess. The main differences 
lie in the focus of their actions: Houttuyniae Herba (yu xfng 
cao) focuses on the Lungs, Patriniae Herba (bai jiang cao) 
on the Intestines, and Sargentodoxae Caulis (hong teng) on 
both the Intestines and the breasts. In addition, Patriniae 
Herba (bai jiang cao) and Sargentodoxae Caulis (hong ten g) 
are often used together to treat gynecological abdominal 
pain from blood stasis. 
;;;;. Vs. SPATHOLOBI CAuus (jfxue teng) 
Both herbs are frequently used for abdominal pain due 
to blood stasis, and are often combined for this purpose. 
However, Spatholobi Caulis (jf xue teng) unblocks the 
collaterals and invigorates the blood, which it also supple-
ments; it has a relatively gentle pain-stopping action. 
Sargentodoxae Caulis (hong teng) similarly invigorates the 
blood, but is more dispersing, cooling, and able to resolve 
toxicity. It is an essential herb for abdominal pain due to 
pelvic inflammation.

Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "red vine" 
This plant is often used for Spatholobi Caulis (jf xue ten g) in 
many parts of China, but the vine of Sargentodoxae Caul is 
(hong teng) is red throughout, with deeper red or brown 
veins, and thus is also known as large blood vine ( A..rlu.Ri 
da xue teng) or just blood vine ( .riu.ffi xue teng). Since at 
least 1985 it has been differentiated from Spatholobi Caul is 
(jf xue teng) in the official pharmacopoeia of the People's 
Republic of China.

Good quality consists of uniform pieces with a solid texture 
and distinct rays in the cross section.

Glycosides: salidroside, syringaresinol bisglucoside 
Organic acids: vanillic acid, protocatechuic acid, (+)-dihydro-
guaiaretic acid, stearic acid 
Other constituents: 8-sitosterol, daucosterol, p-hydroxyphenyl-
ethanol, p-hydroxyphenyl coumarate 
Adulterants 
Sargentodoxae Caul is (h6ng teng) is an adulterant of Spatholobii 
Caul is ($1!-.md¥,. jl xue teng). See COMPARISON and NOMENCLATURE

Actions & Indications 
• Clears heat, resolves fire toxicity, expels wind, and dries 
dampness: for wind-heat or damp-heat sores, carbuncles, 
and rashes. These are characterized by much pus or leak-
ing of a yellow fluid, moist skin, and pruritus. Also used 
(only in combination) for damp-heat jaundice or painful 
obstruction.

as scabies. These three herbs may be used together as an 
external wash.

Commentary 
Bitter and cold, Dictamni Cortex (bai xiiin pi) enters the 
blood, which it excels at mobilizing. It is best for expelling 
damp-heat that has accumulated in the blood vessels at the 
level of the muscles and flesh (as it enters the Spleen and 
Stomach), facilitating the movement of joints, and expel-
ling lower burner damp-heat. It takes heat out through 
the urine, and stops itching. It is particularly indicated 
for lower burner damp-heat and itching damp-heat skin 
disorders. It is often used in the treatment of wind-heat or 
damp-heat sores, carbuncles, and rashes marked by much 
pus or leaking of yellow fluid, moist skin, and pruritis. 
According to Li Shi-Zhen, this herb is also used for 
wind painful obstruction involved in jaundice. The Grand 
Materia Medica notes: "Dictamni Cortex (bai xiiin pi) is 
cold, mobilizing, bitter, and drying, and is an essential 
herb for jaundice with wind painful obstruction disorder. 
Doctors nowadays only use it for sores in external medi-
cine, but this is too shallow." Jaundice is basically a damp-
heat disorder; if the damp-heat is eliminated the jaundice 
will recede, followed by the wind painful obstruction asso-
ciated with it. 
In Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, 
Zhang Shan-Lei observes: 
Dictamni Cortex (bdi xiiin pf) is a bitter, cold herb that 
facilitates the expulsion of dampness, and also mobilizes 
and unblocks the channels, vessels, and collaterals. It is very 
intense in aroma and flavor, and can therefore penetrate 
above and below, unblocking and benefiting the joints, 
overcoming dampness and expelling heat, reaching all 
areas. 
In other words, Dictamni Cortex (bai xiiin pi) expels wind-
heat and damp-heat from the lower burner, as well as the 
skin and blood vessels of the muscles and flesh. It treats 
wind painful obstruction and damp painful obstruction 
disorders when they are associated with heat symptoms. 
Zhang elaborates on the therapeutic scope of the herb: 
Its roots spread widely, and enter deeply into the earth. 
Thus, in the limbs it disseminates and unblocks the chan-
nels and collaterals of the joints, internally it reaches the yin 
and yang organs and the bones, externally it mobilizes the 
muscles, flesh, and skin, above clearing wind-heat from the 
head and eyes, in the middle draining Spleen and Stomach 
damp-heat, while also promoting the [qi-transformative] 
dynamic that allows it to disseminate and transform pain-
ful obstruction .... Yet the common doctor nowadays only 
uses it for toxic damp sores of the skin-how can this suf-
fice as the sum total of its actions?

Comparisons 
~ Vs. SOPHORAE FLAVESCENTIS RADIX (ku shen) 
Both herbs eliminate damp-heat from the lower burner and 
the skin, and both promote urination. They are often used 
together in the treatment of eczema, damp sores, jaundice, 
and vaginal discharge. Sophorae flavescentis Radix (ku 
shen), however, possesses the ability to expel wind and 
kill parasites, and is thus superior for treating itching of 
the skin, vaginal discharge, and pruritis. Dictamni Cortex 
(blii xiiin pi) can enter the muscles and flesh to unblock 
the blood vessels and facilitate joint movement, and so can 
also be used for wind painful obstruction or damp painful 
obstruction with heat signs. 
Traditional Contraindications 
Zhang Shan-Lei cautions: 
Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians includes a pas-
sage that it 'can be used for women's postpartum pain.' 
This can be due to either blood stasis or blood deficiency, 
but neither is appropriate for bitter, cold herbs. Even if 
blood heat is present, Dictamni Cortex (bdi xiiin pi) is still 
not a crucial herb. Miao Xi-Yong has [rightly] remarked 
that if heat occurs with preexisting blood deficiency, the 
disorder is not amenable to Dictamni Cortex (bdi xiiin pi). 
Toxicity 
Dictamni Cortex (bdi xiiin pi) was involved in a series of 
cases involving liver damage in skin disease patients in the 
United Kingdom and New Zealand. Two of the patients 
died. There are no reports of hepatotoxicity of this herb 
in Chinese sources, but there is much evidence that a rare 
allergic hypersensitivity was the cause of these incidents 
abroad. The fact that there was a much more rapid adverse 
reaction in patients who resumed taking the herbs a sec-
ond time also suggests an allergic mechanism. Therefore, 
patients with atopic conditions such as eczema, or with a 
history ofliver disease, should be regarded as vulnerable to 
immunoallergic reactions of this kind. Caution should also 
be exercised if the substance is prescribed for patients with 
poor liver function.
