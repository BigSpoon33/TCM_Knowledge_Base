## 📖 Overview

Acrid, bitter, and very warming, Psoraleae Fructus (bu gu zhi) tonifies the yang of both the Spleen and Kidneys, and has an astringent nature that acts on the Kidneys to secure the primal yang, and on the Spleen to stop diarrhea. It is often used to treat impotence, spermatorrhea, urinary frequency, and pain due to cold in the lower back and legs, as well as diarrhea associated with Spleen and Kidney yang deficiency. It also assists the Kidneys in grasping the qi, and can be used in the treatment of cough and wheezing due to cold from deficiency. Soaked in wine and applied topically, it is used to treat vitiligo.

Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica explains that Psoraleae Fructus (bu gu zhi):

is an important herb to warm the water organ, generate yang from within yin, reinforce fire and augment earth ... because it warms the water organ, it tonifies fire to generate earth, which means that the true fire within the Kidneys is tonified so that it can ascend to ripen and cook water and grains, steam the dregs, and transform the subtle essence. Spleen qi disperses essence to rise upward into the Lungs, and thus all of the five organs are nourished.

When applied topically for vitiligo, the affected area should be exposed to daylight (approximately 10 minutes) or ultraviolet light (2-5 minutes). It should then be washed to prevent local skin reactions. These can include a macular rash or blisters. If these do occur, administration of the herb should cease.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Contraindicated in patterns of yin deficiency with heat signs or constipation. Although this herb can be hard on the Stomach, it is sometimes used, with caution, for cold from deficiency of the Stomach. See Toxicity below.

Traditional Contraindications

"Do not eat excessively [because they] disturb phlegm and thin mucus, making people nauseous so that they vomit water and food." (Important Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces)

"These are only appropriate for cold from deficiency, and should not be consumed by those with phlegm-fire or accumulated heat." (Detailed Materia Medica)

Its nature is drying and it assists fire; it is not to be taken when there is yin deficiency with fire blazing, excessive erections, spermatorrhea, blood in the urine, scanty, difficult urination, reddened eyes, bitter taste, dry tongue, and dry constipation, when internal heat causes thirst, or fire ascends causing indefinable epigastric discomfort, or damp-heat resulting in atrophy and weakness of the bones. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)

This book, and a number of other materia medica texts also state that Psoraleae Fructus (bu gu zhi) is contraindicated during pregnancy. However, in Readings in the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica, Chen Nian-Zu observes that "The reference to 'abortion' in the Materia Medica of the Kaibao Era meant that this could be used to treat someone about to miscarry a pregnancy, not that it can cause miscarriage!" Chen goes on to explain that in fact, it "greatly stabilizes the fetus." Modern Chinese gynecology concurs with Chen and regards this as an herb that is used to prevent miscarriage due to instability of the Kidney yang.

According to some traditional sources, they should not be taken with strong tea.
