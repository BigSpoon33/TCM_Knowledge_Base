## 📖 Overview

Bitter, draining, sinking, and downward-directing, Aurantii Fructus Immaturus (zhi shi) is an important herb for promoting qi flow and unblocking plugs. The Grand Materia Medica notes that "Its functions are summed up in the phrase 'facilitating the movement of qi'."

Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances states that without it, "one cannot treat excess fullness around the navel and abdomen, reduce phlegm clumps, expel tarried water, drive out harbored food stagnation, break up clumping in the chest, or unblock constipation."

Both Essentials from the Golden Cabinet and Emergency Formulas to Keep Up One's Sleeve mention the efficacy of Aurantii Fructus Immaturus (zhi shi) in the treatment of chest painful obstruction and pain around the region of the heart, in some cases even used as a stand-alone herb.
