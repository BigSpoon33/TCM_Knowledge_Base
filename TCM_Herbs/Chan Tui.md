## 📖 Overview

Cicadae Periostracum (chan tui) is sweet, salty, slightly cold, and light in weight so that it ascends. It dissipates and disperses wind-heat in the Lung channel, releases the exterior to disperse heat, vents rashes, stops itching, and treats hoarseness. It can also expel Liver channel wind-heat, cool the Liver, extinguish wind, and treat children's night terrors, tetanus, superficial visual obstruction, and vertigo.
Cicadae Periostracum (chan tui) not only expels exterior wind, but also calms interior wind; it can therefore treat spasms and convulsions. Its ability to vent rashes is also considerable, but if the pathogenic heat has already penetrated deep into the nutritive and blood levels, it must be combined with strong blood-cooling, toxin-relieving herbs. Otherwise the heat will be pushed out improperly, making the rash worse, and injuring the qi and blood.
Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica describes the clinical actions of Cicadae Periostracum (chan tui):
Transformed from the excess qi of wood and earth, it absorbs wind and sips the dew, and therefore it is sweet, cold, and able to disperse wind-heat. Its body is light and floating, thus it brings out pox and rashes. Its nature is that of casting-off, thus it can cast off a cast in the eye, promote labor and the expulsion of the residue of the birth process. Its moulting is like a peel or shell, thus it is good for skin sores and episodic rashes.

Zhang Xi-Chun observed:
Cicadae Periostracum (chan tui) is slightly cool by nature, with a bland taste- not really an acrid, dispersing herb at all! The reason it can induce sweating is that, as a "skin" itself, it can reach the skin. It is actually a marvelous substance in this context, especially appropriate for weak patients who cannot withstand normal exterior-releasing methods.

Chen Shi-Duo, in New Compilation of Materia Medica, explored one important aspect of this substance in the treatment of eye disorders:
Cicadae Periostracum (chan tui) is an absolutely indispensable herb to protect the eyes in children's pox and sores. The question then arises, does Cicadae Periostracum (chan tui) truly have this effect of protecting the eyes and ridding them of superficial visual obstruction? The answer is affirmative, but it must be used knowledgeably.
The effect of Cicadae Periostracum (chan tui) protecting the eyes works only before the pox erupts; it will not protect eyes that are already surrounded by pox sores. Whenever pox sores appear in numbers on the head, it is essential that the eyes be protected. Among the exterior-releasing herbs, first use Cicadae Periostracum (chan tui), the idea being to definitely prevent both eyes from erupting with pox. But if the spots have already appeared in the eyes, it is too late - how can one rescue the situation and make them leave?
Chen's point is that Cicadae Periostracum (chan tui) must be used in the very early stages of pox threatening to cause superficial visual obstruction in the eyes. The substance is still effective however for other types of superficial visual obstruction. He concludes: "For the average superficial visual obstruction, even small doses of Cicadae Periostracum (chan tui) are effective, for obstructions from pox, even large amounts will not work."
