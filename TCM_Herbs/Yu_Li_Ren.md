autumn.

enriching aspects.

Additional product information 
While some sources list this herb as Cannabis Fructus, because 
the exocarp of the nut fruit is fragile and mostly removed during 
the usual processing method of stir frying, the name Cannabis 
Semen is more appropriate to the actual part of the plant that is 
used. Because the exocarp is sometimes contaminated by resin 
containing THC, the use of Fructus Cannabis is restricted by the 
narcotics laws of many countries, while some countries specifi-
cally exempt the use of Cannabis Semen from their laws.

and unblocks the water pathways to promote urination, 
while also directing the qi downward and draining and 
moistening the Large Intestine to treat constipation and 
guide out obstruction. This herb is most often used for
