## 📖 Overview

Best at directing rebellious qi downward, Eriobotryae Folium (枇杷葉 pi pa ye) cools Lung heat to transform phlegm and alleviate cough; it also cools Stomach heat, alleviates nausea, and quenches restless thirst. Thus, by cooling Lung heat and directing Lung qi downward, Eriobotryae Folium (枇杷葉 pi pa ye) can be used for cough, coughing of blood, or nosebleed due to Lung disturbance from wind-warmth, warm-heat, pathogenic summerheat, or dry-heat. It can likewise be used to direct turbid pathogens downward and out of the Stomach in cases of continuous vomiting due to externally-contracted damp-warmth or other contagious toxins.
The Grand Materia Medica describes the main therapeutic action of this herb:
Eriobotryae Folium (枇杷葉 pi pa ye), in treating Lung and Stomach disorders, is generally used for its ability to direct rebellious qi downward. When qi is driven downward, fire will then descend and phlegm is smoothly [eliminated]. Thus, rebelliousness is curbed, nausea is quelled, thirst is quenched, and the cough is alleviated.
