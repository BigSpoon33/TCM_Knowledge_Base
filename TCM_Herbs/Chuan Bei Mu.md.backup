## 📖 Overview

Fritillariae Cirrhosae Bulbus (chuan bei mu) cools and transforms phlegm-heat, stops coughs, and disperses clumps, while also moistening the Lungs. It is most commonly indicated for dry heat in the Lungs with a nonproductive cough. However, it also directs Heart fire downward and thus treats constraint.

The use of Fritillariae Cirrhosae Bulbus (chuan bei mu) for relieving constraint is not well-represented in the modern literature, despite its long history. The late Han dynasty physician Zhang Zhong-Jing prescribed it for two conditions marked by constraint. The Song dynasty work Alternative Statements in Materia Medica specifically notes that "Fritillariae Bulbus (bei mu) can disperse constrained qi in the Heart and chest." In Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica, Huang Gong-Xiu concurs: "Presently it is used with good results in treating those with uneasiness in the Heart, anxiety, and constraint." This ability to relieve constraint and direct Heart fire downward is cited as an explanation for actions attributed to the herb in the earliest materia medica, for example, its efficacy in treating painful urinary dribbling.

Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica provides the following discussion:

Fritillariae [Cirrhosae] Bulbus ([chuan] bei mu) is an herb which opens constraint, directs qi downward, and dissolves phlegm in order to alleviate cough and calm wheezing. It is indicated for clumped fire from deficiency conditions.
Therefore use it with:

- Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mu) to clear the qi and nourish the yin;
- Coptidis Rhizoma (huang lian) and Scutellariae Radix (huang qin) to direct fire and phlegm downward;
- Ginseng Radix (ren shen) and Astragali Radix (huang qi) to tonify without accumulation;
- Angelicae Sinensis Radix (dang gui) and Paeoniae Radix Alba (bai shao) to harmonize the nutritive qi;
- Forsythiae Fructus (lian qiao) to release constrained toxins and treat goiter.

It can also be used as a substitute for Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum (zhi ban xia) in Two-Cured Decoction (er chen tang) to tonify the Lungs, eliminate phlegm, harmonize the middle, and direct fire downward.

For all of the above uses of Fritillariae Bulbus (bei mu), one should use Fritillariae Cirrhosae Bulbus (chuan bei mu) to achieve outstanding results.

Wang Ji, however, warns that substituting Fritillariae Cirrhosae Bulbus (chuan bei mu) for Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum (zhi ban xia) cannot be done indiscriminately.

In Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica, he is quoted as follows:

They say that Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum (zhi ban xia) is acrid and toxic, and one should substitute Fritillariae Cirrhosae Bulbus (chuan bei mu)-do they not know that Fritillariae Cirrhosae Bulbus (chuan bei mu) is cold, moist, and mainly for Lung patients with dry-phlegm, whereas Pinelliae Rhizoma Preparatum (zhi ban xia) is warm, drying, and mainly for Spleen patients with damp-phlegm? How could they be used interchangeably?

Because of the relative expense of Fritillariae Cirrhosae Bulbus (chuan bei mu), it is often administered as a powder to be taken together with the strained decoction of other herbs that alleviate cough. Traditionally, more prescriptions call for its use in powder or pill form than as a decoction.

## ⚡ Functions & Actions

- **Clears heat and transforms phlegm:** for many types of cough, chiefly chronic cough, cough with signs of fire due to yin deficiency, cough with slight sputum that is difficult to expectorate, or cough with blood-streaked sputum. It is most effective in treating cough accompanied by constrained qi, manifested in a reduced appetite and a stifling sensation in the chest and upper abdomen.
    - With Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mu) for cough with minimal or difficult-to-expectorate sputum due to fire from yin deficiency burning the Lungs, as in Fritillaria and Anemarrhena Powder (er mu san).
    - With Armeniacae Semen (xing ren) for cough and wheezing with copious sputum.
    - With Eriobotryae Folium (pi pa ye), Ophiopogonis Radix (mai men dong), and Polygonati odorati Rhizoma (yu zhu) for chronic cough presenting with fatigue, irritability, excessive or bloody sputum, stifling sensation and distention in the chest, and lack of appetite.
    - With Polygalae Radix (yuan zhi), Poria (fu ling), and Trichosanthis Fructus (gua lou) for painful obstruction of the chest with palpitations and insomnia.
- **Clears heat and dissipates nodules:** for disorders in which phlegm-fire collects and produces nodules, sores, swellings, scrofula, and Lung or breast abscess.
    - With Fritillariae Thunbergii Bulbus (zhe bei mu) for scrofula and abscess.
