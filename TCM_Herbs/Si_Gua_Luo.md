2 I Herbs that Clear Heat 
167 
Fresh Chrysanthemi indici Flos (ye ju hua) is indeed often 
used together with its stalk and leaf as a paste externally for 
all kinds of toxic boils and swollen abscesses. The liquid 
from a decoction of the flowers can be similarly applied. 
Comparisons 
»- Vs. CHRYSANTHEMr Fws (ju hua) 
Compared with either the white or yellow varieties of 
Chrysanthemi Flos (ju hua), Chrysanthemi indici Flos (ye 
ju hua) more powerfully drains fire and resolves toxicity, 
and so is often used for toxic swollen sores and boils, com-
bined with other cooling, toxicity-resolving herbs. 
Traditional Contraindications 
"Bitter, cold herbs do not suit those with Stomach prob-
lems. . . . True Chrysanthemi Flos (ju hua) extends life, 
but Chrysanthemi indici Flos (ye ju hua) drains a person. 
Thus, Zhu Dan-Xi said that imbibing Chrysanthemi indici 
Flos (ye ju hua) greatly injures the Stomach qi." (Harm and 
Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
Literal English translation: "wild chrysanthemum" 
The connotation of 'wild' -that is, uncultivated-in this 
herb's name is that it is harsher in its action than the cul-
tivated chrysanthemum. This equates rather well with the 
description of a variety of chrysanthemum described in the 
earliest materia medica, known as bitter job's tears (% :l 
ku yi). Indeed, Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica lists 
that as an alternate name for wild chrysanthemum. 
»- CHARRED WILD CHRYSANTHEMUM 
(Jf *i 1U~. ye ju hua tim) 
The flowers are dry-fried or baked until charred. They 
resolve toxicity and stop bleeding. Treasury of Words on 
the Materia Medica suggests a honey pill made with this 
herb and Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di huang), 
Zingiberis Rhizoma preparatum (pew Jiang), Sanguisorbae 
Radix (di yu), and Schisandrae Fructus (wu wei zi) to treat 
Intestinal wind with bleeding. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of yellow, almost globular, un-
fragmented and stalkless flower buds with an aromatic fra-
grance. The fully-opened flowers are of inferior quality.

other toxic sores. Often used for breast abscess, breast dis-
tention and lumps, as well as insufficient lactation.

Commentary 
Sweet and neutral, Luffae Fructus Retinervus (s! gua luo) 
enters the Lung, Stomach, and Liver channels to resolve 
toxicity, reduce swelling, unblock the collaterals, trans-
form phlegm, dispel wind, and invigorate the blood. The 
reticular network of this herb is suggestive of the network 
of collaterals throughout the body, an observation which 
has guided clinical application of the substance. The fact 
that it is not red, but pale yellowish white, suggests an affin-
ity to the Stomach and the Lungs, and therefore to phlegm 
pathologies. Essentials of the Materia Medica is quite spe-
cific about the former observation: 
Old luffa have sinews and collaterals with a hole straight 
through the middle, resembling human channels and col-
laterals, thus its qi can be borrowed for guiding [purposes] 
.. . cools the blood, resolves toxicity, transforms phlegm, 
unblocks the channels and collaterals, and promotes move-
ment in the blood vessels. 
Many materia medica texts observe that this herb cools 
the blood, but still list its nature as neutral; others state 
that it is slightly cold in nature. However, all agree on its 
ability to spread throughout the collaterals in order to 
transform phlegm and promote the flow of qi and blood. 
The Renewed Materia Medica says that it "Unblocks the 
channels and collaterals, harmonizes the blood vessels, 
transforms phlegm, and smooths the flow of qi." It is often 
used in gynecological treatments for breast distention and 
insufficient lactation due to stagnation of qi and blood. For 
this indication, the charred herb is powdered, and 3-6g are 
taken internally with wine; it can also be pulverized and 
applied externally for cracked nipples. 
In the Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang 
Bing-Cheng cites Li Shi-Zhen's statement that it "Unblocks 
the channels and collaterals, cools the blood, expels wind, 
nature is sweet-cold, transforms phlegm, and resolves tox-
icity." Zhang then comments: 
Luffae Fructus Retinervus (sz gua luo), sweet in flavor, cold 
in nature, enters the channels and collaterals to resolve 
heat pathogens, so that when heat is resolved, the wind 
is expelled. If the yin fluids and yang fluids are unable to 
reach into the coUaterals, swelling and toxicity of all types 
result; this is why it resolves toxicity. 
This slight cooling quality is also a characteristic of the 
whole gourd when eaten as food. Seeking Accuracy in the 
Materia Medica states that it 
is a cold substance by nature: sweet in flavor, slippery in 
texture. Whenever people have wind-phlegm, damp-heat, 
gu toxin ( :i. -t- gu du), or blood accumulation lodged and 
stagnated in the channels and collaterals, this can manifest 
in such disorders as carbuncles or sores, continuous uterine 
bleeding, Intestinal wind, or edema. The consumption of 
luffa will be effective because it unblocks the channels and 
spreads out through the coUaterals, reaching everywhere. 
The ability of the unprepared herb to cool the blood is rath-
er weak, and is suitable for this purpose only as an adjunct 
to stronger blood-cooling herbs.

Both herbs invigorate the collaterals and are sweet and 
harmonious in nature, and both expel wind. However,
