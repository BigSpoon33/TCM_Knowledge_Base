19 I Obsolete Substances 
Calomel is a very heavy, soft, white, sweetish-tasting miner-
al, most often found as a coating formed from the alteration 
of cinnabar or other mercury-based mineral. In its natural 
state it is also called horn quicksilver. 
The word calomel comes from the Greek words kalos 
(beautiful) and melas (black). During the nineteenth century 
it was the most popular cholagogue cathartic in the West, 
in that, when taken internally, it produces frequent, soft 
stools, very highly colored with bile. It became less used 
internally when its potential toxicity (due to disassociation 
into mercury and mercuric chloride) was recognized, and 
other superior cathartics were found. 
In Chinese it is called mercury powder UfZ;f,f gong fin) 
or light powder (*.¥.;f,f qing fin). Other early names were 
precipitous powder (.Ljlj ;f,f qiiw fin) and greasy powder 
(~A\;f,f nl fin). Li Shi-Zhen explained the origins of these 
names: "'Light' speaks of its texture, 'precipitous' speaks of 
its shape, 'greasy' refers to its nature." In the Grand Materia 
Medica, Li himself lists it as water-silver powder (7j(.*if".,f 
shui yin fin), 'water-silver' being the common appellation 
for mercury. 
Calomel must be stored in a dark, cool place to prevent 
disassociation into more toxic mercuric substances. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of lightweight, white, clean, needle-
shaped crystals. 
Major known chemical constituents 
Mercurous chloride (Hg2CI2). Due to its low water solubility, highly 
pure calomel could be regarded as having a relatively low toxicity, 
but exposure to light or heating in solution will cause it to disas-
sociate into metallic mercury and the highly toxic and corrosive 
mercuric chloride (HgCI2).
