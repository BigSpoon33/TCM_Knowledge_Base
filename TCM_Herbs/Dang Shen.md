## 📖 Overview

Sweet and neutral, Codonopsis Radix (dang shen) tonifies both the Spleen and Lung qi with a harmonious and gentle nature that is neither drying nor cloying. Because flourishing qi generates blood and fluids, Codonopsis Radix (dang shen) indirectly contributes to the normal supply of blood and fluids as well. It is therefore appropriate for fatigue, lack of strength, poor appetite, loose stools, shortness of breath, and blood deficiency following illness or hemorrhage. The Thoroughly Revised Materia Medica says that it "tonifies the middle, augments the qi, harmonizes the Spleen and Stomach, and eliminates irritability with thirst and feeble, weak qi of the middle burner." Omissions from the Grand Materia Medica adds that it "treats Lung deficiency and augments the Lung qi."

Tonifies the middle burner and augments the qi: for lack of appetite, fatigue, tired limbs, diarrhea, vomiting, or any chronic illness with Spleen qi deficiency. Also for symptoms of prolapse of the uterus, stomach, or rectum due to collapsed Spleen qi.
    - With Poria (茯苓, fu ling): for Spleen and Stomach deficiency with fatigue, a sensation of fullness in the abdomen, and loose stools, as in Four-Gentleman Decoction (四君子汤, si jun zi tang).
    - With Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (白术, bai zhu): for reduced appetite, loose stools, and vomiting due to Spleen qi deficiency, as in Strengthen the Spleen Pill (健脾丸, jian pi wan).
