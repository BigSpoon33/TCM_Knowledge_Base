## üìñ Overview

Sweet, astringent, slightly cold, and heavy in weight, Fossilia Ossis Mastodi (long gu) enters the Heart, Liver, and Kidney channels. Interestingly, Medicinal Combining notes that it also "treats disorders of the Girdle vessel." Astringency restrains and holds back to secure what is leaking out, while heaviness eliminates trepidation and anchors the floating yang, hence Fossilia Ossis Mastodi (long gu) restrains and secures the primal qi, calms the spirit, and inhibits loss and leakage. One of its special characteristics is its ability to secure the normal qi while not inhibiting the elimination of pathogenic qi. It is also noted for its effects in the treatment of seizures and epilepsy due to Liver qi rebelling upward carrying phlegm.

Fossilia Ossis Mastodi (long gu) is often used when the yin is unable to control the yang, causing palpitations, insomnia with dream-disturbed sleep, palsy of the face, spasms of the limbs, restlessness, and dizziness and vertigo; or for the yang being unable to secure the yin, leading to excessive sweating, nosebleed, vomiting of blood, blood in the stool or urine, loose stools, urinary incontinence, continuous uterine bleeding, or spermatorrhea.

Applied externally, it restrains dampness, stops bleeding, and assists the healing of sores.

The Grand Materia Medica notes that:

Astringency eliminates abandonment [disorders], thus Fossilia Ossis Mastodi (long gu) restrains and holds back the normal qi that has floated upward and outward, stabilizes the Large Intestine and sedates fright; it also governs disorders of the Girdle vessel.

Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica observes:

Although its nature is binding, it also enters the Liver to break up clumping: mobile and fixed abdominal masses and firm clumping are all accumulations of blood in the Liver channel. ... It also governs disorders of the Girdle vessel causing ceaseless vaginal discharge or continuous uterine bleeding, with fullness in the lower abdomen, and a flowing sensation around the waist, as if sitting in water.

The early twentieth-century writer Zhang Xi-Chun stated that "This medicinal only preserves normal qi, it does not inhibit [expulsion of] pathogenic qi." He went on to explain that its

flavor is slightly acrid, and within its conserving and inhibiting is the power to unbind and unblock, which is why the Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica states that [on the one hand] it treats diarrhea and dysentery with blood and pus, while [on the other hand] it also treats fixed abdominal masses and solid clumps.
