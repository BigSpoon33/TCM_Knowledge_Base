## üìñ Overview

Named for its five flavors, these qualities strongly influence the therapeutic scope of Schisandrae Fructus (wu wei zi). As explained in the Grand Materia Medica, "Sourness and saltiness enter the Liver and tonify the Kidneys, acridity and bitterness enter the Heart and tonify the Lungs, and sweetness enters the middle palace and augments the Spleen and Stomach." However, in the Meaning of Materia Medica, Zhang Shan-Lei notes that "even though it has five flavors, it is primarily sour and restraining. Hence it tonifies the yin of the five yin organs, with emphasis on containing the Kidneys and grasping the qi." He goes on to say that the herb "is sour and warm in nature, and this warmth is a harmonious warmth, quite different from drying warmth. It generates fluids, stops thirst, and moistens the Lungs and Stomach while augmenting the Kidney yin-its effects are all at the yin level." Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica instructs: "Utilize its sourness to restrain and inhibit the yang fluids, and to protect and secure the primal qi so that it does not leak out and drain away." Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western adds that "Its sour restraining power can also stabilize the transformation of lower burner qi, treat daybreak diarrhea, nocturnal seminal emissions, and urinary frequency, even if the patient has to urinate after only one or two drinks."

The appearance of this herb in the formula Minor Bluegreen Dragon Decoction (xiao qing long tang) focuses attention on its efficacy in the treatment of cough. The Song dynasty commentator Cheng Wu-Ji provides the classic explanation of its inclusion in this formula: "The Lungs favor restraint; when acutely [ill], consume sourness to restrain [Lung qi dispersal]: the sourness of Paeoniae Radix (shao yao) and Schisandrae Fructus (wu wei zi) restrains rebellious qi and quiets the Lungs." Yet this gives the impression that these herbs alone can achieve this effect. Zhang Shan-Lei warns that Cheng's comments

refer to Lung qi deficiency with fullness [within the Lungs], where sourness should be used to restrain [and prevent further loss of Lung qi]. If an externally-contracted pathogen assaults the Lungs, phlegm clogs, and qi rebels-this is an excess disorder. The restraint of Schisandrae Fructus (wu wei zi) [in this situation] is just like killing someone with poisoned wine.

Zhang goes on to say that, in Minor Bluegreen Dragon Decoction (xiao qing long tang), this herb acts in concert with a number of other herbs that drain, disperse, and dry to treat cough and wheezing due to cold, thin mucus, and it cannot be used as a stand-alone herb to stop coughs. "Such is the marvelous subtlety with which the ancient sages designed formulas. As to using this herb alone [for this condition, this is so crude that] one cannot even speak of it in the same breath!"

In terms of quieting the spirit, Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica notes:

Exhaustion of the essence and qi, fire blazing from yin deficiency, or devastation of the yin or of the yang leads to dispersal of the spirit and loss of the pulse-Schisandrae Fructus (wu wei zi) should be used to treat these.

There is another range of actions, less remarked upon in modern textbooks: nourishing the Liver and brightening the eyes. The Materia Medica of Ri Hua-Zi says that it "brightens the eyes, warms the water organ [Kidneys], and strengthens the sinews and bones." This is confirmed in Essentials of the Materia Medica: "[It] tonifies deficiency and brightens the eyes." Li Shi-Zhen quotes Li Gao as saying that it "generates yang fluids, alleviates thirst, treats diarrhea and dysenteric disorders, and tonifies insufficient primal qi. Restrains depleted and dispersed qi, and dilated pupils."

In Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western, Zhang Xi-Chun explains: "It is most sour, and excels at entering the Liver; the orifice of the Liver is the eyes, thus Schisandrae Fructus (wu wei zi) can restrain dilated pupils."

Contraindicated where an exterior disorder has not been cleared, or there is heat from excess in the interior, or in the early stages of a cough or rash.
Traditional Contraindications
It restrains and inhibits the Lung qi, primarily treating chronic cough due to deficiency consumption .... However, it should not be carelessly used when the cough is acute, for fear that Lung fire will be constrained and the pathogen closed in and fettered. One must wait until the pathogen is dispersed and the fire is cleared-its use will then be effective. (Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances)

"[For] pathogenic wind at the exterior, early stages of pox and rashes, all [types of] retained thin mucus, and Lung patients with heat from excess-it is forbidden." (Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica)
