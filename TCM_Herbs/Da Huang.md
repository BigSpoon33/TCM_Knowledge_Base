  toxicity: "Overdosage can cause a toxic reaction, especially if the fresh herb is used. Symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, abdominal colic, and jaundice. Long term use of this herb may cause severe damage to the large intestine, cirrhosis of the liver, and substantial loss of electrolytes (hypokalemia).
Although not used in medicine, it should be noted that the leaves are toxic because of the high content of oxalic acid, which may cause precipitation of calcium oxalate in the renal tubules, and thus renal failure as a consequence. Allergic reactions have also been reported, usually after large doses (30g), and include flushing, pruritus, papular rashes, asthma, and tachypnea."

## 📖 Overview

Bitter, cold, and with a strong downward-directing action, *Rhei Radix et Rhizoma* (da huang) strongly mobilizes and reaches directly into the lower burner. Entering the yang brightness, it washes away accumulated obstruction due to heat from excess; entering the terminal yin, it clears heat from excess in the blood level, and eliminates blood stasis. In this way it is useful for a wide variety of conditions including constipation due to clumped heat in the Intestines; diarrhea due to collected blockage in the Intestines; jaundice; epistaxis, red eyes, and swollen throat due to ascendant fire and heat compelling the blood upward; heat toxin sores and abscesses. It is also used for amenorrhea due to stasis and stagnation, postpartum obstruction, and injury and hematoma from trauma. Unprepared *Rhei Radix et Rhizoma* (da huang) can also be ground into a powder and used externally to cool heat and remove toxins.

Materia Medica for Decoctions notes:
*Rhei Radix et Rhizoma* (da huang) is a yin-within-yin herb, which drains fullness, pushes out the old to create the new, and expels old filth in order to quiet the five yin organs, exactly like suppressing turmoil and rebellion to bring about great peace, which is why it is called the 'general' (*jiang jun*).

Zhang Shan-Lei elaborates on the actions of this herb:
The twelve characters [from the Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica that say] 'pushes out the old to create the new, regulates the middle to transform food, and quiets the five yin-organs' relate to the application of *Rhei Radix et Rhizoma* (da huang) and should be taken most seriously. This is because unblocking is equivalent to tonification, both in the digestion of the Intestines and Stomach, and in the total circulation of the blood vessels. If there is dormant foulness lodged in stagnation, turbid filth will not be expelled, and then even the newly generated blood will readily accumulate into stasis. Only washing away this old putrefaction will create freshness, so that the middle qi will be harmoniously regulated, food will not be hindered in its transformation, and the five yin organs will rest in peaceful harmony.

Zhang goes on to lament that some materia medica texts characterize its strong effects as "toxic," thereby scaring the average practitioner from using it in the clinic, "when even doctors in Western countries extol it as a marvelous tonic for the Stomach!"

Nonetheless, *Rhei Radix et Rhizoma* (da huang) is a strong purgative, and must be used with care during, for example, menstruation or for deficient patients. Inform the patient that it tends to turn the urine and sweat yellow. It also passes through to the breast milk-which may turn yellow-and can cause diarrhea in an infant. Note also that the herb has a peculiar double action: while a large dose (10g or more) will promote bowel movement, as expected, a small dose may have the opposite effect. If a strong effect is needed, the herb should be added separately later in the process of cooking a decoction because over-cooking will reduce its effect.

What is less known is that this herb can be used with excellent effect to expel phlegm-heat through the Intestines. Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica explains that it is very cold and very bitter, with a direct nature, best at opening the lower body, and is therefore an important herb in the treatment of heat clumped in the middle and lower burners as a result of cold damage, warm pathogen diseases, hot disorders, and damp-heat, leading to constipation and urinary difficulty. It is also good for dampness and heat congealing into phlegm in the middle and lower burners. It expels pathogens to halt their violence, and has a special ability to uproot chaos and restore normality.

## ⚡ Functions & Actions

Drains heat and purges accumulations: for high fever, profuse sweating, thirst, constipation, abdominal distention and pain, delirium, yellow tongue coating, and a full pulse. This presentation is referred to either as Intestinal heat excess or the yang brightness organ-stage of the six stages of disease.
    - With *Natrii Sulfas* (mang xiao), *Magnoliae officinalis* Cortex (hou po), and *Aurantii Fructus immaturus* (zhi shi) for unremitting high fever, delirious speech, and constipation, as in Major Order the Qi Decoction (*da cheng qi tang*) and Cool the Diaphragm Powder (*liang ge san*).
    - When taken in a small dose and combined with such herbs as *Cannabis Semen* (huo ma ren) and *Armeniacae Semen* (xing ren) in pill form, it can be used for moderate constipation, as in Hemp Seed Pills (*ma zi ren wan*).
    - With *Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata* (zhi fu zi) for constipation due to cold accumulation, as in Rhubarb and Aconite Accessory Root Decoction (*da huang fu zi tang*).
    - With *Cinnamomi Cortex* (rou gui) for chronic constipation.
- Drains fire: for fire from excess leading to intense fever, sore throat, hot, swollen, and painful eyes, or fire toxin sores due to heat excess obstructing the blood level. Particularly useful when these problems are accompanied by constipation.
    - With *Coptidis Rhizoma* (huang lian) for a feeling of fullness and distention due to heat accumulation.
    - Add *Scutellariae Radix* (huang qin) for vomiting blood or nosebleed due to chaotic movement of hot blood, as in Coptis Decoction to Resolve Toxicity (*huang lian jie du tang*).
    - With *Gardeniae Fructus* (zhi zi), *Scutellariae Radix* (huang qin), and *Forsythiae Fructus* (lian qiao) for strong pathogenic heat in the upper and middle burners, as in Cool the Diaphragm Powder (*liang ge san*).
    - With *Gentianae Radix* (long dan cao) and *Prunellae Spica* (xia ku cao) for Liver fire leading to headache and anger with constipation.
- Clears heat, transforms dampness, and promotes urination: for damp-heat leading to such problems as edema, jaundice, painful urinary dribbling, as well as acute, hot dysenteric disorders.
    - With *Artemisiae scopariae Herba* (yin chen) and *Gardeniae Fructus* (zhi zi) for jaundice and associated flank pain, as in Artemisia Yinchenhao Decoction (*yin chen hao tang*).
    - With *Kansui Radix* (gan sui) for accumulation of pathogenic heat and fluids in the chest and upper abdomen, as in Major Sinking Into the Chest Decoction (*da xian xiong tang*).

Also for chaotic movement of hot blood that overflows, manifested in vomiting blood or nosebleed accompanied by constipation. Can be powdered and administered orally for bleeding from the upper digestive tract. This is an important herb because it can stop bleeding without causing blood stasis.
    - With *Moutan Cortex* (mu dan pi) and *Persicae Semen* (tao ren) for Intestinal abscess, as in Rhubarb and Moutan Decoction (*da huang mu dan tang*).
- Invigorates the blood and dispels blood stasis: for amenorrhea, fixed abdominal masses, or fixed pain due to blood stasis. Also for blood stasis due to traumatic injury or Intestinal abscess. This is an important herb for treating both recent and long-term blood stasis as it can both eliminate static blood that is outside the vessels via the bowels, and clear the heat that often develops from stasis. It is used both internally and externally.
    - With *Cinnamomi Ramulus* (gui zhi) for blood stasis to simultaneously remove the stasis and unblock the flow of qi.
    - With *Angelicae sinensis Radix* (dang gui), *Persicae Semen* (tao ren), and *Carthami Flos* (hong hua) for blood stasis.
    - With *Hirudo* (shui zhi) and *Tabanus* (meng chong) to purge intense blood stasis.
- Clears heat and reduces fire toxicity: used either topically or internally for burns or skin lesions due to heat.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**
Because this herb readily injures the Stomach qi, it should not be used in those with a weak Stomach. Similarly, it should be avoided by those with qi and blood deficiency who do not have significant accumulations or blood stasis. Use with great caution, and only when absolutely necessary, during menstruation, pregnancy, and lactation. See TOXICITY below.
The classic states that excess should be drained. The nature [of this herb] is greatly bitter, greatly cold, and exceedingly facilitating, its fierce and violent qi drives deep in to pound [the enemy], letting nothing stop its progress. Thus, if blood level heat is not clumped, and the six pulses are not deep and full, definitely do not lightly use it to wash away [constipation]. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)
