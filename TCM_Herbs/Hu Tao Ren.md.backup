## 📖 Overview

Sweet, warm, and moistening, Juglandis Semen (*he tao ren*) enters the Lung and Kidney channels where it has two principal actions: it warms the Kidney yang to strengthen the lower back and knees, and while tonifying the Kidneys it augments the Lungs and promotes the grasping of qi to settle wheezing. These effects, however, are gentle and gradual, and it generally serves as an assistant herb or in food therapy. Because it is rather oily and moist, it can moisten dryness and lubricate the Intestines.

The Detailed Materia Medica explains how it can affect both the Kidneys and the Lungs:

Once the gate of vitality is unblocked, the Triple Burner is naturally facilitated, and thus [the herb's actions] ascend to reach the Lungs and it is suitable for wheezing or cough due to cold from deficiency. It descends to reach the Kidneys, and it is thus appropriate for pain from deficiency in the lower back and legs ... [it] is only appropriate for cold from deficiency, and should not be consumed by those with phlegm-fire or accumulated heat.

The Grand Materia Medica says that walnuts can tonify the qi, nourish the blood, moisten dryness, transform phlegm, augment the gate of vitality, facilitate the Triple Burner, warm the Lungs, and moisten the Intestines. They treat coughs due to cold from deficiency, and heavy pain in the lower back and feet.

Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western says that walnuts are an important herb for enriching and tonifying the Liver and Kidneys, and strengthening the sinews and bones. Hence they excel in the treatment of pain in the lower back and legs, and all types of pain in the sinews and bones. Because they tonify the Kidneys, they can stabilize the teeth, blacken the hair, and treat disorders such as coughs or wheezing due to deficiency consumption, the failure of qi to return to its base, lower burner cold from deficiency, urinary frequency, and uterine bleeding and vaginal discharge in women.

Essentials of the Materia Medica includes an interesting anecdote:

(Hong recorded:) My youngest son was ill with phlegmy wheezing. I had a dream of [the goddess] Guanyin, who directed me to administer Ginseng and Walnut Decoction (*ren shen hu tao tang*); he took it and was better. The next day [in preparing the decoction] I removed the pericarp from the walnut-the wheezing returned. When the pericarp was used, within several nights the illness was cured. Probably the pericarp can preserve the Lungs.
