blood. It tends to focus on the Heart channel. By contrast, 
Paeoniae Radix rubra ( chl shdo) cannot clear the heat of yin 
deficiency from the blood, just the heat of excess, but its 
blood-invigorating action is stronger than that of Moutan 
Cortex (mu diin pi), and it also stops pain. Its focus is more 
on the Liver channel.

Traditional Contraindications 
With its turbid aroma, it very easily brings on nausea; those 
with weak stomachs will vomit as soon as they take it. It 
also invigorates the blood and unblocks stagnation. Thus, it 
is contraindicated for those with cold from deficiency of the 
Stomach, women with heavy bleeding or extended menses, 
and those who are pregnant. It cannot be used for hemor-
rhages due to blood heat if there is no concurrent blood 
stagnation. (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
Occasionally, such side effects as nausea and dizziness may 
appear. These usually disappear spontaneously without 
discontinuing use of the herb. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
:» DRY-FRIED MOUTAN (:k;!l4±ft !§_chao mu dan pi) 
The herb is added to a heated pan, then continuously 
turned until slightly scorched with yellowish brown spots. 
This reduces its cold property and ability to disperse, but 
improves its capacity to drain fire within yin. Thus, it is 
most often used for Liver and Kidney yin deficiency lead-
ing to low-grade fever with steaming bone disorder without 
sweating. 
:» WINE-FRIED MOUT AN {)@ -):y 4± ft !§_ jiu chao mu diin pi) 
Mixed with rice wine, then fried, this enhances its abil-
ity to disperse and transform blood stasis. It is thus most 
appropriate for abdominal masses, accumulations, and 
amenorrhea. 
:» CHARRED MOUTAN (4±ft !§__& mu diin pi tiln) 
The herb is dry-fried or baked at high heat until blackened, 
but not completely carbonized, then sprinkled with water 
so that it rapidly cools. Its blackness enhances its ability to 
enter the blood, where it cools and stops bleeding, but does 
so without causing further stasis. This special characteristic 
makes this a popular form of preparation, and it is widely 
used for any bleeding due to pathogenic heat disturbing 
the blood. 
Quality Criteria 
Good quality consists of thick, white, and starchy quills 
with the xylem removed and a strong aroma.

Phenols and phenol glycosides: paeonol, paeonolide, paeonoside, 
apiopaeonoside, paeoniflorin, oxypaeoniflorin, benzoylpaeoniflorin, 
benzoyloxypaeoniflorin, galloyloxypaeoniflorin, galloylpaeoniflorin,

Adulterants 
Paeonia veitchii ( Jil 1f; {) chuan chi shao): The heartwood of this 
species is difficult to separate from the bark, so the inner surface 
is rough, in contrast to Moutan Cortex (mu dan pf), where it is 
smooth.

Actions & Indications 
• Clears heat, cools the blood, and resolves fire toxicity while 
venting rashes: for encouraging rashes to surface, or, if the 
course of the disease (such as measles or chickenpox) is not 
progressing well, for encouraging the complete expression 
of the rash. Often used for fire toxin with very dark purple 
rashes. In addition, as this herb also moistens the Intestines 
and promotes urination, it is commonly used when rashes 
are accompanied by constipation or urinary dysfunction. 
-
With Forsythiae Fructus (lian qiiw), Cicadae Periostra-
cum (chan tul), and Paeoniae Radix rubra (chl shao) for 
dark purple measles with incomplete expression of the rash. 
.. . Add Arctii Fructus (niu bang zi) and Sophorae 
tonkinensis Radix (shan dou gen) if accompanied by severe 
sore throat. 
- With Bubali Cornu (shui niu jiao), Rehmanniae Radix 
(sheng dl huang), and Lonicerae Flos (jln yin hua) for 
heat toxin, delirious speech, and deep purple rashes, as in 
Magical Rhinoceros Special Pill (shen xl dan). 
-
With Isatidis Folium (da qlngye) for the dense purpuric 
rash associated with severe fire toxin. 
- With Trichosanthis Semen (gua lou ren) for carbuncles 
due to severe interior fire toxin and associated constipa-
tion. 
-
With Rehmanniae Radix (sheng dl huang), Cirsii Herba 
(xiao jl), and Imperatae Rhizoma (bai mao gen) for blood 
in the urine or nosebleed due to heat in the blood. 
- With Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cao) as a preventative for 
measles. 
• Clears damp-heat from the skin: applied topically for 
damp-heat skin lesions or vaginal itching. Also used for 
burns. 
-
With Phellodendri Cortex (huang bdi) for disorders of 
heat in the skin such as boils, eczema, and burns. 
-
With Angelicae dahuricae Radix (bai zhi) and Angelicae 
sinensis Radix (dang gul) as an ointment for burns or 
sores. 
Commentary 
Cooling and moistening, because of its salty flavor it enters 
the blood, and due to its sweet and cold properties it clears 
heat. Arnebiae Radix/Lithospermi Radix (zi cao) is best for 
cooling the blood, invigorating the blood, resolving toxic-
ity, and venting rashes, while also promoting urination and 
unblocking the Intestines. 
The Grand Materia Medica notes that 
It is most effective for cooling the blood, moving the blood, 
and facilitating the Large and Small Intestines. Therefore, 
it should be used for pox and rashes which are about to 
express, but fail to express completely, with blood heat, 
excessive toxicity, and obstructed, difficult bowel move-
ments. 
This passage goes on to say that, not only is this herb effec-
tive for bright rashes which are obviously due to blood 
heat, but also when pox and rashes are very dark purple 
due to excessive fire toxin, as long as there is concurrent 
constipation. 
Comparisons 
y Vs. ARCTII FRucTus (niu bang zi) 
Both herbs resolve toxicity, vent rashes, moisten the bow-
els, and unblock the Intestines, and indeed are often com-
bined for the treatment of constrained heat toxin prevent-
ing the complete expression of rashes, in conjunction with 
constipation. 
However, Arnebiae/Lithospermi Radix (zi cao) is pur-
ple in color, slippery in nature, and sweet, salty, and cold. 
It is best for clearing and regulating blood heat, with a 
moderate ability to eliminate damp-heat through the stools 
and urine. Arctii Fructus ( niu bang zi) is heavy and also 
slippery in nature, as well as acrid, bitter, and slightly cold. 
It mobilizes the qi level and releases the exterior, disperses 
wind-heat, benefits the throat, and disperses clumps. At the 
same time, it can drain the interior, direct qi downward, 
and resolve heat toxin internally. 
Therefore, while Arnebiae/Lithospermi Radix (zi cao) 
treats unexpressed rashes due to heat toxin constrained in 
the blood, Arctii Fructus ( niu bang zi) treats rashes from 
wind-heat confined in the exterior. And while Arnebiae/ 
Lithospermi Radix (zi cao) cools the blood, Arctii Fructus 
(niu bang zi) expels wind-heat.
