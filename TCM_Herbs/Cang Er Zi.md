## 📖 Overview

Warm, harmonious, and able to both dredge up and thrust out, the bitterness of Xanthii Fructus (苍耳子 cāng ěr zi) dries dampness, but its sweet flavor moderates this action so that it is not extreme. Its spreading, dispersing, disseminating, and unblocking actions reach up to the vertex, down to the knees and feet, and outward to the skin. Thus, Xanthii Fructus (苍耳子 cāng ěr zi) is used for wind-cold headache, sinus obstruction syndrome and nasal discharge, painful obstruction, cramping spasms, rashes, and itching. Its specialty is its ability to reach, disperse, and disseminate throughout the upper and lower, internal and external parts of the body, without being especially drying.

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica elaborates:

Xanthii Fructus (苍耳子 cāng ěr zi) is warm; dredging up and thrusting out, [it] frees the movement of the joints, and by disseminating the qi it unblocks the channels and collaterals. It extends over all the orifices and skin, yet is not violently drying. For these reasons, it is the strongest, yet most docile, herb for treating painful obstruction caused by wind, cold, and dampness. Only this, too, can reach upward to the vertex of the head, dredging and unblocking wind-cold from within the brain: it is an essential herb for wind disorders of the head. And yet it has none of the usual acrid, aromatic tendencies for rapid mobilization, or excessive raising or draining, so that there are no concerns for the normal qi.
