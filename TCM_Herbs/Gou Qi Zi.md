## 📖 Overview

*Lycii Fructus* (gou qi zi) nourishes the blood in the Liver to brighten the eyes, and tonifies the Lung and Kidney yin, while also mildly augmenting the Kidney yang. The Grand Materia Medica states that it "enriches the Kidneys, moistens the Lungs, and brightens the eyes." It goes on to note that "the fruit is sweet, neutral, and moistening; with a nature that enriches and tonifies: it cannot eliminate heat (xie), [as the root-bark of this plant, *Lycii Cortex* (di gu pi) can]; it only tonifies the Kidneys and moistens the Lungs, generates essence and augments the qi."

In Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western, Zhang Xi-Chun takes issue with the ability of this herb to cool heat, stating that the fruit "definitely has the effect of reducing heat, and this is not empty talk: I have personally examined this carefully." He then describes how, at fifty years of age, he would feel hot when waking from sleep, and over the course of a night would drink a full pitcher of water. If he chewed 30g of this herb before sleeping, the water intake was reduced by half, and he would awaken without heat. He rhetorically asks whether this is heat from deficiency, or from excess, then proceeds to explain that, as he is rather fat, there is no lack of yin. This is clearly not heat from deficiency [in the normal sense]. Likewise, there is no heat sensation during the day, nor at night when not asleep; it is only when just waking from sleep that heat emerges from the area of the Heart. This heat is generated during sleep, and is clearly not the same as the flushing of heat from excess. It comes about because, during sleep, the Heart and the Kidneys naturally connect and generate heat, a manifestation of the flourishing of vigorous congenital primal yang. Because only *Lycii Fructus* (gou qi zi) can tonify and enrich the primal yin so that it mutually aids the congenital primal yang, it has this effect.
