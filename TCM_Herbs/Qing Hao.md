## 📖 Overview

Bitter, cold, and aromatic, Artemisiae Annuae Herba (*qīng hāo*) enters the Liver and Gallbladder channels. While its bitterness and coldness clear heat, its aroma vents and disperses; it is thus ideal for clearing Liver and Gallbladder heat, and cooling heat in the blood. It vents heat in the yin level outward, bringing the pathogen from the yin level out to the yang level.
- This herb is often used for summerheat with low fever, headache, dizziness, and a stifling sensation in the chest, fevers due to yin or blood deficiency, especially those that worsen at night, and malarial disorders with alternating chills and fevers. It can also cool the blood to treat purpuric rashes and stop bleeding such as nosebleeds.
- Furthermore, its aroma is mild in effect, and its bitter coldness does not harm the Stomach nor injure the yin and blood; it is therefore particularly appropriate for heat disorders in patients with blood deficiency.
- The New Compilation of Materia Medica notes that Artemisiae Annuae Herba specifically resolves steaming bones and consumptive heat, and is outstanding for draining the fire of summerheat - but in so draining it does not exhaust the qi or blood. Thus, it is particularly indicated for yin deficient patients who have externally contracted pathogens.
- Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica elaborates:
    - "Its clear aroma seeps through the forehead, and therefore brightens the eyes and also disperses wind-heat - it does not only work through its bitter-coldness, clearing and directing downward! Its sprout appears very early [in the spring] so that it receives the qi of spring that commands raising and bringing forth, and thus it enters both the Liver and the Gallbladder channels to clear heat from the blood. The reason that it can treat heat remaining within the bones and joints is that it enters deeply into the blood and dredges constrained fire outward. Its present use for resolving summerheat during the hottest days of the season relies on its bitter coldness to clear heat, as well as its beautifully aromatic and chilling qi, which enables it to awaken the Spleen and Stomach, and regulate damp-heat."
    - When Encountering observes that the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica, it can facilitate the water pathways in a manner that is not dissimilar to Artemisiae Scopariae Herba (Yīn Chén), is correct.
