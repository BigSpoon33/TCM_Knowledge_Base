## 📖 Overview

*Cinnamomi Cortex* (ròu guì) is sweet, acrid, and very warm. Its sweetness tonifies, its acridity disperses, and its warmth strongly unblocks cold obstruction. It enters the Heart, Spleen, Liver, and Kidney channels, and the relationships among these Organs and channels define its scope of activity.

It warms the Heart yang, disperses chest painful obstruction due to cold, promotes the movement of blood within the vessels; the use of this herb should always be considered when the pulse is slow. When used for Heart disorders, Cinnamon heart (肉桂心 ròu guì xīn) is the preferred form of this herb. *Cinnamomi Cortex* (ròu guì) warms the Spleen when the Spleen yang is deficient, causing loss of appetite and loose stools with undigested food; if it is due to Kidney yang deficiency, it is even more appropriate. This herb enters the blood aspect of the Liver, dispersing blood stasis, unblocking menstruation in cases of amenorrhea, alleviating menstrual pain due to cold, and breaking up mobile and fixed abdominal masses.

This herb enters and tonifies the Kidney yang and fire at the gate of vitality, and thereby treats such symptoms as cold weakness of the lower back, chilled extremities, and nocturia. If the influence of yin is excessive in the lower burner, the weak yang can be forced outward, producing manifestations of false heat. In this case, the acrid warmth of *Cinnamomi Cortex* (ròu guì) can disperse the congealed yin influence, and allow the yang to return to its root in the gate of vitality. One view, however, is that it is not as suitable in cases of yang floating outward due to weakness of the yang itself (see Comparisons below).

The association of the Liver and the Kidneys at the level of the sinews and bones means that this herb will also be effective in the treatment of painful obstruction conditions due to cold and dampness, treating joint pain all over the body. This use was mentioned as early as the *Divine Pivot*, which recommends that *Cinnamomi Cortex* (ròu guì), *Zanthoxyli Pericarpium* (花椒 huā jiāo), and *Zingiberis Rhizoma* (干姜 gān jiāng) be soaked in wine, then bandages be soaked in the same wine and wrapped around areas of pain, with heat applied to the bandages.

In *Convenient Reader of Materia Medica*, Zhang Bing Cheng observed that it is acrid, sweet, and very warming, tonifies the gate of vitality, reinforces fire, and reduces yin. Purple, crimson, and very aromatic, it augments the Liver and Kidneys, unblocks the channels, and promotes the movement of blood. For conditions such as lower backache and bulging disorders, it guides and it warms; for pathogens such as wind-cold and painful obstruction due to dampness, it disseminates and disperses.

Its sweetness carries some acridity, and naturally has a measure of aromatic piercing warmth. It enters the blood level of the four channels Heart, Liver, Spleen, and Kidneys, where its warmth disperses pathogenic cold at the blood level, breaks up blood clumping, and expels mobile and fixed abdominal masses. Together with herbs that tonify the Kidneys, it tonifies insufficiency of the primal yang at the gate of vitality in disorders such as weak yang forced outward or upward by overabundant yin [see, however, Comparisons below]; it can also guide fire back to its origin. If one wishes to tonify the Heart yang or augment the Spleen yang, it can be combined with the appropriate assistant or envoy herbs.

In *Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western*, Zhang Xi-Chun explains the basis for its therapeutic qualities:

Because it is the bark from the lower part of the tree, its nature reaches downward to warm the cinnabar field, fortify the primal yang, and tonify the ministerial fire. Its color is purple-crimson, so it is excellent for tonifying the sovereign fire and warmly unblocking the blood vessels. It treats blood vessels painfully obstructed by cold all around the body, and thus treats pain in the joints, lower back, and limbs.

Also for waning of the Spleen and Kidney yang with abdominal pain and cold, reduced appetite, and diarrhea. It is also important for wheezing due to the failure of the Kidneys to grasp the qi. In addition, an important herb for warming the Heart yang, particularly when deficiency of Heart yang is the etiology of chest painful obstruction.

    *   With *Aconiti Radix Lateralis Preparata* (制附子 zhì fù zǐ) for Kidney yang insufficiency and waning of the fire at the gate of vitality, as in Kidney Qi Pill from the Golden Cabinet (金匮肾气丸 jīn guì shèn qì wán).
    *   With *Alpiniae Officinarum Rhizoma* (高良姜 gāo liáng jiāng), *Zingiberis Rhizoma Preparatum* (炮姜 pào jiāng), and *Piperis Longi Fructus* (荜茇 bì bá) for cold and pain in the abdomen, loss of appetite, and diarrhea due to yang deficiency of the Spleen and Kidneys.
    *   With *Ginseng Radix* (人参 rén shēn) and *Rehmanniae Radix Preparata* (熟地黄 shú dì huáng) for palpitations and shortness of breath due to deficiency of the Heart and Kidneys.
*   **Disperses deep cold, warms the channels, unblocks the channels and vessels, and alleviates pain:** for deep cold causing qi stagnation or blood stasis. Associated problems include cold in the blood causing amenorrhea or dysmenorrhea, cold-damp painful obstruction, yin-type boils (chronic sores that are usually concave and ooze a clear fluid), and sores or abscesses that do not heal. It enters the blood aspect and is often used in small amounts to enhance the blood-moving action of other substances.

    *   With *Rehmanniae Radix Preparata* (熟地黄 shú dì huáng) and *Ephedrae Herba* (麻黄 má huáng) for yin-type localized, flat abscesses that blend into the surrounding tissue, as in Yang-Heartening Decoction (阳和汤 yáng hé tāng).
    *   With *Astragali Radix* (黄芪 huáng qí) and *Angelicae Sinensis Radix* (当归 dāng guī) for yin-type boils due to qi and blood deficiency, particularly those that form but do not ulcerate.
    *   With *Angelicae Sinensis Radix* (当归 dāng guī) and *Chuanxiong Rhizoma* (川芎 chuān xiōng) for dysmenorrhea or amenorrhea due to cold from deficiency of the Penetrating and Conception vessels.

*   **Leads the fire back to its source:** the principal herb for treating the upward-floating of deficient yang. Manifestations include flushed face, wheezing, severe sweating (when the sweat pours out like oil), weak and cold lower extremities, and a deficient and rootless pulse. This pattern is called false heat and true cold, or heat above/cold below. Also used for other conditions where the upper part of the body is hot (e.g., dry mouth, sore throat, or toothache that worsen at night) and the lower part is cold (e.g., lower back pain, cold lower extremities, diarrhea, weakness in the proximal position of the pulse).

    *   With *Phellodendri Cortex* (黄柏 huáng bǎi) and *Anemarrhenae Rhizoma* (知母 zhī mǔ) for urinary discomfort and urinary retention due to Kidney deficiency.
    *   With *Coptidis Rhizoma* (黄连 huáng lián) for irritability, restlessness, coolness of the lower limbs, and difficulty falling asleep due to disharmony between the Heart and Kidneys, as in Grand Communication Pill (交泰丸 jiāo tài wán).
