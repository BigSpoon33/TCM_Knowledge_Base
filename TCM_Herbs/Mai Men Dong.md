## üìñ Overview

Sweet, cold, and moistening, Ophiopogonis Radix (mai men dong) nourishes the yin, generates fluids, and moistens dryness in the upper and middle burners. Its slight bitter cold properties clear heat, and thus it cools and nourishes the yin of the Lungs, Heart, and Stomach. It also clears heat from the Heart and eliminates irritability. Because it is harmonious and not very cloying, it is an excellent choice for treating Stomach yin deficiency.

If the variety known as center-retained ophiopogon (see NOMENCLATURE & PREPARATION below) is used, it unblocks the channels and collaterals and restores the fluids within the vessels. Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica states that it is an herb for clearing the Heart and moistening the Lungs. It governs Heart qi insufficiency with palpitations, both mild and severe, forgetfulness, disorientation, loss of control of the consciousness, or Lung heat and Lung dryness... or dryness of the Spleen and Stomach with constipation from [fluid] deficiency and difficulty passing stool.

One Hundred Annotations to the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica says that it is purely a Stomach yin-tonifying herb. Later generations incorrectly viewed it as a Lung herb, but earth generates metal, and the Lung qi completely depends on the Stomach yin for its generation. If the Stomach qi is moist, the Lungs will naturally accrue the benefit.

The multiple, laterally-growing and linked tubers are a source of comment in a number of materia medica texts as they suggest the linked movement outward from the middle burner toward the limbs. In Combined Annotations of Three Experts on the Classic of Materia Medica, Ye Tian Shi says: "[The tubers of] Ophiopogonis Radix (mai men dong) grow horizontally, hence they unblock the Stomach qi to the four extremities, reaching upward to the Heart and downward to the abdomen."

## ‚ö° Functions & Actions

-   **Moistens the Lungs and nourishes the yin:** Used whenever the Lung yin has been injured with such signs as either a hacking, dry cough or a cough with thick sputum that is difficult to expectorate, or coughing up blood. Most suitable when the cause is pathogenic warm-dryness or dryness that has transformed into fire, as the herb also has some ability to cool the Lungs.
    -   With Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao), Mori Folium (sang ye), and Eriobotryae Folium (pi pa ye) for warm-dryness injuring the Lungs with fever, cough, wheezing, and fullness and pain in the chest and lower rib areas, as in Eliminate Dryness and Rescue the Lungs Decoction (qing fei jiu fei tang).
    -   With Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mu) and Trichosanthis Fructus (gua lou) for pathogenic dryness that has transformed to fire with coughing of thick, viscous, yellow sputum with chest pain and even coughing up blood.
        -   Add Ecliptae Herba (mo han lian) and Imperatae Rhizoma (bai mao gen) for significant coughing up of blood.
    -   With Asparagi Radix (tian men dong) for Lung and Kidney yin deficiency marked by consumptive cough with occasional coughing up of blood. Often these problems worsen with activity and are marked by dry, lusterless skin.
    -   With Scrophulariae Radix (xuan shen), Platycodi Radix (jie geng), and Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cao) as a tea for an itchy and dry throat, thirst, and nonproductive cough due to insufficient Lung yin.
    -   With Scrophulariae Radix (xuan shen) and Moutan Cortex (mu dan pi) for those with yin-deficient constitutions who develop a swollen, painful diptherial disorder after contracting an epidemic toxin, as in Nourish the Yin and Clear the Lungs Decoction (yang yin qing fei tang).
-   **Augments the Stomach yin and generates fluids:** For dry tongue and mouth due to insufficient Stomach yin.
    -   With Glehniae/Adenophorae Radix (sha shen) and Polygonati odorati Rhizoma (yu zhu) for insufficient Stomach yin, as in Benefit the Stomach Decoction (yi wei tang).
    -   With Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhi ban xia) and Codonopsis Radix (dang shen) for Stomach yin deficiency with the addition of nausea and vomiting due to rebellious qi.

    -   With Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) and Scrophulariae Radix (xuan shen) for constipation in the aftermath of a febrile disease, as in Increase the Fluids Decoction (zeng ye tang).
-   **Clears the Heart and eliminates irritability:** For irritability due to yin deficiency or a warm-heat pathogen disease at the nutritive level. In both cases, the fever and irritability worsen at night.
    -   With Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) and Scrophulariae Radix (xuan shen) for thirst, constipation, irritability, and low-grade fever due to severely injured fluids, as in the later stages of a warm pathogen disease, as in Clear the Nutritive Level Decoction (qing ying tang).
    -   With Ziziphi spinosae Semen (suan zao ren) and Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang) for irritability and insomnia due to yin deficiency, as in Emperor of Heaven's Special Pill to Tonify the Heart (tian wang bu xin dan).
    -   With Astragali Radix (huang qi), Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui), and Schisandrae Fructus (wu wei zi) for irritability due to severe loss of fluids from sweating.
    -   With Ginseng Radix (ren shen) and Schisandrae Fructus (wu wei zi) for profuse sweating, wheezing, increased heart rate, and exhaustion associated with severe deficiency of the Heart and Lungs.
