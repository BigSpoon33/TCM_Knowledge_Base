## 📖 Overview

Sweet, cold, and moistening, Ophiopogonis Radix (mai men dong) nourishes the yin, generates fluids, and moistens dryness in the upper and middle burners. Its slight bitter cold properties clear heat, and thus it cools and nourishes the yin of the Lungs, Heart, and Stomach. It also clears heat from the Heart and eliminates irritability. Because it is harmonious and not very cloying, it is an excellent choice for treating Stomach yin deficiency.

If the variety known as center-retained ophiopogon (see NOMENCLATURE & PREPARATION below) is used, it unblocks the channels and collaterals and restores the fluids within the vessels. Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica states that it is an herb for clearing the Heart and moistening the Lungs. It governs Heart qi insufficiency with palpitations, both mild and severe, forgetfulness, disorientation, loss of control of the consciousness, or Lung heat and Lung dryness... or dryness of the Spleen and Stomach with constipation from [fluid] deficiency and difficulty passing stool.

One Hundred Annotations to the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica says that it is purely a Stomach yin-tonifying herb. Later generations incorrectly viewed it as a Lung herb, but earth generates metal, and the Lung qi completely depends on the Stomach yin for its generation. If the Stomach qi is moist, the Lungs will naturally accrue the benefit.

The multiple, laterally-growing and linked tubers are a source of comment in a number of materia medica texts as they suggest the linked movement outward from the middle burner toward the limbs. In Combined Annotations of Three Experts on the Classic of Materia Medica, Ye Tian Shi says: "[The tubers of] Ophiopogonis Radix (mai men dong) grow horizontally, hence they unblock the Stomach qi to the four extremities, reaching upward to the Heart and downward to the abdomen."

## ⚡ Functions & Actions

-   **Moistens the Lungs and nourishes the yin:** Used whenever the Lung yin has been injured with such signs as either a hacking, dry cough or a cough with thick sputum that is difficult to expectorate, or coughing up blood. Most suitable when the cause is pathogenic warm-dryness or dryness that has transformed into fire, as the herb also has some ability to cool the Lungs.
    -   With Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao), Mori Folium (sang ye), and Eriobotryae Folium (pi pa ye) for warm-dryness injuring the Lungs with fever, cough, wheezing, and fullness and pain in the chest and lower rib areas, as in Eliminate Dryness and Rescue the Lungs Decoction (qing fei jiu fei tang).
