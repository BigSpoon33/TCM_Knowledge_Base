## 📖 Overview

Pure yang, acrid, hot, drying, and dispersing, Zanthoxyli Pericarpium (hua jiao) is best at dispersing cold, drying dampness, and killing parasites. Thus it treats symptoms such as cold pain in the epigastrium and abdomen, indigestion, vomiting, diarrhea, and dysenteric disorders, all of which are due to cold-dampness injuring the middle burner, or abdominal pain due to parasitic infestation. It also treats wind-damp painful obstruction, and because it dispels pathogenic cold in the Lungs, and tonifies the fire at the gate of vitality, it alleviates Lung cold cough, wheezing, and urinary frequency due to weak Kidney yang.

It is applied as a wash in the treatment of irritating vaginal discharge and itch; or, as recommended in Important Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces, as a compress for sore swollen testicles due to cold qi entering the scrotum. For this purpose, it is held in the perineal area and changed daily until the swelling subsides.

The Grand Materia Medica states that it disperses cold, dispels dampness, releases constrained clumping, digests retained food stagnation, unblocks the three burners, warms the Spleen and Stomach, tonifies the right Kidney's gate of vitality, kills roundworms, stops diarrhea.

Records of Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica explains its qualities in detail:

[It] is a qi level herb of the leg greater yin and right Kidney. It expels cold-dampness in the Spleen and Kidneys, but does not expel wind-cold or wind-dampness. If there is only cold without dampness, it is likewise not exactly appropriate. It treats cold-dampness in both the Spleen and Kidneys, but only tonifies fire in the Kidneys. Why is this? Its nature is warm and it travels downward, sufficient to expel cold-dampness, but not enough to expel wind. Its skin is red, its inner membrane white, with a layer of yellow in between, and the innermost seed is black. This gives the image of [travelling] from the Lung through the Spleen to the Kidneys, and thus it can make fire that has drifted out from the midst of water return at last to the midst of water again .... By nature its chief action should be warming the Kidneys. Thus, while other substances warm Spleen cold and expel Spleen dampness, their effect is limited to the Spleen: Zanthoxyli Pericarpium (hua jiao) returns to reside in the Kidneys; its duty is not only in the Spleen.
