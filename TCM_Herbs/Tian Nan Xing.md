## 📖 Overview

Arisaematis Rhizoma preparatum (zhi tian nan xing) is toxic, bitter, intensely acrid, and warm. Its major properties are opening, draining, penetrating, and drying. Entering the Spleen channel, its actions are similar to those of Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhi ban xia) in drying dampness and transforming cold-phlegm, but Arisaematis Rhizoma preparatum (zhi tian nan xing) also enters the Liver channel, and its special quality enables it to move within the channels and collaterals. Thus, it is particularly good at eliminating wind-phlegm. Its major indications are wind stroke with phlegm welling up, or wind-phlegm leading to numbness of the limbs, vertigo, seizures, convulsions, and facial paralysis. It can also disperse clumps and reduce swelling, and so is often used for toxic boils and swellings, phlegm nodes, and even hematoma from trauma.
New Compilation of Materia Medica elaborates:
Other dispersing herbs do not have the harsh power of Arisaematis Rhizoma preparatum (zhi tian nan xing). When the jaw is clenched in wind-stroke it must be used because it breaks open the 'gate' and goes directly in. In other illnesses which do not have the jaw clenched tightly, what need is there to use [it]?
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations
- WITH SAPOSHNIKOVIAE RADIX (fang feng)
Like Arisaematis Rhizoma preparatum (zhi tian nan xing), Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng) expels wind and alleviates convulsions, but its actions are weaker. Both actions are strengthened when the two herbs are combined. Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng) also reduces the toxicity of Arisaematis Rhizoma preparatum (zhi tian nan xing), and for this reason, it is sometimes used in the process of preparing that herb. Clinically, the pair can be used in the treatment of muscular tetany. Equal amounts of each herb can be taken internally as a powder, and also applied externally to the original wound.
