## 📖 Overview

Sinapis Semen (bai jie zi) is intensely acrid and warm, with the distinctive ability to penetrate the yin and restore movement to the yang. Zhu Dan-Xi noted that "Phlegm in the subcostal region, and between the skin and the membranes, cannot be reached without using [it]." It enters the channels with the Lung qi and disperses clumps of cold-phlegm, causing pain in the joints, or yin flat abscesses, and can also reach the interior of the body to relieve pain in the epigastric and abdominal regions. The typical recommended dose is 3-9g, but doses of 15g are often more effective, with few deleterious effects. However, the higher dosage is best used for strong patients, as the strong qi-moving warmth of Sinapis Semen (bai jie zi) may injure the qi in a weak person. Still, this drawback may be less of a problem than one might think, judging from the experience recorded in various materia medica texts.

For example, Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica observes that "Because its flavor is strong but its aroma is light, while it has a rapid opening and guiding action, it does not overly exhaust the qi." A contrary view is expressed in the Convenient Reader of Materia Medica: "Yet it exhausts the yin and disperses qi, blurs the vision, and injures the spirit: it is forbidden for deficient patients."

Chen Shi-Duo was especially enthusiastic regarding the virtues of Sinapis Semen (bai jie zi):

In fact, it is more effective than Pinelliae Rhizoma preparata (zhi ban xia) or Arisaematis Rhizoma preparatum (zhi tian nan xing), as Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhi ban xia) is drying [in nature] and dries the yin, while the heavy flavor of Arisaematis Rhizoma preparatum (zhi tian nan xing) injures the Stomach. Only Sinapis Semen (bai jie zi) dissolves phlegm and sputum, and without exhausting or damaging the Lungs and Stomach. It is most appropriate for entering the qi level, but can also be used at the blood level.

Regarding its phlegm-dissolving properties, Chen continued:

You can verify this by considering malarial disorder phlegm, in which phlegm is hidden in the midst of the diaphragmatic membrane. When you use one liang [30g] of Sinapis Semen (bai jie zi), fried, powdered, and formed into pills with rice, the full amount taken in the space of one day, then even long-term malarial disorder suddenly stops-is this not clear proof of its ability to dissolve phlegm? The disorder ceases, yet the spirit is not lethargic-is this not clear proof that it does not exhaust the qi? Thus, the phlegm-dissolving capacity of Sinapis Semen (bai jie zi) truly surpasses that of Fritillariae Bulbus (bei mu), Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum (zhi ban xia) ....
