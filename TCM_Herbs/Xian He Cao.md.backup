## 📖 Overview

Bitter, astringent, and neutral, Agrimoniae Herba (xian he cao) enters the blood aspect of the Lung, Liver, and Spleen channels. It is commonly used to bind up and inhibit bleeding. As its nature is neither hot nor cold, its use is not restricted to disorders due to either heat or cold, deficiency or excess; it can be used for all types of bleeding. Mirror of the Hundred Herbs states it is used for "external injuries, vomiting of blood, continuous uterine bleeding, dysenteric disorders, and Intestinal wind with passage of blood." It can be used by itself or combined with other herbs to stop bleeding due to various causes.

There are a number of other uses for this herb mentioned in the various materia medica texts, including checking malarial disorders, resolving toxicity, reducing abscesses, and killing parasites. For example, the Grand Materia Medica records that it reduces food stagnation, eases fullness in the middle, drives qi downward, treats all disorders involving vomiting of blood, upset Stomach, belching, malarial disorders, painful obstruction of the throat, Intestinal wind with blood in the stool, accumulated food stasis, jaundice, and treats abscesses and deep-rooted toxic sores, Lung abscess, breast abscess, and swollen hemorrhoids.

At present it is primarily used for bleeding disorders associated with some of the ailments listed in this passage, such as bleeding dysenteric disorders, but also for malarial disorders, swollen sores, hemorrhoids, and vaginal pruritus due to trichomonas infection. For the latter condition the young, fresh stems and leaves are often used as part of an external wash or douche.

People south of the Yangtze river in China use this herb as a qi tonic in cases of exhaustion - hence the name loss-of-strength herb (tuo li cao). For this purpose, 30g of the herb are combined with ten red dates in a strong decoction and sipped as a tea throughout the day. This has also been effectively used for bleeding ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. It can also be included in the formula Gui Pi Tang (Restore the Spleen Decoction) when bleeding is due to Spleen deficiency which renders it unable to contain the blood.
