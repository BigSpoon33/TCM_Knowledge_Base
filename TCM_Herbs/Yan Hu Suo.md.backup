## 📖 Overview

Due to its warmth and aroma, Corydalis Rhizoma (yan hu suo) disseminates the flow of qi, and because it is heavy and firm in texture, it sinks into the blood level of the Heart and Liver where its bitterness drains stasis and its acridity disperses stagnation. Its yellow color also signals an affinity to the Stomach. Its particular strength lies in its strong pain-relieving action.

In Convenient Reader of Materia Medica, Zhang Bing Cheng states that it:

"promotes the movement of qi within the blood; its quality is warm and aromatic so that it makes the qi flow smoothly to adjust the blood; its flavor is also acrid and bitter. It enters the Stomach to track down and eliminate stasis and cold pain; thrusting out to the Liver, it unblocks to treat women's menstruation."

Zhang goes on to say that because it is firm in texture, acrid, bitter, yellow, warm and aromatic, it is a herb of the Liver blood level, and can be used for any pain due to obstruction of the qi and blood. He warns, however, that "If the illness is not due to blocked obstruction of qi and blood, but involves deficiency, it is not appropriate."

Materia Medica of the Kaibao Era notes that it:

"breaks up blood stasis, and treats women's irregular menstruation, masses within the abdomen, continuous uterine bleeding, and all blood disorders in the postpartum stage [including] fainting due to blood stasis, sudden up-rushing of blood, or bleeding due to injury."

The Grand Materia Medica states that it:

"invigorates the blood, promotes the movement of qi, stops pain ... it promotes movement of qi stagnation within the blood, or blood stasis due to qi stagnation, and thus treats disorders throughout the body, whether in the upper body or the lower."
