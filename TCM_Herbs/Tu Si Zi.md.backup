## 📖 Overview

Cuscutae Semen (tu si zi) has several characteristics that make it an outstanding herb. It tonifies both the yin and yang, and does so without being cloying. It is warm without being drying. And it both secures the essence and gently encourages the movement of primal yang. It has a very wide scope of action that ranges from Spleen deficiency diarrhea or vaginal discharge, to aching soreness of the lower back and knees, to brightening the eyes. Treasury of Words on the Materia Medica describes it as:

"...an herb that tonifies the Kidneys, nourishes the Liver, warms the Spleen, and assists the Stomach. It tonifies without being drastic and warms without being drying, so that when it enters the Kidney channel, it can tonify if there is deficiency, but facilitate if there is excess; it can warm if there is coldness, but cool if there is heat; if there is dampness it can dry, but if there is dryness it can moisten."

In Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica, Miao Xi-Yong observes:

"This is an important herb for the tonification of the three organs—the Spleen, Liver, and Kidneys.... The Spleen controls the blood, unites with the muscles and flesh, and governs the four limbs; when the qi of the leg yang brightness and greater yin is abundant, one's energy grows and one becomes fat and healthy [as it says in the Divine Husbandman's Classic]. Tonifying the Spleen thus nourishes the muscle, augmenting the Liver and Kidneys thus strengthens the yin and fortifies the sinews and bones. Its warmth tonifies the yang qi in the Kidneys, and therefore it governs cold in the penis, spermatorrhea, and urinary dribbling."

In Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica, Zhang Shan-Lei elaborates:

"It is a superior substance for nourishing the yin and unblocking the collaterals. Its flavor is slightly acrid, such that within yin there is yang, it can conserve and also mobilize—quite different from other yin-nourishing herbs with their greasy, cloying quality!"

Zhang goes on to say that the acrid flavor of Cuscutae Semen (tu si zi) is not drying, but rather gently unblocks the movement of yang, and that:

"...after long-term consumption, the yin fluids are sufficient to brighten the eyes. When Miscellaneous Records [of Famous Physicians] says that it 'nourishes the yin to strengthen the muscles, and fortify the sinews and bones', this is the adjustment of both yin and yang. 'Cold in the penis with spermatorrhea' is due to lack of transport of the primal yang such that the utmost yin is unable to contain; when 'urine terminally dribbles', this refers to the Kidney yang being unable to spread and the great qi being unable to lift."

All of the statements cited by Zhang were the indications listed in Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians.

## ⚠️ Cautions & Contraindications

**Toxicity:** `= this.herb_data.toxicity`

**Contraindications:**

"Its nature is warm and drying... it is contraindicated for Kidney patients with much fire, continual unflagging erection, or dry, clumped stool." (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica)

While the Materia Medica of Combinations warns that use of the herb is forbidden during pregnancy, this is contradicted by other materia medica texts such as Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western; and it is frequently used during pregnancy in modern Chinese gynecology.
