## 📖 Overview

Schizonepetae Herba (jing jie) is quite harmonious in nature: acrid, but not overly dispersing, slightly warm, but not drying. Its light, ascending qualities, which enter the Liver and Lungs, allow it to be used for both wind-heat and wind-cold, and also for venting wind from the blood. The Treasury of Words on Materia Medica lauds it as the herb for wind in the midst of the blood, stating that each and every wind toxin condition- just at the threshold of manifesting, but not completely; about to disperse, but not dispersing- can be cleared up with the use of unprepared Schizonepetae Herba (jing jie).

Seeking Accuracy in the Materia Medica explains its interaction with Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng). Schizonepetae Herba (jing jie), it says, is not like Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng), whose qi is not light and lifting, and which must enter into the flesh and bones to drive out wind. Thus, in order to dissipate and disperse the wind pathogen, when one uses Saposhnikoviae Radix (fang feng) it is necessary to also use Schizonepetae Herba (jing jie). This is because Schizonepetae Herba (jing jie) can enter the muscles and skin to dissipate and disperse [and thus complement Saposhnikoviae Radix's (fang feng) deeper action]. Furthermore, since Schizonepetae Herba (jing jie) also enters the Liver channel- the wind and wood organ- and the Liver is the realm of blood storage, Schizonepetae Herba (jing jie) is also able to unblock and facilitate the blood vessels to treat such symptoms as nosebleed, Intestinal wind, irregular menstrual bleeding, puerperal fainting, toxic swollen sores, and blood heat. [Resolution of] all of these [symptoms] relies on its light lifting, as a tool for dissipating and draining. How could one regulate the qi in the organ of wind and wood, but not treat the blood as well?! Therefore, while Schizonepetae Herba (jing jie) enters the qi aspect of the Liver, it also enters its blood aspect.
