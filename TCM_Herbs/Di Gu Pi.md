## 📖 Overview

Sweet, bland, cold, but not intense in its actions, Lycii Cortex (*Di Gu Pi*) enters the Lung, Liver, and Kidney channels. It eliminates heat from excess in the blood by cooling it, and is therefore indicated for bleeding associated with chaotic circulation due to heat. It also treats blood heat from deficiency, and is very effective in treating sensations of heat from yin deficiency and steaming bone disorder with sweating. In addition, it clears and directs Lung fire downward to stop cough, thirst, and restless irritability. It is often used for the flushing associated with heat from deficiency, nightsweats, cough, and wheezing from Lung heat, and for nosebleeds in wasting and thirsting disorder.

According to the Grand Materia Medica, Lycii Cortex (*Di Gu Pi*) tonifies yin deficiency. While this is disputed by other writers, by eliminating the injurious effects of heat on the blood and yin, Lycii Cortex (*Di Gu Pi*) is able to preserve their integrity, and thus, in effect, to tonify them.

Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica notes: "This substance is cool but not intense. It can regulate deficient and consumptive disorders. Its aroma is light and acrid, thus cooling the Lungs." Wang Hao-Gu adds that Lycii Cortex (*Di Gu Pi*) "directs lurking fire in the Lungs downward."

In Essays on Medicine Esteeming the Chinese and Respecting the Western, Zhang Xi-Chun explains his understanding of the origin of these qualities:

This root drives deep into the earth, and is full of yin qi, so it is cool by nature and is excellent at reducing heat. Because its vigor tends downward, it has the power to restrain and inhibit, and this is why it treats steaming bones with sweating. It can stop the spitting up of blood and nosebleeds, and especially directs downward and clears Kidney heat. It unblocks and facilitates both bowel movements and urination, and treats bleeding due to heat in both the stool and urine. Furthermore, its ability to restrain and drive downward can clear and direct downward the heat that floats and drifts in the upper burner, thus curing cough due to heat in the Lungs. This is why most of the materia medica [texts] mention that it treats cough. Yet it is forbidden for cough due to pathogenic wind in the Lungs, as its nature is restraining.
