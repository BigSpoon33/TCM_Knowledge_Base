## 📖 Overview

Acrid, bitter, and warm, Cnidii Fructus (she chuang zi) warms the Kidneys, assists the yang, expels wind, dries dampness, and kills parasites. It treats male impotence, damp itching of the scrotum, genital itching with vaginal discharge in females, infertility due to cold in the uterus, wind-damp painful obstruction, scabies, lichen simplex, and damp sores. Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica notes that "The warmth of Cnidii Fructus (she chuang zi) is sudden and violent. ... Kidney yang must be listless, and cold [pathogenic] water must be flooding before it is used internally."

The Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica states that this substance "Governs swelling and pain in the female genitals, impotence in the male, and damp itching. Expels painful obstruction qi, facilitates the joints, [treats] seizures and noxious wounds." Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians adds that it "Warms the middle, drives qi downward, makes the female Womb hot and strengthens the male genitals, improves the complexion, and makes people have children."

With respect to using Cnidii Fructus (she chuang zi) for painful obstruction, Rectification of the Meaning of Materia Medica explains that "It basically unblocks and promotes movement in the channels and collaterals, dredges and unblocks the joints." This passage goes on to say that it is only appropriate for these purposes if the blockage is due to cold-dampness.
