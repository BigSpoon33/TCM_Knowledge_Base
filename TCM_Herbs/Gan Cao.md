## üìñ Overview

Sweet and harmonious, Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cao) enters all the twelve channels via the Heart, Lung, Spleen and Stomach channels. Its therapeutic actions differ substantially depending on whether it is used in its prepared or unprepared form. Unprepared, it drains fire and resolves toxicity; prepared, it tonifies the qi of the Spleen and Heart. Yet, as several texts observe, even though it drains fire, this is not a bitter-cold type of draining, but rather a moderation of fire's intensity by virtue of its sweet flavor. Its primary actions are to tonify the Spleen and augment the qi, moisten the Lungs and stop coughs, moderate acuteness or urgency (such as acute pain), and moderate the nature of other herbs with which it is used. Entering all twelve channels has two implications: it can guide the actions of other herbs into channels which they would not normally affect, and its own actions reach throughout the body, although they are strongest in the organs with which it is most closely associated: Heart, Lungs, Spleen, and Stomach.

Transforming the Significance of Medicinal Substances notes:
Used unprepared, it is cooling and drains fire: it primarily disperses pathogens in the exterior, reduces swollen sores, eases sore throat, resolves the toxicity of all herbs, eliminates accumulated fire in the Stomach, dispels urinary tract pain- this is the power of sweet coolness eliminating heat. Used prepared, it is warming and tonifies the middle: it governs diarrhea due to Spleen deficiency, thirst due to Stomach deficiency, cough due to either heat or cold, shortness of breath, lassitude, consumption, deficiency, or [internal] injury-this is the power of sweet warmth reinforcing the Spleen.

Records of Thoughtful Differentiation of Materia Medica observes that it
is yellow in the middle, with a reddish bark, certainly an herb of the Spleen and Heart channels. However, the five yin organs and the six yang organs each receives qi from the Spleen, while the Heart is the ruler of the entire body. The flavor of Glycyrrhizae Radix (gan cao) is the ultimate in sweetness, and its nature is supremely harmonious; thus from the Spleen and Heart it involves all the other yin and yang organs, reaching everywhere, expelling every pathogen. Its effects are completely due to its sweetness, by which it tonifies, by which it moderates. Whenever the sage [Zhang] Zhong-Jing prescribed it in formulas, he used it in its prepared form to tonify or moderate urgency, but in its unprepared form to drain fire-yet even this 'draining' involved the idea of moderation.

## ‚ö° Functions & Actions

- Tonifies the Spleen and augments the qi: commonly used for Spleen deficiency with shortness of breath, lassitude, and loose stools. Also for qi or blood deficiency patterns with an irregular or intermittent pulse and/or palpitations.
    - With Codonopsis Radix (dang shen) and Poria (fu ling) to strengthen the Spleen and augment the qi, as in Four Gentleman Decoction (si jun zi tang).
    - With Cinnamomi Ramulus (gui zhi), Rehmanniae Radix (sheng di huang), and Asini Corii Colla (e jiao) for insufficiency of the Heart qi and blood manifesting in an irregular heartbeat, as in Honey-Prepared Licorice Decoction (zhi gan cao tang).
- Moistens the Lungs and stops coughs: for cough and wheezing. Because of its neutral properties, it can be used for either heat or cold in the Lungs and for either productive or nonproductive coughs.
    - With Ephedrae Herba (ma huang) and Armeniacae Semen (xing ren) for coughs due to wind-cold invading the Lungs, as in Three-Unbinding Decoction (san ao tang).
    - With Mori Folium (sang ye) and Platycodi Radix (jie geng) for wind-heat invading the Lungs, as in Mulberry Leaf and Chrysanthemum Drink (sang ju yin).
    - With Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao) and Armeniacae Semen (xing ren) for coughs due to Lung heat, as in Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Gypsum, and Licorice Decoction (ma xing shi gan tang).
- Moderates spasms and alleviates pain: for painful spasms of the abdomen or legs. Traditionally, this effect is only seen when combined with Paeoniae Radix alba (bai shao), as in Peony and Licorice Decoction (shao yao gan cao tang).
    - Add Scutellariae Radix (huang qin) and Arecae Semen (bing lang) for abdominal pain and dysenteric diarrhea from damp-heat, as in Peony Decoction (shao yao tang).
    - Add Bupleuri Radix (chai hu) and Angelicae sinensis Radix (dang gui) for hypochondriac pain due to Liver qi constraint, as in Rambling Powder (xiao yao san).
    - With Sepiae Endoconcha (hai piao xiao) and Citri reticulatae Pericarpium (chen pi) for the pain of peptic ulcers.
- Clears heat and resolves fire toxicity: used unprepared for carbuncles, sores, or sore throat due to fire toxin. For this purpose, it can be taken internally or applied topically.
    - With Lonicerae Flos (jin yin hua) and Taraxaci Herba (pu gong ying) for sores marked by redness, swelling, and pain.
    - With Rehmanniae Radix preparata (shu di huang), Cinnamomi Cortex (rou gui), and Sinapis Semen (bai jie zi) for chronic yin-type swellings that do not ulcerate, or have dark ulcerations that do not close, as in Yang-Heartening Decoction (yang he tang).
    - With Genkwa Flos (yuan hua) as an externally-applied decoction for chilblain.
    - With Platycodi Radix (jie geng) for sore throat in which the throat is not very red.
    - Add Sophorae tonkinensis Radix (shan dou gen) and Scrophulariae Radix (xuan shen) if there is significant redness and swelling or development of pus.
- Also used as an antidote for a variety of toxic substances, both internally and topically.
    - With Phaseoli radiati Semen (l√º dou) and Lonicerae Flos (jin yin hua) as an antidote.
- Moderates and harmonizes the characteristics of other herbs: by virtue of its sweet, neutral, and moderating properties, this herb moderates hot and cold herbs, and mitigates the harsh properties of other herbs. Because it is said to enter all twelve primary channels, it can lead and conduct other herbs into the channels. It is often used to moderate such combinations as Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata (zhi fu zi) and Zingiberis Rhizoma (gan jiang); Gypsum fibrosum (shi gao) and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma (zhi mu); and Rhei Radix et Rhizoma (da huang) and Natrii Sulfas (mang xiao).
