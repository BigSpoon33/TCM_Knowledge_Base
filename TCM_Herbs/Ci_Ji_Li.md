gastrodia is said to be of inferior quality, even when compared 
to the cultivated product, except in the provinces of Jiangsu and 
Zhejiang. 
Although the wild-crafted winter gastrodia is said to be of superior 
quality, it should no longer be used. Gastrodia elata is listed as an 
endangered species and export of the herb collected in the wild 
is generally restricted. In the past, cultivation of gastrodia was 
thought to be impossible. However, over the last thirty years, the 
Medicines Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences 
has developed a method of artificial production using the sym-
biotic relationship between Gastrodia elata and the widespread 
wood decay fungi Armillaria mellea, commonly known as honey 
fungus. The fungus produces coils in the cells of the tuber, and 
these coils are digested by the plant as a source of nutrition, 
thereby supporting the growth of the Gastrodia orchid. At present, 
the share of the cultivated product in China' s domestic market 
exceeds 80 percent. 
Gastrodia elata is listed under Appendix II of the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 
(CITES), which requires a permit both for export from China and 
import to other countries, and may therefore be difficult to obtain.

Commentary 
Acrid, such that it disperses, and bitter, such that it drains, 
Tribuli Fructus (d ji If) is light in weight, enabling it to 
reach the upper burner to calm the Liver and extinguish 
internal wind, while at the same time dredging Liver and 
Lung wind-heat, relieving Liver constraint, promoting the 
flow of qi, and breaking up blood stasis. It is used in the 
treatment of headaches or dizziness from ascendant Liver 
yang; red eyes and excessive lacrimation from wind-heat; 
wind-heat causing itching from wind-rash; and pain in the 
chest and flanks, irregular menstruation, breast abscess, or 
difficult lactation associated with Liver constraint stagnat-
ing the flow of qi. For insufficient lactation accompanied 
by painful breasts, it has been used as a stand-alone herb, 
dry-fried and ground into a powder. 
Encountering the Sources of the Classic of Materia Medica 
states that it "is an important herb for treating wind and to 
brighten the eyes." 
In an entry emphasizing the acrid-dispersing properties 
of the herb, the Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia 
Medica states: "Governs noxious blood, breaks up fixed 
abdominal masses, clumping, gathered accumulations, 
throat painful obstruction, and urinary difficulty." 
Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians adds: "Gov-
erns wind-itching all over the body, headache, cough and 
rebellion injuring the Lungs, and Lung atrophy disorder; 
stops irritability, and directs the qi downward." 
Confusion with Astragali complanati Semen (sha yuan 
zf), originally known as white ji li (a lf,. ~ bdi j£ li), led 
some writers to attribute tonifying properties to this herb, 
a misunderstanding which was laid to rest by Zhang Bing-
Cheng in Convenient Reader of Materia Medica: 
It excels at travelling and breaking up, specifically enter-
ing the Lungs and Liver to disseminate Lung stagnation 
and disperse stasis in the Liver. Thus it treats wind painful 
obstruction, eye disorders, breast abscess, and gathered 
accumulations. Warm, bitter, acrid-dispersing things are 
used for expelling and driving out-this has no tonifying or 
augmenting effects. 
Mechanisms of Selected Combinations 
~ WITH ASTRAGALI COMPLANATI SEMEN (shayuan zf}; 
see page 805 
Comparisons 
~ Vs. EQUISETI HIEMALIS HERBA (mil zei) 
Both herbs dredge and disperse wind-heat, brighten the 
eyes, and stop itching, and can be combined in the treat-
ment of these conditions. However, Tribuli Fructus (d ji 
If) can calm the Liver and extinguish internal wind, and 
dredge the Liver to promote the flow of stagnant qi and 
blood. Equiseti hiemalis Herba (mil zei), on the other hand, 
releases the muscle layer and expels wind-dampness, and 
more strongly grinds down superficial visual obstructions, 
for which it is specific.

Traditional Contraindications 
"Contraindicated in two cases: Liver deficiency and preg-
nancy." (Medicinal Combining) 
"Those with insufficient yin and blood, illnesses due to 
parched dryness of the essence, marrow, and blood- in 
both cases it is contraindicated." (Treasury of Words on the 
Materia Medica) 
"Carefully examining its nature, it simply drains qi and 
breaks up blood, which is why it can abort a fetus. Ancient 
prescriptions that used it to tonify the Kidneys were mis-
taking it for Astragali complanati Semen (sha yuan zl) 
[similar name]." (Harm and Benefit in the Materia Medica) 
Toxicity 
Tribuli Fructus is slightly toxic due to the content of potas-
sium nitrite, but within the normal dosage range no toxic 
effects are to be expected. Overdosage may cause general 
weakness, drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, palpita-
tions, rapid breathing, quick pulse, cyanosis, and, in severe 
cases, pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. Allergic 
skin reactions have also been reported. 
Nomenclature & Preparation 
In some sources this herb is simply known as lf- ~ ji li. 
However, to differentiate it from Astragali complanati 
Semen (sha yuan zf), which has also been known as )j,' ~ 
lf- ~ sha yuan ji Li or ii lf- ~ tong jf 1{, it is called prickly 
jf li ( .1i1) lf- ~ cl ji li). Another common name, related to its 
color, is white ji li (a lf,. ~ bdi ji If) 
Li Shi-Zhen explained its different names: 
The meaning of Jf. jf is affliction [as in the word §.. j{] , 
whereas ~ [{means sharp. Its spikes injure people, quite 
afflicting and sharp. [Its other names, such as] bends per-
son (lib A qu ren) or stops travel ( .ll::.H zhi x(ng) are both 
because it injures people. 
The Latin name Tribulus terrestris likewise reflects the ini-
tial human contact with this plant. In some places, to dif-

977 
ferentiate this herb from Astragali complanati Semen (sha 
yuan zf), the term prickly ji li (i!i1] if- ~ cl ji lf) is used. 
:» DRY-FRIED TRmuu FRucTus (~Y.ili 1] if-~ chao d jf If) 
The dried fruit is dry-fried until darker yellow. This meth-
od of preparation reduces its acrid-dispersing qualities, 
enhancing its ability to calm the Liver, anchor the yang, 
soothe the Liver, and release constraint. It is most often 
used in the treatment of Liver yang headaches and dizzi-
ness, pain in the chest and flanks, and insufficient lacta-
tion.
