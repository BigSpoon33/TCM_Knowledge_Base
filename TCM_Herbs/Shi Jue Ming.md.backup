## 📖 Overview

(Shi jue ming) Salty, cold, and heavy, Haliotidis Concha enters the Liver channel to cool the Liver and calm ascendant Liver yang. The Liver governs wind, and the orifice of the Liver is the eyes; if blood is deficient and the Liver is hot, wind-fire blazes upward and the Liver yang follows it causing dizziness, vertigo, and headaches. In severe cases it will lead to insidous onset of loss of vision without visible physical changes to the eye. Not only does Haliotidis Concha (shi jue ming) cool the Liver and anchor the Liver yang, it also enriches and nourishes the Liver yin, and thus addresses both the branch manifestation and the basic root of the condition.

Commentary on the Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica states that it is a medicinal of the leg terminal yin channel, the orifice of which is the eyes: 'when the eyes obtain blood, vision is possible.' If blood is deficient, and there is heat, insidous onset of loss of vision without visible physical changes to the eye, and superficial visual obstructions, are generated. Salty coldness enters the blood to eliminate heat, and therefore this governs eye diseases.

Master Shen's Book for Revering Life says that "Haliotidis Concha (shi jue ming) greatly tonifies the Liver yin: when the Liver channel is deficient, one definitely cannot do without it."
