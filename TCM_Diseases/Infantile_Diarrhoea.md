# ü©∫ Infantile Diarrhoea

## üìñ Overview

Infantile diarrhoea is a common pediatric disease characterized by disharmony of the spleen and stomach, leading to frequent bowel movements with loose or watery feces. Due to the inherent weakness of the spleen and stomach in children, this condition is easily precipitated by either exogenous pathogenic factors or internal injury from milk and food. It can occur in any season, but is more prevalent in summer and autumn.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Frequent bowel movements
- Loose or watery feces
- Disharmony of spleen and stomach
- Abdominal distension
- Borborygmi
- Abdominal pain relieved after defecation

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Invasion of exogenous pathogenic factors
2. Internal injury of milk and food (overfeeding)
3. Irregular diet
4. Contaminated food
5. Improper attending/nursing

### Pathological Mechanism
The inherently weak spleen and stomach of children are susceptible to injury from irregular diet, contaminated food, or improper care. This leads to dysfunction in the spleen and stomach's transportation and transformation functions, resulting in indigestion. Undigested food and water are not properly separated and instead pass together into the large intestine, causing diarrhoea. Food retention can lead to putrefaction. Additionally, delicate zang-fu organs in infants make them vulnerable to exogenous pathogenic factors, which can also impair spleen and stomach function and cause diarrhoea.

**Affected Organs:** Spleen, Stomach, Large Intestine

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Diarrhoea due to Overfeeding

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Abdominal distension
- Borborygmi
- Frequent fits of pain followed by bowel movements
- Pain relieved after defecation
- Sour and putrid feces
- Undigested milk and food in fecal discharge
- Frequent eructation
- Anorexia

**Tongue:** Sticky tongue coating
**Pulse:** Rolling and full pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Undigested milk or food accumulated in the intestines and the stomach causes abdominal distension with borborygmi and frequent attacks of pain with the desire of emptying the bowels. The pain is relieved after defecation as the food stagnation is somewhat removed. Stagnation of food leads to putrefaction, making the feces sour and putrid. The weakened spleen and stomach fail to digest food, hence there is undigested milk or food in the feces. The putrid turbidity may ascend, so there is frequent eructation. Dysfunction of the spleen and stomach in transportation and transformation gives rise to anorexia. The sticky tongue coating and rolling pulse are both the signs of food retention.

### Pattern 2: Diarrhoea due to [[Damp]] Heat

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Loose stools with yellow colour and offensive smell
- Abdominal pain
- Fever
- Thirst
- Burning sensation at the anus
- Scanty and dark urine

**Tongue:** Yellow and sticky tongue coating
**Pulse:** Rolling and rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
The pathogenic [[damp]] heat accumulated in the stomach and the intestines causes impairment of transportation. When the [[damp]] heat flows downward, there are loose stools with yellow colour and offensive smell, and abdominal pain. Accumulation of damp heat in the stomach and intestines brings on fever and thirst. Burning sensation at the anus and scanty dark urine are also due to the downward flow of damp heat. Yellow sticky tongue coating and rolling rapid pulse are signs of damp heat.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Diarrhoea due to Overfeeding

**Treatment Principle:** Adjust the spleen and stomach, promote digestion to remove stagnation, strengthen transportation to stop diarrhoea, remove food stagnation, alleviate abdominal distension and fullness, and reinforce the spleen and stomach.

**Needle Technique:** In-And-Out Puncturing

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[ST-25]] | Regulate intestines and check diarrhoea |
| [[ST-37]] | Regulate intestines and check diarrhoea |
| [[Sifeng (Extra)]] | Promote digestion to remove stagnation and strengthen transportation to stop diarrhoea |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Diarrhoea due to overfeeding:**
- [[REN-11]]
- [[REN-6]]

#### Explanation
Tianshu (S 25) is a point of the Stomach Meridian of Foot Yangming, and also the Front-(Mu) Point of the large intestine, while Shangjuxu (S 37) is the Lower He-(Sea) Point of the large intestine. The combination of these two points can regulate the intestines and check diarrhoea. Sifeng (Extra) can promote digestion to remove the stagnation, and strengthen transportation to stop diarrhoea. If the diarrhoea is due to overfeeding, Jianli (Ren 11) and Qihai (Ren 6) are combined in order to remove the stagnation of food, alleviate abdominal distension and fullness, and reinforce the spleen and stomach.

### Pattern: Diarrhoea due to Damp Heat

**Treatment Principle:** Adjust the spleen and stomach, eliminate damp heat, clear away heat, eliminate dampness, and stop diarrhoea.

**Needle Technique:** In-And-Out Puncturing

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[ST-25]] | Regulate intestines and check diarrhoea |
| [[ST-37]] | Regulate intestines and check diarrhoea |
| [[Sifeng (Extra)]] | Promote digestion to remove stagnation and strengthen transportation to stop diarrhoea |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Diarrhoea due to damp heat:**
- [[L I 11]]
- [[L I 4]]
- [[SP-9]]

#### Explanation
Tianshu (S 25) is a point of the Stomach Meridian of Foot Yangming, and also the Front-(Mu) Point of the large intestine, while Shangjuxu (S 37) is the Lower He-(Sea) Point of the large intestine. The combination of these two points can regulate the intestines and check diarrhoea. Sifeng (Extra) can promote digestion to remove the stagnation, and strengthen transportation to stop diarrhoea. If the diarrhoea is caused by damp heat, Quchi (L I 11), Hegu (L I 4) are used to clear away the heat, and Yinlingquan (Sp 9) to eliminate dampness and check diarrhoea.

## üìä Prognosis

Severe diarrhoea may lead to critical conditions, potentially causing damage of both [[yin and yang]], collapse of qi, and exhaustion of yin.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention & Prophylaxis

Prevention involves avoiding irregular diets, contaminated food, and improper attending. Prophylactic measures include ensuring a light diet of small quantity.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Clinical Remarks

Attention should be paid to severe diarrhoea which may lead to the critical condition of the damage of both [[yin and yang]], collapse of qi and exhaustion of yin. The diet should be restricted and a light diet of small quantity is preferable.
