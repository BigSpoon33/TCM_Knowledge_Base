# ü©∫ Impotence

## üìñ Overview

Impotence is defined as the lack of copulative power in males. Its underlying causes typically involve either a deficiency of Mingmen [[fire]] and kidney essence, or the downward accumulation of [[damp]]-heat.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Lack of copulative power in males
- Primarily associated with decline of [[fire]] (deficiency) in the majority of cases
- Less commonly associated with excess of [[fire]] ([[damp]]-heat)

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Indulgence in sex or excessive masturbation
2. Fear, fright or worry
3. Greasy food and wine

### Pathological Mechanism
Impotence generally results from indulgence in sex or excessive masturbation, which leads to the decline of Mingmen fire and exhaustion of kidney essence. Emotional factors such as fear, fright, or worry can damage the qi of the heart, spleen, and kidney, thereby causing dysfunction of the kidney and damage to the mind, as stated in *Treatment of Internal Disorders*. Additionally, consumption of greasy food and wine may impair the spleen and stomach's function of transportation and transformation, leading to dampness that transforms into heat. This [[damp]]-heat then drives downward, preventing penile erection. Zhang Jingyue noted that seven to eight out of ten impotent patients are caused by the decline of fire, with only a few cases attributed to excess of fire (damp-heat).

**Affected Organs:** Kidney, Heart, Spleen, Stomach

### Pattern 2: Damp Heat Driving Downward

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Inability of penis to erect

**Tongue:** Not mentioned
**Pulse:** Not mentioned

#### TCM Analysis
This pattern results from greasy food and wine damaging the spleen and stomach's transportation and transformation functions, leading to dampness that turns into heat. This damp-heat then drives downward, obstructing penile erection. This type of impotence is not very common, representing only a few cases according to Zhang Jingyue's observation.
