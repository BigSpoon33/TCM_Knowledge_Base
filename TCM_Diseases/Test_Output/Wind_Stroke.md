# ðŸ©º Wind Stroke

## ðŸ“– Overview

Wind stroke is an emergency case manifested by falling down in a fit with loss of consciousness, or hemiplegia, slurred speech and deviated mouth. It is characterized by abrupt onset with pathological changes varying quickly like the wind.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Emergency case
- Abrupt onset
- Falling down in a fit with loss of consciousness
- Hemiplegia
- Slurred speech
- Deviated mouth
- Pathological changes vary quickly

---

## ðŸ§¬ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Aged individuals in poor health with deficiency of qi and blood
2. Deficiency in the lower part of the body and excess in the upper part
3. Deficiency of kidney yin due to sexual indulgence
4. Irregular food intake impeding spleen's transportation/transformation, leading to phlegm from accumulated dampness and transformation into heat
5. Exasperation
6. Agitation
7. Alcohol indulgence or overeating
8. Overstrain and stress
9. Invasion of exogenous pathogenic wind

### Pathological Mechanism
Various etiological factors lead to an imbalance of yin and yang in the zang-fu organs. This commonly involves an upsurge of liver yang and heart fire, causing qi and blood to ascend together with turbid phlegm, which then disturbs the mind. In mild cases, dysfunction is limited to the meridians and collaterals. In severe cases, both zang-fu organs and meridians/collaterals are affected. Zang-fu involvement can manifest as tense (excess) syndrome due to phlegm-heat disturbing the mind or excessive fire in the heart and liver, or flaccid (deficiency) syndrome from deficiency of primary qi or collapse of kidney yang. Untreated tense syndrome may progress to flaccid syndrome.

**Affected Organs:** Kidney, Spleen, Heart, Liver, Zang-fu organs (general), Meridians and Collaterals

---

## ðŸ”¬ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Tense syndrome (Attack on the zang-fu organs)

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Falling down in a fit with loss of consciousness
- Tightly closed hands
- Clenched jaws
- Flushed face
- Coarse breathing
- Rattling in the throat
- Retention of urine
- Constipation

**Tongue:** Red tongue with thick yellow or dark grey coating
**Pulse:** String-taut, rolling and forceful pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Wind stirred up by upsurge of liver yang sends qi and blood upwards, which together with the accumulated phlegm fire disturb the mind, leading to sudden loss of consciousness with tightly closed hands and clenched jaws, flushed face, coarse breathing, retention of urine and constipation. Excessive wind phlegm brings about rattling in the throat. Red tongue with thick yellow coating or dark grey coating, string-taut, rolling and forceful pulse are the signs of wind combined with phlegm fire.

---

### Pattern 2: Flaccid syndrome (Attack on the zang-fu organs)

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Falling down in a fit and sudden loss of consciousness
- Mouth agape
- Eyes closed
- Snoring but feeble breathing
- Flaccid paralysis of limbs
- Incontinence of urine
- Cold limbs (severe cases)
- Flushing of face as rouged (severe cases)

**Tongue:** Flaccid tongue
**Pulse:** Thready, weak pulse; fading or big floating pulse (severe cases)

#### TCM Analysis
Severe weakness of primary qi, separation of yin and yang and exhaustion of qi in the zang organs are indicated in mouth agape, eyes closed, snoring but feeble breathing, flaccid paralysis, and incontinence of urine. Flaccid tongue and thready weak pulse suggest the deficiency of blood and prostration of the kidney yang. If complicated with cold limbs, flushed face, fading or big floating pulse, it is a critical case, indicating exhaustion of yin in the lower portion of the body and upward going of the isolated yang.

---

### Pattern 3: Attack on the meridians and collaterals

**Type:** Mixed

#### Main Manifestations
- Hemiplegia
- Numbness of the limbs
- Deviated mouth
- Slurring of speech
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Vertigo
- Twitching of muscles
- Red eyes
- Flushed face
- Thirst
- Dryness of the throat
- Irritability

**Pulse:** String taut and rolling pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Wind phlegm enters the meridians and collaterals due to imbalance of yin and yang, or after treatment the functions of the affected zang-fu organs have been restored, but wind phlegm still blocks the meridians and collaterals, causing retarded circulation of qi and blood. Hence appears hemiplegia, numbness of the limbs, deviated mouth and slurring of speech. If complicated with upsurging of liver yang, and upward disturbance of wind yang, the symptoms are headache, dizziness, vertigo and twitching of muscles. If there is excessive fire in the heart and liver, there may be red eyes and flushed face, thirst, dryness of the throat and irritability. Stagnation of wind phlegm in the meridians and collaterals leads to a string-taut and rolling pulse.

## ðŸ’‰ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Tense syndrome (Attack on the zang-fu organs)

**Treatment Principle:** Promote resuscitation, reduce wind and fire and resolve phlegm.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing/Pricking, To Cause Little Bleeding

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Baihui (Du 20)]] | Regulate qi of the Du Meridian, effect resuscitation |
| [[Shuigou (Du 26)]] | Regulate qi of the Du Meridian, effect resuscitation |
| [[Fenglong (S 40)]] | Invigorate functions of spleen and stomach, resolve turbid phlegm |
| [[Taichong (Liv 3)]] | Subdue the upsurging of qi in the Liver Meridian, pacify the liver yang |
| [[Yongquan (K 1)]] | Conduct heat downward |
| [[twelve Jing-(Well) points on both hands (L 11, H 9, P 9, LI 1, SJ 1, SI 1)]] | Dispel heat and regain consciousness |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Clenched Jaws:**
- [[Xiaguan (S 7)]]
- [[Jiache (S 6)]]
- [[Hegu (L 14)]]

**For Aphasia and stiffness of tongue:**
- [[Yamen (Du 15)]]
- [[Lianquan (Ren 23)]]
- [[Tongli (H 5)]]

#### Explanation
As the condition is due to disturbance of the heart by phlegm fire associated with upsurging of liver yang and upward flowing of qi and blood, Baihui (Du 20) and Shuigou (Du 26) are selected to regulate qi of the Du Meridian, effecting resuscitation, Yongquan (K 1) is selected to conduct the heat downward, and Taichong (Liv 3) to subdue the upsurging of qi in the Liver Meridian and pacify the liver yang. Pricking the twelve Jing-(Well) points on both hands, where qi of the three yin and three yang meridians meet, may dispel heat and regain consciousness. The spleen and stomach are the source of phlegm production. Fenglong (S 40), the Luo-(Connecting) point of the Stomach Meridian can invigorate the functions of the spleen and stomach and help to resolve the turbid phlegm. Since the Yangming Meridians of Hand and Foot supply the cheeks, Xiaguan (S 7), Jiache (S 6) and Hegu (LI 4) are chosen to promote the circulation of qi and blood for relieving the clenched jaws. Yamen (Du 15) and Lianquan (Ren 23), being local and adjacent points of the tongue, and Tongli (H 5), the Luo-(Connecting) point of the Heart Meridian, may relieve stiffness of tongue.

### Pattern: Flaccid syndrome (Attack on the zang-fu organs)

**Treatment Principle:** Restore yang from collapse.

**Needle Technique:** Moxibustion

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Shenque (Ren 8)]] | Main point effective for collapse, strengthens primary qi, restores yang |
| [[Qihai (Ren 6)]] | Main point effective for collapse, strengthens primary qi, restores yang |
| [[Guanyuan (Ren 4)]] | Main point effective for collapse, strengthens primary qi, restores yang; meeting point of Ren Meridian and three yin meridians |

#### Explanation
Shenque (Ren 8), Qihai (Ren 6) and Guanyuan (Ren 4) are located on the lower abdomen along the Ren Meridian and are the main points effective for collapse. Heavy moxibustion applied on Guanyuan (Ren 4), a meeting point of the Ren Meridian and three yin meridians, can strengthen the primary qi, and restore yang from collapse.

---

### Pattern: Attack on the meridians and collaterals

**Treatment Principle:** Regulate qi and blood, remove obstruction from the meridians and collaterals and reduce the wind.

**Needle Technique:** Even Movement First From The Healthy Side And Then The Affected Side; Reducing For Excess Conditions; Reinforcing For Deficiency (E.G., Nourishing Yin).

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Baihui (Du 20)]] | Eliminate wind and remove obstruction from the meridians and collaterals |
| [[Tongtian (B 7)]] | Eliminate wind and remove obstruction from the meridians and collaterals |

| [[Jiexi (S 41)]] | Regulate qi and blood, promote smooth circulation in the upper and lower portions of the body |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Upward disturbance of wind yang:**
- [[Fengchi (G 20)]]
- [[Taichong (Liv 3)]]
- [[Taixi (K 3)]]
- [[Sanyinjiao (Sp 6)]]

**For Excessive fire in the heart and liver:**
- [[Daling (P 7)]]
- [[Xingjian (Liv 2)]]
- [[Taixi (K 3)]]

**For Deviated mouth:**
- [[Dicang (S 4)]]
- [[Jiache (S 6)]]

#### Explanation
Du Meridian is the sea of all yang meridians. Baihui (Du 20), Fengfu (Du 16) combined with Tongtian (B 7) can eliminate wind and remove obstruction from the meridians and collaterals. Since the yang meridians dominate the exterior of the body and qi, points of the yang meridians are selected to regulate qi and blood of the body and promote smooth circulation in the upper and lower portions of the body. For the upper disturbance of wind yang, Fengchi (G 20) and Taichong (Liv 3) are selected to reduce the wind and pacify the liver. Reinforcing applied to Taixi (K 3) promotes the production of the kidney yin to nourish the liver. Reinforcing applied to Sanyinjiao (Sp 6) nourishes yin and pacifies yang. For excessive fire in the heart and liver, reducing Daling (P 7) and Xingjian (Liv 2) can eliminate the fire, while reinforcing to Taixi (K 3) nourishes yin to reduce the fire. Dicang (S 4) and Jiache (S 6) are selected for the purpose of promoting a free circulation of qi in the meridians and collaterals around the facial region.

## ðŸ“Š Prognosis

In untreated or improperly treated cases, the tense syndrome tends to become flaccid, and the prognosis is often poor.
