# ü©∫ Amenorrhea

## üìñ Overview

Amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menstruation until age 18 or suppression of menstruation for over three months, excluding normal physiological states like pregnancy and lactation. It is primarily caused by either deficiency of blood or excess pathogenic factors obstructing menstrual flow.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Absence of menses for months
- Suppression of menstruation for over three months

## üè• Western Medicine Correlation

**Modern Diagnosis:**
- Endocrinal factors
- Neuropsychiatrical factors

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Seven emotional disturbances leading to liver qi stagnation (Blood Stagnation)
2. Improper intake of food or overstrain undermining qi and blood (Blood Depletion)
3. Severe or chronic diseases consuming blood (Blood Depletion)
4. Grand multipara or indulgence in sexual life exhausting essence and blood (Blood Depletion)

### Pathological Mechanism
The pathological mechanisms involve either blood stagnation, often due to emotional disturbances leading to liver qi stagnation and obstruction of qi and blood in the uterus and Chong and Ren Meridians, or blood depletion, resulting from improper diet, overstrain, chronic illness, grand multipara, or excessive sexual activity, which consume essence and blood, thereby draining the sea of blood and depriving the Chong and Ren Meridians of nourishment.

**Affected Organs:** Uterus, Liver, Spleen, Kidney, Chong Meridian, Ren Meridian

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Blood stagnation

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Absence of menses for months
- Lower abdominal distending pain aggravated by pressure
- Hard mass in lower abdomen
- Distension and fullness in the chest and hypochondriac region

**Tongue:** dark purple tongue coating with purplish spots on its borders
**Pulse:** deep string-taut pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Worry and anger cause qi stagnation and failure of it to control blood, bringing on blockage of the Chong and Ren Meridians and amenorrhea. The abnormal function of qi gives rise to lower abdominal distending pain and fullness in the chest and epigastrium. Blood stasis retaining in the sea of blood hinders menstrual flow, manifested by the abdominal pain aggravated by pressure and hard mass in the lower abdomen. Purple tongue coating with purplish spots on its borders and deep string-taut pulse are signs of stagnation of qi and blood.

---

### Pattern 2: Blood depletion

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Delayed menstrual cycle
- Gradual decrease of menses and amenorrhea
- Sallow complexion in prolonged cases
- Lassitude
- Vertigo and dizziness
- Poor appetite
- Loose stools
- Dry skin
- Dizziness and tinnitus
- Sore and weak low back and knees
- Dry mouth and throat
- Hot sensation in the palms, soles and epigastrium
- Afternoon fever and night sweating

**Tongue:** pale tongue with white coating; pale tongue with little coating
**Pulse:** slow weak pulse; string-taut and thready pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Blood is transferred from food through the function of transportation and transformation of the spleen, and dysfunction of the spleen leads to blood deficiency. Blood deficiency causes malnutrition of the Chong and Ren Meridians and the voidness in the sea of blood. Hemorrhage causes exhaustion of blood, and finally delayed menstrual cycle and the gradual decrease of menses till amenorrhea. Blood deficiency fails to nourish the muscles, skin and head, bringing on sallow complexion, dry skin, vertigo and dizziness and lassitude. Dysfunction of transportation and transformation of the spleen gives rise to poor appetite and loose stools. Pale tongue with white coating and slow, weak pulse are signs of blood depletion. Since the kidney dominates bone and marrow, while the brain is the sea of marrow, deficiency in the kidney may lead to dizziness, tinnitus, sore and weak low back and knees. Yin deficiency produces internal heat manifested by the dry mouth and throat, hot sensation in palms, soles and epigastrium, afternoon fever and the night sweating. Pale tongue and string-taut thready pulse are signs of deficiency of essence and blood.

### Pattern: Blood depletion

**Treatment Principle:** Tonify blood and restore menses.

**Needle Technique:** Reinforcing/Moxibustion

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[REN-4]] | replenish kidney qi |
| [[BL-18]] | promote the blood in the liver, where blood is stored |
| [[BL-20]] | strengthen the function of the spleen and stomach |
| [[BL-23]] | replenish kidney qi |
| [[ST-36]] | strengthen the function of the spleen and stomach |
| [[SP-6]] | strengthen the function of the spleen and stomach |

#### Explanation
The spleen, the foundation of the acquired essence, abstracts nutrient particles from food and transforms them into qi and blood. When blood supply is abundant the menstrual cycle is normal. So Pishu (B 20), Zusanli (S 36) and Sanyinjiao (Sp 6) are selected to strengthen the function of the spleen and stomach. The kidney is the foundation of congenital essence, and ample kidney qi guarantees sufficient qi and blood. For this reason Shenshu (B 23) and Guanyuan (Ren 4) are chosen to replenish kidney qi. Ganshu (B 18) is selected to promote the blood in the liver, where blood is stored. When the spleen, liver and kidney carry out well their functions of controlling blood, storing blood and essence respectively, the Chong and Ren Meridians are well nourished and amenorrhea is cured.
