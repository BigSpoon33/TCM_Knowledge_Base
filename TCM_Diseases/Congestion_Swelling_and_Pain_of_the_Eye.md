# ü©∫ Congestion, Swelling and Pain of the Eye

## üìñ Overview

Congestion, swelling and pain of the eye is an acute condition involving various external eye disorders. It is characterized by inflammation, discomfort, and visual disturbances.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Pain of the eye
- Photophobia
- Lacrimation
- Sticky discharge

---

## üè• Western Medicine Correlation

**Modern Diagnosis:**
- Acute conjunctivitis
- Pseudomembranous conjunctivitis
- Epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis

---

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Exogenous pathogenic [[wind]] heat causing obstruction of qi circulation in the meridians
2. Preponderance of [[fire]] in the liver and gallbladder which flares up along the related meridians

### Pathological Mechanism
This condition is mostly due to exogenous pathogenic [[wind]] heat causing obstruction of qi circulation in the meridians, or due to preponderance of [[fire]] in the liver and gallbladder which flares up along the related meridians, causing qi stagnation and blood stasis in the meridians.

**Affected Organs:** Liver, Gallbladder

---

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: [[Wind]] Heat Attacking the Eye

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Congestion of the eye
- Swelling of the eye
- Pain of the eye
- Photophobia
- Lacrimation
- Sticky discharge
- Fever

**Tongue:** Not specified in the provided text.
**Pulse:** Superficial and rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
When the pathogenic wind heat attacks the eye, congestion, swelling and pain of the eye, photophobia, lacrimation and sticky discharge take place. Headache, fever and superficial-rapid pulse are also signs of exogenous attack of the pathogenic wind heat.

---

### Pattern 2: Liver and Gallbladder [[Fire]] Flaring Up

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Congestion of the eye
- Swelling of the eye
- Pain of the eye
- Photophobia
- Lacrimation
- Sticky discharge
- Bitter taste in the mouth
- Irritability with feverish sensation
- Constipation

**Tongue:** Not specified in the provided text.
**Pulse:** String-taut pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Upward disturbance of fire in the liver and gallbladder may bring about congestion, swelling and pain of the eye, bitter taste in the mouth, and irritability. String-taut pulse is a sign of the liver trouble.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Wind Heat Attacking the Eye

**Treatment Principle:** Distal and local points are used in combination to disperse wind heat.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Jingming (B 1)]] | disperse the local accumulated heat |
| [[Fengchi (G 20)]] | regulate the qi circulation of the Yangming and Shaoyang Meridians in order to dispel wind and heat |
| [[Taiyang (Extra)]] | pricked to bleed to reduce heat and relieve swelling |
| [[Hegu (L I 4)]] | regulate the qi circulation of the Yangming and Shaoyang Meridians in order to dispel wind and heat |
| [[Xingjian (Liv 2)]] | conduct the qi of the Jueying Meridian downward so as to remove the heat from the liver |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Wind heat:**
- [[Waiguan (S J 5)]]

#### Explanation
The liver has its specific body opening in the eyes; Shaoyang, Yangming and Taiyang Meridians all run up to the eye region. Therefore Fengchi (G 20) and Hegu (L I 4) are used to regulate the qi circulation of the Yangming and Shaoyang Meridians in order to dispel wind and heat. Jingming (B 1) is where the Taiyang and Yangming Meridians meet, and is used to disperse the local accumulated heat. Xingjian (Liv 2), the Ying-(Spring) Point of the Liver Meridian, can conduct the qi of the Jueying Meridian downward so as to remove the heat from the liver. Taiyang (Extra), an adjacent point to the eye region, is pricked to bleed to reduce heat and relieve swelling. In case of wind heat, Waiguan (S J 5) is used to clear it away from the head and eyes.

### Pattern: Liver and Gallbladder Fire Flaring Up

**Treatment Principle:** Distal and local points are used in combination to disperse wind heat.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Jingming (B 1)]] | disperse the local accumulated heat |
| [[Fengchi (G 20)]] | regulate the qi circulation of the Yangming and Shaoyang Meridians in order to dispel wind and heat |
| [[Taiyang (Extra)]] | pricked to bleed to reduce heat and relieve swelling |
| [[Hegu (L I 4)]] | regulate the qi circulation of the Yangming and Shaoyang Meridians in order to dispel wind and heat |
| [[Xingjian (Liv 2)]] | conduct the qi of the Jueying Meridian downward so as to remove the heat from the liver |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Fire preponderance in the liver:**
- [[Taichong (Liv 3)]]

#### Explanation
The liver has its specific body opening in the eyes; Shaoyang, Yangming and Taiyang Meridians all run up to the eye region. Therefore Fengchi (G 20) and Hegu (L I 4) are used to regulate the qi circulation of the Yangming and Shaoyang Meridians in order to dispel wind and heat. Jingming (B 1) is where the Taiyang and Yangming Meridians meet, and is used to disperse the local accumulated heat. Xingjian (Liv 2), the Ying-(Spring) Point of the Liver Meridian, can conduct the qi of the Jueying Meridian downward so as to remove the heat from the liver. Taiyang (Extra), an adjacent point to the eye region, is pricked to bleed to reduce heat and relieve swelling. Taichong (Liv 3), the Yuan-(Primary) Point of the Liver Meridian, is selected to clear off the fire from the liver and gallbladder.
