# ü©∫ Boil and "Red-Thread Boil"

## üìñ Overview

Boils are localized skin lesions that frequently appear on the face, head, and extremities, varying in name and form based on their location. A distinctive manifestation, the "red-thread boil," is characterized by a red line extending outward from the lesion, indicating potential progression.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Frequently occurs on the face, head, and extremities
- Different names based on location and form (e.g., philtrum boil, snake-head boil)
- "Red-thread boil" features a red line extending proximally from the lesion
- Starts as a grain-sized lesion, yellow or purple, developing into a blister or pustula with a hard base
- Accompanied by tingling, then increased redness, swelling, burning pain
- Often associated with chills and fever
- Severe cases involve high fever, restlessness, dizziness, vomiting, and impaired consciousness

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Fatty and spicy food (leading to accumulation of heat in zang-fu organs and endogenous toxicity)
2. Contamination of the skin (resulting in invasion of exogenous toxic factor and stagnation of qi and blood)

### Pathological Mechanism
Fatty and spicy foods lead to endogenous toxicity, while skin contamination introduces exogenous toxic factors, causing stagnation of qi and blood. Toxic heat accumulates in the skin and muscles, then drops into the meridians, forming a swollen induration. Continued accumulation aggravates redness, swelling, and burning pain. If toxicity and heat travel along vessels, a red thread-like line extends proximally. In severe cases, pathogenic heat and toxicity invade the pericardium, leading to serious systemic symptoms. Transmission of pathogenic toxic factors into the meridians and zang-fu organs is considered dangerous.

**Affected Organs:** Zang-fu organs, Skin, Muscles, Meridians, Pericardium

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Toxic Heat Accumulation

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Boil appearing like a grain of millet (yellow or purple) on the head, face, or extremity
- Blister or pustula with a hard base, usually accompanied by tingling
- Increased redness, swelling, and burning pain
- Often accompanied by chills and fever
- Sometimes a red thread-like line extending proximally
- If toxicity attacks the interior: high fever, restlessness, dizziness, vomiting, impaired consciousness

**Tongue:** Reddened tongue with yellow coating
**Pulse:** Rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
When toxic heat stays in the skin and muscles and drops into the meridians, it results in stagnation of qi and blood, forming a swollen induration. Mild tingling indicates less severe stagnation. Further accumulation of heat and toxicity causes aggravation of redness, swelling, and burning pain. Chills and fever signify pathogenic factors in the exterior. Toxicity and heat traveling along vessels create the red thread-like line. High fever, restlessness, and impaired consciousness are due to the invasion of pathogenic heat and toxicity into the pericardium. Reddened tongue with yellow coating and rapid pulse are definitive signs of toxic heat.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Toxic Heat Accumulation

**Treatment Principle:** Clear Heat, Resolve Toxicity, Disperse Exogenous Pathogenic Factors, Regulate Yang Meridians, Cool Blood, Stop Pain.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing Method Or Pricking With A Three-Edged Needle To Cause Bleeding. For Red-Thread Boil, Prick With A Three-Edged Needle To Cause Bleeding At Two-Inch Intervals Along The Red Line Proximally Towards The Focus.

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Lingtai ([[DU-10]])]] | empirical point for the treatment of boil |
| [[Shenzhu ([[DU-12]])]] | readjusts the qi of all the yang meridians in order to disperse heat |
| [[Ximen ([[P-4]])]] | the Xi-(Cleft) Point of the Pericardium Meridian, effective for eliminating heat in the blood and stopping pain |
| [[Hegu (L I 4)]] | removing the exogenous pathogenic factors from the exterior of the body |
| [[Weizhong (B 40)]] | effective for clearing away toxin from the blood |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Boil on the face:**
- [[Shangyang (L I 1)]]
- [[Quchi (L I 11)]]

**For On the tip of fingers:**
- [[Quchi (L I 11)]]
- [[Yingxiang (L I 20)]]

**For On temporal region:**
- [[Yanglingquan (G 34)]]
- [[Zuqiaoyin (G 44)]]

**For On the fourth or fifth toe:**
- [[Yanglingquan (G 34)]]
- [[Tinghui (G 2)]]

#### Explanation
Points are selected to clear heat, resolve toxicity, dispel exogenous pathogenic factors, regulate qi of yang meridians, and stop pain, targeting both the superficial manifestation and potential internal spread of toxic heat. Specific points like Lingtai ([[DU-10]]) are empirical for boils, while others like Shenzhu ([[DU-12]]) disperse heat, Ximen ([[P-4]]) cools blood and stops pain, Hegu (L I 4) expels external pathogens, and Weizhong (B 40) clears blood toxins. Supplementary points are chosen based on the boil's location to enhance local and meridian-specific effects.

## üìä Prognosis

The prognosis can be dangerous if the pathogenic toxic factor is transmitted into the meridians and the zang-fu organs, indicating a potentially severe and complicated course if not promptly managed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Clinical Remarks

Boils are categorized by location and form, such as 'philtrum boil,' 'snake-head boil,' and 'red-thread boil.' The explanation for the collective action of the primary points is incomplete in the provided text.
