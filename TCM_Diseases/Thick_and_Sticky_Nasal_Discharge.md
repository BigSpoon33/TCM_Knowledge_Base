# ü©∫ Thick and Sticky Nasal Discharge

## üìñ Overview

This condition is characterized by thick and sticky nasal discharge, accompanied by nasal obstruction and loss of the sense of smell. It is primarily caused by pathogenic factors affecting the lung.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Nasal obstruction
- Loss of the sense of smell
- Yellow fetid nasal discharge
- Thick and sticky nasal discharge

## üè• Western Medicine Correlation

**Modern Diagnosis:**
- chronic rhinitis
- chronic nasosinusitis

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Attack of pathogenic factors on the lung
2. Exogenous [[wind]] [[cold]] transforming into heat
3. Direct attack by [[wind]] heat

### Pathological Mechanism
The condition arises from pathogenic factors, such as exogenous [[wind]] [[cold]] transforming into heat or direct attack by wind heat, affecting the lung. This leads to dysfunction of the lung and invasion of the pathogenic factors upon the nose through the upper respiratory tract.

**Affected Organs:** Lung, Nose, Stomach

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Pathogenic Heat Accumulated in the Lung

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Nasal obstruction
- loss of the sense of smell
- yellow fetid nasal discharge
- thick and sticky nasal discharge
- cough
- dull pain in the forehead

**Tongue:** Reddened tongue with thin, white and sticky coating
**Pulse:** Rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Pathogenic heat accumulated in the lung impedes the descending of the lung qi, then pathogenic heat rushes up to the nose, causing nasal obstruction. Pathogenic heat consumes the body fluid and changes it into phlegm and mucus, so there is turbid and fetid nasal discharge. Cough results from adverse flow of the lung qi. When extreme heat in the lung and stomach further disturbs the upper orifices, pain with distension occurs in the forehead. Reddened tongue and rapid pulse are signs of pathogenic heat in the lung.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Pathogenic Heat Accumulated in the Lung

**Treatment Principle:** Points of the Hand-Taiyin and Hand-Yangming Meridians are selected as the principal points to smooth the flow of the lung qi and expel pathogenic wind heat by applying the reducing method.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[LU-7]] | smoothes the flow of the lung qi and eliminates the pathogenic wind |
| [[L I 20]] | regulate the qi circulation in the Hand-Yangming Meridian and to clear away the heat from the lung |
| [[Bitong (Extra)]] | removing the obstruction and eliminating heat from the nose |
| [[L I 4]] | regulate the qi circulation in the Hand-Yangming Meridian and to clear away the heat from the lung |
| [[Yintang (Extra)]] | removing the obstruction and eliminating heat from the nose |

#### Explanation
Lieque (L 7) smoothes the flow of the lung qi and eliminates the pathogenic wind. The Hand-Yangming Meridian is exteriorly-interiorly related to the Hand-Taiyin Meridian, and travels by the sides of nose. So Hegu (L I 4) and Yingxiang (L I 20) are selected to regulate the qi circulation in the Hand-Yangming Meridian and to clear away the heat from the lung. Yintang (Extra) is close to the nose, and Bitong (Extra) is located at the sides of the nose. Both have the action of removing the obstruction and eliminating heat from the nose.
