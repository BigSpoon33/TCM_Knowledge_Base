# ü©∫ Intestinal Abscess

## üìñ Overview

Intestinal abscess is an acute abdominal disorder occurring in the intestines, characterized by localized pain. It can be classified into large-intestinal abscess (pain around S 25) and small-intestinal abscess (pain around Ren 4). A common distinguishing feature is the limitation of right leg extension.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Acute abdominal disorder
- Paroxysmal pain in upper abdomen or around umbilicus, localizing to right lower abdomen near Tianshu (S 25)
- Tenderness and mild contracture of the abdominal wall
- Difficulty in extension of the right leg
- Fever, chills
- Nausea, vomiting, constipation

---

## üè• Western Medicine Correlation

**Modern Diagnosis:**
- Acute simple appendicitis
- Appendicial abscess (requires other therapeutic measures)
- Chronic appendicitis

---

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Irregular intake of food
2. Retention of undigested food
3. Undue [[cold]] and warmth
4. Running after a big meal

### Pathological Mechanism
Irregular food intake, retention of undigested food, undue [[cold]]/warmth, or running after a big meal can lead to dysfunction of the intestines in transmission. This results in the accumulation of [[damp]] heat and stagnation of qi and blood, which in combination will lead to suppuration and abscess formation. This obstruction of the stomach and intestines pathway causes localized abdominal pain and tenderness. Imbalance between nutrient qi and defensive qi, and confrontation between pathogenic factors and body resistance, result in fever and chills. Failure of stomach qi to descend causes nausea and vomiting.

**Affected Organs:** Intestines (Large intestine, Small intestine, Appendix), Stomach

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: [[Damp]] Heat and Qi-Blood Stagnation in Intestines

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Sudden paroxysmal pain in the upper abdomen or around the umbilicus, soon becoming continuous and localized in the right lower abdomen near Tianshu (S 25)
- Tenderness
- Mild contracture of the abdominal wall
- Difficulty in extension of the right leg
- Fever
- Chills
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Constipation
- Dark urine
- Severe pain with contracture of the abdominal wall, marked tenderness or palpable mass (in serious cases)
- High fever and spontaneous sweating (in serious cases)

**Tongue:** Thin, sticky and yellow tongue coating
**Pulse:** Rapid and forceful pulse (forceful and rapid pulse in serious cases)

#### TCM Analysis
Intestinal abscess is due to accumulation of [[damp]] heat and stagnation of qi and blood that obstructs the pathway of the stomach and intestines, leading to localized abdominal pain and tenderness. It mostly occurs in the appendix, causing severe pain in the right lower abdomen. Stagnation of qi and blood, imbalance between the nutrient qi and defensive qi, and confrontation between pathogenic factors and body resistance result in fever and chills. When the stomach qi fails to descend, there are nausea and vomiting. The yellow-sticky tongue coating and rapid, forceful pulse indicate an excess syndrome caused by accumulation of damp heat in the stomach and intestines. Sharp pain with contracture of the abdominal wall, tenderness, local mass, high fever, spontaneous sweating, and rapid forceful pulse indicate suppuration with collection of pus and extreme heat in the Yangming Meridians, a serious condition.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Damp Heat and Qi-Blood Stagnation in Intestines

**Treatment Principle:** To disperse damp heat, regulate qi circulation and stop pain by reducing method.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing Method; Needles Are Retained For A Long Time From Thirty To One Hundred Twenty Minutes. Manipulation Is Given Every Ten Minutes, And Treat Every Six To Eight Hours. When The Symptoms And Signs Are Alleviated, Treatment Should Be Given Once Daily With Needles Retained For Thirty Minutes.

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[ST-25]] | Front-(Mu) Point of the large intestine, used to remove accumulation of damp heat from the intestines and to promote qi circulation and stop pain |
| [[L I 11]] | He-(Sea) Point of the Large Intestine Meridian, used to eliminate heat from the intestines |
| [[Lanwei (Extra)]] | Empirical point in treating the intestinal abscess |
| [[ST-37]] | Lower He-(Sea) Point of the large intestine, used to remove accumulation of damp heat from the intestines and to promote qi circulation and stop pain |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Fever:**
- [[DU-14]]
- [[L I 4]]

**For Vomiting:**
- [[P-6]]
- [[REN-12]]

#### Explanation
Lanwei (Extra) is an empirical point in treating the intestinal abscess. Shangjuxu (S 37), the lower He-(Sea) Point of the large intestine, together with Tianshu (S 25), the Front-(Mu) Point of the large intestine, are used to remove accumulation of damp heat from the intestines and to promote qi circulation and stop pain. Quchi (L I 11), the He-(Sea) Point of the Large Intestine Meridian, is used to eliminate heat from the intestines. Dazhui (Du 14) and Hegu (L I 4) are used to strengthen the antipyretic action. Neiguan (P 6) and Zhongwan (Ren 12) are used to harmonize the stomach and stop vomiting.

## üìä Prognosis

Acupuncture treatment is considered effective for acute simple appendicitis. However, if there is an appendicial abscess or a tendency to perforate, other therapeutic measures should be resorted to, indicating a more guarded prognosis in such serious cases.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention & Prophylaxis

Prevention involves maintaining regular dietary habits, avoiding the retention of undigested food, protecting against undue [[cold]] and warmth, and refraining from strenuous activity (e.g., running) immediately after a big meal to prevent dysfunction of the intestines and accumulation of damp heat.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Clinical Remarks

Intestinal abscess is chiefly referred to as acute simple appendicitis in modern medicine, for which acupuncture treatment is considered effective. If there is appendicial abscess or tendency to perforate, other therapeutic measures should be resorted to. For chronic appendicitis, the mentioned points may also be used, with acupuncture given once a day or every other day, and moxibustion potentially applied locally at the same time.
