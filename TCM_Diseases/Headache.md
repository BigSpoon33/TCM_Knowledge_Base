## ðŸ§¬ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Invasion of pathogenic [[wind]] into the upper meridians and collaterals
2. Upsurge of liver yang due to stagnation of qi or injury of the liver after a fit of anger
3. Deficiency of both qi and blood due to irregular food intake, overstrain and stress, poor health with a chronic disease, or congenital deficiency

### Pathological Mechanism
The head is the meeting place for all yang meridians of hand and foot, and receives qi and blood from the five zang organs and six fu organs. Attacks from endogenous or exogenous factors can cause headache due to derangement of qi and blood in the head and retardation of qi circulation in the meridians traversing the head. Exogenous factors primarily involve invasion of pathogenic [[wind]] into the meridians and collaterals, while endogenous factors often originate from hyperfunction of the liver yang, or deficiency of both qi and blood. Specifically, invasion of pathogenic [[wind]] causes derangement and obstruction of qi and blood with stagnation in the collaterals; upsurge of liver yang occurs in patients with excessive yang constitution after anger, damaging yin; deficiency of qi prevents clear yang from ascending, and deficiency of blood fails to nourish the mind.

**Affected Organs:** Liver
