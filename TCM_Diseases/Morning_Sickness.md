## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Deficiency of stomach qi
2. Upward flux of the fetal qi invading the stomach
3. Perversive flow of stomach qi
4. Constant deficiency of the stomach qi
5. Cessation of menstruation after pregnancy
6. Hyperfunction of the Chong Meridian
7. Insufficient liver blood
8. Hyperactivity of liver yang accompanied by weakened spleen and stomach

### Pathological Mechanism
It is caused by constant deficiency of the stomach qi, cessation of menstruation after pregnancy and hyperfunction of the Chong Meridian, which further affect the Yangming Meridian, leading to perversive flowing of the feeble stomach qi together with the qi in the Chong Meridian, hence nausea and vomiting. In some cases, when the blood flows to nurture the fetus there results in insufficient liver blood and hyperactivity of liver yang accompanied by weakened spleen and stomach, leading to nausea and vomiting.

**Affected Organs:** Stomach, Spleen, Liver, Chong Meridian, Yangming Meridian

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Deficiency in the Spleen and Stomach

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Nausea and vomiting of liquid or indigested food immediately after meals
- Fullness and distending feeling in the chest
- Lassitude and sleepiness

**Tongue:** Pale tongue with white coating
**Pulse:** Slippery and weak pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Blood centred in the lower abdomen after pregnancy, the qi of the Chong Meridian gushes upward and the stomach qi is unable to descend due to the weakened spleen and stomach. The stomach qi does not go downward, instead, upward with the qi of the Chong Meridian, causing nausea, anorexia and vomiting right after intake of food. Weakened spleen and stomach leads to the insufficiency of yang qi in the middle jiao, manifested by fullness and distension in the epigastrium, lassitude and sleepiness, and vomiting of liquid. Pale tongue with white coating and weak slippery pulse are signs of deficiency in the spleen and stomach after pregnancy.

### Pattern 2: Disharmony Between the Liver and Stomach

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Vomiting of bitter or sour liquid
- Epigastric fullness and hyperchondriac pain
- Frequent belching and sighing
- Mental depression
- Dizziness and eye distension

**Tongue:** Yellowish tongue coating
**Pulse:** String-taut slippery pulse

#### TCM Analysis
The stagnated liver qi travels adversely along the Liver Meridian via the stomach to diaphragm, hypochondrium and chest, which causes nausea, vomiting, epigastric fullness, distending pain in the chest and hypochondrium, frequent belching and mental depression. Dizziness and eye distension are consequence of the upward influx of the liver qi. The liver and gallbladder are interiorly-exteriorly related. When there is internal liver heat [[fire]] of the gallbladder discharges, resulting in vomiting of bitter or sour liquid. Yellowish coating and string-taut slippery pulse are signs of disharmony between the liver and stomach.
