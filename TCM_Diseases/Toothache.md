## üè• Western Medicine Correlation

**Modern Diagnosis:**
- acute pulpitis
- chronic pulpitis
- dental caries
- peridental abscess
- pericoronitis

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Pathogenic fire transformed from pathogenic heat in the large intestine and stomach flaring up along meridians
2. Exogenous pathogenic [[wind]] attacking and accumulating in the Yangming Meridians
3. Deficiency of the kidney yin with flaring up of asthenic fire
4. Dental caries caused by overintake of sour and sweet food

### Pathological Mechanism
The Hand and Foot Yangming Meridians go into the upper and lower gums respectively. Toothache may be due to flaring up along the meridians of the pathogenic fire transformed from pathogenic heat in the large intestine and stomach, or from exogenous pathogenic [[wind]] that attacks and accumulates in the Yangming Meridians. The kidney controls bones and the teeth are the odds and ends of the bones. Deficiency of the kidney yin with flaring up of the asthenic fire may also give rise to toothache. Sometimes toothache is due to dental caries caused by overintake of sour and sweet food.

**Affected Organs:** Large Intestine, Stomach, Kidney, Gums, Teeth

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Toothache due to stomach fire

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Severe toothache
- foul breath
- thirst
- constipation
- yellow tongue coating

**Tongue:** yellow tongue coating
**Pulse:** forceful and rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Accumulated heat in the stomach and intestines results in constipation. Upsurging of the stomach heat causes yellow tongue coating and foul breath. Thirst is due to the exhaustion of body fluid by heat. Severe toothache is due to the stomach heat flaring up along the meridians. Forceful and rapid pulse also indicates the stomach fire.

---

### Pattern 2: Toothache caused by wind fire

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Acute toothache
- gingival swelling
- chills and fever

**Pulse:** superficial and rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
The exogenous pathogenic wind invades the Yangming Meridians and turns into fire. Then occurs the toothache with gingival swelling. When the exogenous pathogenic factors struggle against the body resistance in the muscles and skins, there are chills and fever as exterior symptoms. Superficial and rapid pulse is a sign of wind-fire.

---

### Pattern 3: Toothache caused by deficiency of the kidney yin

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Dull pain off and on
- loose teeth
- absence of foul breath
- reddened tongue

**Tongue:** reddened tongue
**Pulse:** thready and rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
The kidney controls bones and the teeth are the odds and ends of the bones. The kidney in deficiency state fails to keep the teeth strong, so they are loose. Flaring up of the asthenic fire leads to dull pain. Since nothing is accumulated in the stomach, there is no foul breath. Thready, rapid pulse and reddened tongue are due to heat caused by yin deficiency.

| [[Taixi (K 3)]] | nourish yin of the kidney and lower the asthenic fire |

#### Explanation
The teeth relate to the kidney and are situated at the place where the Stomach Meridian and Large Intestine Meridian go through. Thus Taixi (K 3) is used to nourish yin of the kidney and lower the asthenic fire. Jiache (S 6) and Xiaguan (S 7) relieve pain by regulating the qi in the meridians.
