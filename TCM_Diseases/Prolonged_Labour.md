# ü©∫ Prolonged Labour

## üìñ Overview

Prolonged labour is defined as parturition lasting over twenty-four hours. It is often caused by weak or forceless contraction of the womb, or underlying issues such as a narrow pelvis or malposition of the fetus.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Parturition lasting over twenty-four hours
- Weak or forceless uterine contraction

---

## üè• Western Medicine Correlation

**Modern Diagnosis:**
- Uterine deformity
- Contracted pelvis
- Malposition of fetus

---

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Deficiency of qi and blood (weak constitution, insufficient qi, exhaustion from premature contraction, premature amniorrhea, depletion of blood due to hemorrhage)
2. Qi stagnation and blood stasis (fear or worry, extreme leisure during gestation, affection by external [[cold]] during delivery)

### Pathological Mechanism
Deficiency of qi and blood leads to a lack of driving force for uterine contraction, resulting in prolonged labour. Qi stagnation and blood stasis, often stemming from emotional factors, lack of activity, or external [[cold]], impede the smooth flow of qi and blood, causing pain and delaying the birthing process by obstructing the descent of the fetus.

**Affected Organs:** Uterus, Spleen, Heart, Liver

---

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Deficiency of qi and blood

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Dull and paroxysmal labour pains with mild weighing and distending sensation
- Profuse hemorrhage in light colour
- Pale complexion
- Lassitude
- Palpitation
- Shortness of breath

**Tongue:** Pale tongue
**Pulse:** Weak pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Since both qi and blood are deficient and the puerperant is too weak to have uterus contraction, there are mild abdominal pain, mild heavy and distending sensation, and the delivery duration is prolonged. Qi deficiency leads to profuse hemorrhage in light colour, pale complexion, lassitude, palpitation, and shortness of breath. Pale tongue and weak pulse are signs of deficiency of qi and blood.

---

### Pattern 2: Qi stagnation and blood stasis

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Sharp pains in the waist and abdomen
- Scanty hemorrhage in dark red colour
- Prolonged delivery course
- Dark bluish complexion
- Depressive mood
- Fullness in the chest and epigastrium
- Frequent nausea

**Tongue:** Dark tongue
**Pulse:** Deep forceful pulse

#### TCM Analysis
The retarded circulation of qi and blood gives rise to the sharp pain in the waist and abdomen and prolonged course of delivery. The stagnated qi does not ascend as usual, bringing about the dark bluish complexion, fullness and distension in the chest and epigastrium, and frequent nausea. The dark tongue, deep and forceful pulse indicate qi stagnation and blood stasis.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Deficiency of qi and blood

**Treatment Principle:** Tonify qi and blood, and quicken the delivery.

**Needle Technique:** Reinforcing Method With Moxibustion

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[ST-36]] | generate qi and blood and tonify the spleen and stomach |
| [[SP-6]] | generate qi and blood and tonify the spleen and stomach |
| [[BL-67]] | an effective and empirical oxytocic point |

#### Explanation
Zusanli (S 36) and Sanyinjiao (Sp 6) may generate qi and blood and tonify the spleen and stomach, while Zhiyin (B 67) is an effective and empirical oxytocic point. The three points thus used together fulfil the set purpose of tonifying qi and blood and quickening the delivery.

---

### Pattern: Qi stagnation and blood stasis

**Treatment Principle:** Regulate qi and blood, activate qi so as to quicken the delivery.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing Method

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[L I 4]] | Yuan-(Primary) Point of the Hand-Yangming Meridian, may regulate qi and blood, clear off stasis and speed up the delivery |
| [[SP-6]] | an intersecting point of the three foot yin meridians, may regulate qi and blood, clear off stasis and speed up the delivery |
| [[BL-67]] | an effective and empirical oxytocic point |

#### Explanation
Hegu (L I 4) is the Yuan-(Primary) Point of the Hand-Yangming Meridian and Sanyinjiao (Sp 6) is an intersecting point of the three foot yin meridians. The two paired together may regulate qi and blood, clear off stasis and speed up the delivery. Zhiyin (B 67) is an effective and empirical oxytocic point.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Clinical Remarks

Acupuncture and moxibustion carry an oxytocic effect for prolonged labour due to weak uterine contraction. However, measures other than acupuncture and moxibustion should be taken if prolonged labour is caused by uterine deformity or contracted pelvis. The Appendix also details the use of moxibustion on Zhiyin (B 67) bilaterally for fetal malposition, reporting a success rate over 80%, particularly effective in multiparae.
