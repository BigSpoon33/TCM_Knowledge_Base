# ü©∫ Urticaria

## üìñ Overview

Urticaria is commonly seen in clinic. It is an eruption of the skin characterized by transitory, flat-topped wheals which look like measles or are as large as broad beans. It is apt to appear after exposure to [[wind]], so traditional Chinese medicine terms it '[[wind]] wheal.' Because it comes and goes, it is also named 'hidden rash.'

**Key Characteristics:**
- Transitory, flat-topped wheals
- Wheals look like measles or are as large as broad beans
- Apt to appear after exposure to [[wind]]
- Comes and goes ('hidden rash')
- May repeatedly occur and not be cured for months or years

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Stagnation of dampness in the skin and muscles, which are again attacked by wind heat or wind [[cold]].
2. Accumulated heat in the stomach and intestines with further attack of pathogenic wind which could neither be dispersed from the interior nor removed from the exterior.
3. Intestinal parasitosis (e.g., ascariasis, ancylostomiasis, fasciolopsis), or intake of fish, shrimp or crab leading to dysharmony of the spleen and stomach with accumulation of [[damp]] heat in the skin and muscles.

### Pathological Mechanism
The confrontation against dampness is going on between the skin and muscles, leading to wind wheals. Pathogenic wind heat stays between the skin and muscles, resulting in wind wheals. Dysharmony of the spleen and stomach leads to accumulation of [[damp]] heat in the skin and muscles.

**Affected Organs:** Skin, Muscles, Stomach, Intestines, Spleen

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Wind heat

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Red rashes with severe itching

**Pulse:** superficial and rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Red colour indicates heat; itching is caused by wind. Superficial and rapid pulse is a sign of wind heat.

---

### Pattern 2: Wind [[damp]]

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- White or light red rashes accompanied by heaviness of the body

**Tongue:** white and sticky tongue coating
**Pulse:** superficial and slow pulse

#### TCM Analysis
White or light red rashes and heaviness of the body indicate stagnation of wind damp in the skin and muscles. White sticky tongue coating and superficial slow pulse are signs of wind damp.

---

### Pattern 3: Accumulation of heat in the stomach and intestines

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Red rashes complicated by abdominal or epigastric pain
- constipation or diarrhoea

**Tongue:** thin yellow tongue coating
**Pulse:** rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Red colour shows heat. Epigastric and abdominal pain with constipation suggests accumulated heat in the stomach and intestines, which causes the obstruction of qi in the fu organs. Rapid pulse and yellow tongue coating indicate existence of interior heat.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Wind heat

**Treatment Principle:** Disperse wind damp and eliminate heat in the blood. Select points of the Spleen and Large Intestine Meridians as principal points.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Quchi (LI 11)]] | disperse pathogenic factors from the skin and muscles |
| [[Hegu (LI 4)]] | disperse pathogenic factors from the skin and muscles |
| [[Weizhong (B 40)]] | eliminate heat in the blood |
| [[Xuehai (Sp 10)]] | eliminate heat in the blood |
| [[Sanyinjiao (Sp 6)]] | remove dampness |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Wind heat:**
- [[Dazhui (Du 14)]]

#### Explanation
Wind rash is mainly caused by stagnation of the pathogenic wind, heat or damp in the skin and muscles or due to accumulated damp heat in the stomach and intestine, so points Quchi (LI 11) and Hegu (LI 4) of Hand-Yangming Meridian are used to disperse the pathogenic factors from the skin and muscles. Xuehai (Sp 10) and Weizhong (B 40) are combined with the former points to eliminate heat in the blood, Sanyinjiao (Sp 6) is to remove dampness. Dazhui (Du 14), the point where all the yang meridian meet, is used to reduce heat.

#### Supplementary Points

**For Wind damp:**
- [[Yinlingquan (Sp 9)]]

#### Explanation
Wind rash is mainly caused by stagnation of the pathogenic wind, heat or damp in the skin and muscles or due to accumulated damp heat in the stomach and intestine, so points Quchi (LI 11) and Hegu (LI 4) of Hand-Yangming Meridian are used to disperse the pathogenic factors from the skin and muscles. Xuehai (Sp 10) and Weizhong (B 40) are combined with the former points to eliminate heat in the blood, Sanyinjiao (Sp 6) is to remove dampness. Yinlingquan (Sp 9) removes damp.

| [[Xuehai (Sp 10)]] | eliminate heat in the blood |
| [[Sanyinjiao (Sp 6)]] | remove dampness |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Accumulated heat in the stomach and intestine:**
- [[Tianshu (S 25)]]
- [[Zusanli (S 36)]]

#### Explanation
Wind rash is mainly caused by stagnation of the pathogenic wind, heat or damp in the skin and muscles or due to accumulated damp heat in the stomach and intestine, so points Quchi (LI 11) and Hegu (LI 4) of Hand-Yangming Meridian are used to disperse the pathogenic factors from the skin and muscles. Xuehai (Sp 10) and Weizhong (B 40) are combined with the former points to eliminate heat in the blood, Sanyinjiao (Sp 6) is to remove dampness. The reducing method applied to Tianshu (S 25) and Zusanli (S 36) is to dredge the accumulated heat from the stomach and intestines.

## üìä Prognosis

Acute conditions subside quickly. In some cases it may repeatedly occur and have not been cured for months or years.
