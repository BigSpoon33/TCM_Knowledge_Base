# ü©∫ Sore Throat

## üìñ Overview

Sore throat is a commonly encountered condition in TCM, broadly categorized into two types: excess and deficiency. It involves either exogenous pathogenic factors leading to heat accumulation or internal imbalances stemming from yin deficiency and flaring asthenic [[fire]], affecting the throat and related organ systems.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Abrupt or gradual onset
- Presence or absence of fever/chills
- Congested or dry throat
- Pain during swallowing
- Thirst or [[dryness]]
- Feverish sensation in palms and soles

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Exogenous pathogenic [[wind]] heat scorching the lung system (Excess type)
2. Accumulated heat in the Lung and Stomach Meridians disturbing upward (Excess type)
3. Exhaustion of kidney yin failing to moisten the throat (Deficiency type)
4. Asthenic [[fire]] flaring up due to yin deficiency (Deficiency type)

### Pathological Mechanism
The throat has connections with both the stomach (via the esophagus) and the lung (via the trachea). Sore throat of the excess type typically arises from external [[wind]]-heat invading the Lung system, or from existing heat accumulated in the Lung and Stomach Meridians ascending to the throat. For the deficiency type, the underlying cause is often the exhaustion of kidney yin, which consequently fails to ascend and adequately moisten the throat, leading to an upward flaring of asthenic [[fire]].

**Affected Organs:** Lung, Stomach, Kidney, Large Intestine

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Syndrome of excess of heat

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Abrupt onset with chills
- fever
- headache
- congested and sore throat
- thirst
- dysphagia
- constipation

**Tongue:** reddened tongue with thin yellow coating
**Pulse:** superficial and rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Exogenous pathogenic [[wind]] heat invades the exterior portion of the body, leading to chills, fever and headache. After having been transmitted to the lung system the pathogenic wind heat causes sore throat and dysphagia. The lung is exteriorly-interiorly related with the large intestine. Since the pathogenic heat consumes the body fluid, there are symptoms of thirst and constipation. Reddened tongue with thin yellow coating, superficial and rapid pulse are signs of the pathogenic wind heat invading the lung.

### Pattern 2: Syndrome of deficiency of yin

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Gradual onset without fever or with low fever
- slightly congested throat with intermittent pain or pain during swallowing
- [[dryness]] of the throat, more marked at night
- feverish sensation in the palms and soles

**Tongue:** reddened and furless tongue
**Pulse:** thready and rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
The Kidney Meridian of Foot-Shaoyin travels to the throat. Because the kidney yin is insufficient to run up to moisten the throat, the throat is slightly congested with mild pain on and off and with [[dryness]] more marked at night. Feverish sensation in the palms and soles, reddened and furless tongue, thready and rapid pulse are signs of deficiency of yin that causes yang preponderance.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Syndrome of excess of heat

**Treatment Principle:** To disperse wind and eliminate heat by puncturing the points of Hand-Taiyin and Foot-Yangming Meridians

**Needle Technique:** Reducing

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Shaoshang (L 11)]] | used to clear off the heat from the lung and relieve pain |
| [[Hegu (L I 4)]] | disperses exterior pathogenic factors from the Lung Meridian and the accumulated heat from the Yangming Meridians |
| [[Neiting (S 44)]] | reduces heat in the stomach |
| [[Tianrong (S I 17)]] | a local point used to ease the pain of a sore throat |

#### Explanation
Pricking Shaoshang (L 11) to let a few drops of blood out is used to clear off the heat from the lung and relieve pain. Hegu (L I 4) disperses exterior pathogenic factors from the Lung Meridian and the accumulated heat from the Yangming Meridians. Neiting (S 44), the Ying-(Spring) Point of the Stomach Meridian, reduces heat in the stomach. Tianrong (S I 17) is a local point used to ease the pain of a sore throat.

### Pattern: Syndrome of deficiency of yin

**Treatment Principle:** To nourish yin and descend fire by puncturing with the reinforcing method at points of Shaoyin Meridians of Hand and Foot as the principal points

**Needle Technique:** Reinforcing

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Taixi (K 3)]] | is the Yuan-(Primary) Point of the Kidney Meridian which runs up to the throat |
| [[Yuji (L 10)]] | is the Ying-(Spring) Point of the Lung Meridian |
| [[Lianquan (Ren 23)]] | Not explained in the text. |
| [[Zhaohai (K 6)]] | one of a pair of the Eight Confluent points (with Lieque). Function not fully described in text due to truncation. |
| [[Lieque (L 7)]] | one of a pair of the Eight Confluent points (with Zhaohai). Function not fully described in text due to truncation. |
| [[Futu (L I 18)]] | Not explained in the text. |

#### Explanation
Taixi (K 3) is the Yuan-(Primary) Point of the Kidney Meridian which runs up to the throat. Yuji (L 10) is the Ying-(Spring) Point of the Lung Meridian. Combination of the two points nourishes yin and reduces the fire. Zhaohai (K 6) and Lieque (L 7), a pair of the Eight Confluent

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Clinical Remarks

For Syndrome of deficiency of yin, the two prescriptions (a) Taixi (K 3), Yuji (L 10), Lianquan (Ren 23) and (b) Zhaohai (K 6), Lieque (L 7), Futu (L I 18) may be used alternatively.
