# ü©∫ Infantile Paralysis

## üìñ Overview

Infantile paralysis is in the range of "wei syndrome." What is stated here is the sequellae of poliomyelitis. The causative factor of this disease is the invasion of epidemic pathogenic factors, which injure the meridians.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Paralysis may occur in any part of the body, especially in the lower limb with weakness of the muscles and [[cold]] skin.
- Paralysis of the abdominal muscles is revealed by bulging of the abdomen during crying.
- In a chronic case there is muscular atrophy of the affected part with deformity of the trunk, and the paralysis is intractable.

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Invasion of epidemic pathogenic factors
2. Invasion of pathogenic [[wind]], dampness and heat

### Pathological Mechanism
This disease is mainly due to invasion of pathogenic [[wind]], dampness and heat. These epidemic pathogenic factors invading the lung and stomach through the mouth and nose, accumulate and turn into heat which gets into and obstructs the meridians. Consequently qi and blood fail to circulate normally to nourish tendons, vessels and muscles, hence there is paralysis of the limbs. Long-lasting illness will lead to deficiency of essence and blood and affect the liver and kidney, so the tendons and muscles are withered. This is the reason why in the later stage of this disease there are flaccidity of tendons, atrophy of muscles and deformity of bones.

**Affected Organs:** Lung, Stomach, Liver, Kidney

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Sequellae of Infantile Paralysis (Obstructive Wei Syndrome, Chronic Stage)

**Type:** Mixed

#### Main Manifestations
- Paralysis in any part of the body (especially lower limb)
- Weakness of muscles
- [[Cold]] skin
- Paralysis of abdominal muscles (revealed by bulging during crying)
- Muscular atrophy of affected part
- Deformity of trunk (in chronic case)
- Intractable paralysis

**Tongue:** Not mentioned in text
**Pulse:** Not mentioned in text

#### TCM Analysis
All the limbs and the skeleton of the human body rely on the nourishment of qi and blood that circulate in the meridians and collaterals. When the pathogenic factors attack the meridians and collaterals, ying (nutrient qi) and wei (defensive qi), qi and blood lose their normal flow, and tendons, vessels and muscles fail to be nourished. Therefore, the limb becomes paralytic and the skin [[cold]]. Long standing of the disease not only leads to muscular atrophy by impaired qi and blood supply, but also exhausts the essence and blood, and affects the liver and kidney. The liver dominates tendons while the kidney is in charge of bones, so the injury of the liver and kidney causes poor nourishment of the tendons and bones. As the result, the tendons become flaccid while the bones deformed, and the paralysis is intractable.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Sequellae of Infantile Paralysis (Obstructive Wei Syndrome, Chronic Stage)

**Treatment Principle:** Points of Hand and Foot Yangming Meridians are selected as the principal points to regulate the circulation of qi in the meridians so as to nourish the tendons and bones.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing/Reinforcing/Even/Moxibustion

#### Explanation
This prescription follows the principle in internal classic that "only select the points of Yangming Meridians for the treatment of paralysis." Yanglingquan (G 34), the Influential Point of tendons, and Xuanzhong (G 39), the Influential Point of bones, are used to enhance the function of nourishing the tendons and bones. Other points such as Dazhui (Du 14), Tianzhu (B 10), Waiguan (S J 5), Huantiao (G 30), Liangmen (S 21), Tianshu (S 25), Daimai (G 26), Sanyinjiao (Sp 9), Kunlun (B 60), are all local points to remove the obstruction of meridians for a smooth flow of qi. Huatuojiaji points, the extra points with the action of adjusting the functions of the zang-fu organs and removing the obstruction of meridians, are also used as the local points.
