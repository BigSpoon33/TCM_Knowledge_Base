# ü©∫ Uterine Bleeding

## üìñ Overview

Uterine Bleeding, also known as metrorrhagia, is defined as vaginal hemorrhage beyond the menstrual period, which can be either copious or continuously dripping. Profuse bleeding with a sudden onset is termed profuse metrorrhagia, while scanty bleeding with a gradual onset is continuous scanty uterine bleeding. Although different, these manifestations can intertransmute during the disease course, with chronic profuse bleeding consuming qi and blood to become scanty, and prolonged scanty bleeding potentially worsening into profuse bleeding.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Vaginal hemorrhage beyond menstrual period
- Can be copious (profuse metrorrhagia) or continuously dripping (continuous scanty uterine bleeding)
- Profuse bleeding typically has a sudden onset; scanty bleeding has a gradual onset
- Profuse and scanty bleeding are intertransmutable during the disease process
- Profuse bleeding is considered severe, while scanty bleeding is comparatively mild

## üè• Western Medicine Correlation

**Modern Diagnosis:**
- Functional uterine bleeding due to ovarian dysfunction

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Excessive heat (constant excess of yang, exposure to external pathogenic heat, indulgence in spicy food, disturbance of the seven emotions, exasperation hurting the liver)
2. Qi deficiency (worries, irregular intake of food, overstrain damaging spleen qi)

### Pathological Mechanism
Excessive internal heat, stemming from factors like constant excess of yang, external pathogenic heat, spicy food, emotional disturbances, or liver [[fire]] due to exasperation, injures the Chong and Ren Meridians, causing blood to escape its vessels. Alternatively, damage to spleen qi from worries, irregular diet, or overstrain weakens its ability to restrict blood, leading to instability in the Chong and Ren Meridians and subsequent metrorrhagia.

**Affected Organs:** Chong Meridian, Ren Meridian, Liver, Spleen, Heart

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Excessive heat

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Sudden onset of profuse or prolonged continuous vaginal bleeding in deep red colour
- Fidgets
- Insomnia
- Dizziness

**Tongue:** red tongue with yellow coating
**Pulse:** rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
The blood escape is due to excessive internal heat. When the heat disturbs the mind there present fidgets and insomnia. Dizziness is caused by the upward going of heat. Red tongue with yellow coating and rapid pulse are signs of heat in the blood.

### Pattern 2: Qi deficiency

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Sudden profuse bleeding or continuous scanty bleeding marked by light red and thin blood
- Lassitude
- Shortness of breath
- Apathy
- Anorexia

**Tongue:** pale tongue
**Pulse:** thready weak pulse

#### TCM Analysis
It is caused by the failure of the qi in control of blood and the disordered Chong and Ren Meridians. Lassitude, shortness of breath and apathy are manifestations of qi deficiency in the middle jiao. Anorexia derives from the dysfunction of the spleen in transportation and transformation. The light-coloured and thin blood is due to failure of blood to be warmed up. The pale tongue and thready weak pulse are signs of deficiency of qi and blood.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Excessive heat

**Treatment Principle:** clear off heat and stop bleeding

**Needle Technique:** Reducing

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Zhongji (Ren 3)]] | adjust the qi of the Chong and Ren Meridians so as to check the escape of blood |
| [[Xuehai (Sp 10)]] | remove heat from blood to stop bleeding |
| [[Yinbai (Sp 1)]] | often helpful to metrorrhagia |
| [[Ququan (Liv 8)]] | sooth and regulate the liver qi |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Affection of external heat:**
- [[Quchi (L I 11)]]

**For Excessive heart [[fire]]:**
- [[Shaofu (H 8)]]

**For Excessive liver [[fire]]:**
- [[Taichong (Liv 3)]]

#### Explanation
Zhongji (Ren 3), the meeting point of the three foot yin meridians and the Ren and Chong Meridians, is used to adjust the qi of the Chong and Ren Meridians so as to check the escape of blood. Yinbai (Sp 1), the Jing-(Well) Point of the Spleen Meridian, is often helpful to metrorrhagia. Ququan (Liv 8) functions to sooth and regulate the liver qi. Xuehai used (Sp. 10) with the reducing method may remove heat from blood to stop bleeding. All the points functioning together can clear heat, reduce fire, regulate meridians and cease bleeding. In case of varied symptoms, Quchi (L I 11) is added to dissipate the pathogenic heat, and Shaofu (H 8) is used to clear away the heart fire, and Taichong (Liv 3) to reduce the liver fire.

### Pattern: Qi deficiency

**Treatment Principle:** promote the restricting function of qi

**Needle Technique:** Reinforcing/Moxibustion

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Baihui (Du 20)]] | helps the ascending of yang qi, an application of the principle of using upper points for lower disorders |
| [[Guanyuan (Ren 4)]] | adjust the Chong and Ren Meridians, promote the restricting function of qi and stop uterine bleeding |
| [[Zusanli (S 36)]] | tonify the spleen and foster the restriction of qi on blood |
| [[Sanyinjiao (Sp 6)]] | tonify the spleen and foster the restriction of qi on blood |
| [[Yinbai (Sp 1)]] | tonify the spleen and foster the restriction of qi on blood |
| [[Yangchi (S J 4)]] | build up the functions of the Chong and Ren Meridians and foster the restriction of qi on blood |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Spleen qi deficiency manifested by anorexia and loose stools:**
- [[Pishu (B 20)]]
- [[Weishu (B 21)]]

#### Explanation
Guanyuan (Ren 4) can adjust the Chong and Ren Meridians, promote the restricting function of qi and stop uterine bleeding. Sanyinjiao (Sp 6), Yinbai (Sp 1) and Zusanli (S 36) are together used to tonify the spleen and foster the restriction of qi on blood. Moxibustion applied to Baihui (Du 22) helps the ascending of yang qi, an application of the principle of using upper points for lower disorders. Yangchi (S J 4) is the Yuan-(Primary) Point of the Sanjiao Meridian, which maintains the qi in general. Needling Yangchi (S J 4) with the reinforcing method may build up the functions of the Chong and Ren Meridians and foster the restriction of qi on blood.
