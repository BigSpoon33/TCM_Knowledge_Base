# ü©∫ Goiter

## üìñ Overview

Goiter denotes an enlargement of the thyroid gland, causing a swelling in the front part of the neck, which is not accompanied by pain, ulceration or skin discolouration. According to the records of ancient literature, it can be classified as "qi goiter," "flesh goiter" and "stone goiter." In this section only "qi goiter" and "flesh goiter" are discussed.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Swelling in the front part of the neck
- Absence of pain, ulceration or skin discolouration
- Qi goiter: diffusive swelling, soft, gradually increasing in size with unclear margins, normal colour, absence of pain; size changes with emotions, sometimes accompanied by dyspnea and hoarseness of voice.
- Flesh goiter: oval movable lumps below Adam‚Äôs Apple, smooth surface, no pain; often accompanied by exophthalmos, hot temper, irritability, tremor of the hands, sweating, stuffiness in the chest, palpitation, irregular menstruation.

## üè• Western Medicine Correlation

**Modern Diagnosis:**
- Simple goiter
- Hyperthyroidism

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Exasperation, anxiety or mental depression leading to stagnation of qi
2. Accumulation of fluid forming phlegm
3. Drinking water from certain localities where the soil and water are not good (e.g., mountainous areas with black soil and spring water)

### Pathological Mechanism
Goiter primarily stems from emotional factors such as exasperation, anxiety, or mental depression, which cause the stagnation of qi. This qi stagnation, in turn, leads to the accumulation of body fluids, forming phlegm. Environmental factors, specifically drinking water from certain unfavorable localities, also contribute to qi stagnation and the accumulation of phlegm-[[damp]], eventually resulting in the formation of goiter.

**Affected Organs:** Liver (due to qi stagnation from emotional factors), Spleen (for fluid metabolism and phlegm formation), San Jiao (for overall qi and fluid circulation)

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Goiter (General Treatment)

**Type:** Mixed

#### Main Manifestations
- Diffusive swelling in the neck (soft, unclear margins, changes with emotions)
- Oval movable lumps below Adam‚Äôs Apple (smooth surface)
- Dyspnea
- Hoarseness of voice
- Exophthalmos
- Hot temper
- Irritability
- Tremor of the hands
- Sweating
- Stuffiness in the chest
- Palpitation
- Irregular menstruation
- Boulimia (implied by point functions)

**Tongue:** Not explicitly described for general treatment, but often reflects qi stagnation (darkish), phlegm (greasy coating), and heat (red body, thin yellow coat) in specific manifestations.
**Pulse:** String-taut, slippery and rapid pulse (especially observed in flesh goiter type).

#### TCM Analysis
The condition is characterized by stagnation of qi, accumulation of phlegm, and often secondary blood stasis. Emotional disturbances lead to Liver Qi stagnation, impairing the flow of Qi and fluids, which congeals into phlegm and blocks the meridians in the neck. Poor water quality can also contribute to this pathology.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Goiter (General Treatment)

**Treatment Principle:** Activate blood circulation and remove blood stasis, and disperse the agglomeration through promoting the qi circulation by reducing method.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing Method; Reinforcing/Even/Moxibustion (Techniques Vary For Supplementary Points)

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[S J 13]] | To remove obstruction from the meridians, relieve qi stagnation and phlegm accumulation for goiter, as Sanjiao dominates the qi of the whole body. |
| [[L I 17]] | Local point on the neck to regulate local circulation of qi and blood, remove blood stasis and disperse agglomeration. |
| [[S I 17]] | Local point on the neck to regulate local circulation of qi and blood, remove blood stasis and disperse agglomeration. |
| [[REN-22]] | Local point on the neck to regulate local circulation of qi and blood, remove blood stasis and disperse agglomeration. |
| [[L I 4]] | Promotes qi circulation in the Hand Yangming Meridian, which passes through the neck region, eliminating stagnation of qi and blood. |
| [[ST-36]] | Promotes qi circulation in the Foot Yangming Meridian, which passes through the neck region, eliminating stagnation of qi and blood. |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Liver-qi stagnation:**
- [[REN-17]]
- [[LIV-3]]

**For Palpitation:**
- [[P-6]]
- [[HE-7]]

**For Exophthalmos:**
- [[S J 23]]
- [[BL-2]]
- [[BL-1]]
- [[GB-20]]

**For Hot temper, anxiety and sweating:**
- [[SP-6]]
- [[KID-7]]

#### Explanation
Naohui (S J 13) is a point of the Sanjiao Meridian of Hand-Shaoyang. Sanjiao dominates the qi of the whole body. So Naohui (S J 13) is used to remove obstruction from the meridians in order to relieve qi stagnation and phlegm accumulation for the goiter. Tianding (L I 17), Tianrong (S I 17) and Tiantu (Ren 22) are located on the neck. Puncturing them is to regulate the local circulation of qi and blood, to remove blood stasis and disperse agglomeration. Hegu (L I 4) and Zusanli (S 36) belong respectively to the Hand and Foot Yangming Meridians, which pass through the neck region. They have the action of promoting qi circulation in the Yangming Meridians and eliminating stagnation of qi and blood. Tanzhong (Ren 17) is an Influential Point of qi, and Taichong (Liv 3) is the Yuan-(Primary) Point of the Liver Meridian. Both are used to regulate the circulation of the liver qi. Shenmen (H 7) is the Yuan-(Primary) Point of the Heart Meridian, and Neiguan (P 6), the Luo-(Connecting) Point of the Pericardium Meridian. They are effective for palpitation. Sizhukong (S J 23), Zanzhu (B 2) and Jingming (B 1) are local points. Fengchi (G 20) connects with the eye region. These four points are used together to readjust the circulation of qi and blood in the eye region so as to control exophthalmos. Sanyinjiao (Sp 6) and Fuliu (K 7) are used to reinforce yin and check yang in order to relieve irritability, boulimia and excessive perspiration.

## üìä Prognosis

Not explicitly detailed in the provided text.

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention & Prophylaxis

Avoid emotional exasperation, anxiety, or mental depression. Avoid residing in or consuming water from localities with poor soil and water quality, especially mountainous areas with black soil where the spring takes its source.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Clinical Remarks

1. The morbid condition described here refers to simple goiter and hyperthyroidism in modern medicine. 2. The method of puncturing with several needles surrounding the goiter and with one needle in the center has a fairly good effect of reducing the goiter.
