# ü©∫ Breast Abscess

## üìñ Overview

Breast abscess is an acute purulent disorder of the breast mostly found in lactation period after delivery. It is rare in the duration of pregnancy.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Redness, swelling and pain of the breast
- Mostly occurring after delivery
- Early stage: lump in the breast, swelling, distension, pain, difficult lactation, chills, fever, headache, nausea, dire thirst
- Suppuration stage: growing of the lump, local bright redness, intermittent throbbing pain

**Modern Diagnosis:**
- acute mastitis

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Retention of milk in the breast due to mental depression affecting the qi of the liver
2. Overtaking of fatty food that brings about stagnation of heat in the Stomach Meridian
3. Obstruction of the milk duct after invasion of exogenous toxic [[fire]] into the breast through the rupture of the nipple

### Pathological Mechanism
Retention of milk in the breast due to mental depression affecting the qi of the liver or due to overtaking of fatty food that brings about stagnation of heat in the Stomach Meridian or due to obstruction of the milk duct after invasion of exogenous toxic [[fire]] into the breast through the rupture of the nipple. Since the stagnated liver qi and obstructed lactation lead to production of heat, there occurs redness, swelling, and pain of the breast with difficult lactation. The confrontation between the exogenous pathogenic factors and the body resistance causes chills, fever and headache. The pathogenic heat in the stomach disturbs the descending of the stomach qi, manifested by nausea and dire thirst. Unrelieved stagnation of milk may produce heat. "Extreme heat causes putrid muscle, and pus follows." So there is growing of the lump in the breast with bright redness, burning and intermittent throbbing pain.

**Affected Organs:** Liver, Stomach

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Heat-Stagnation with Toxic [[Fire]]

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Redness, swelling and pain of the breast
- Mostly occurring after delivery
- At the early stage when the abscess has not yet been formed, there is a lump in the breast accompanied by swelling, distension, pain, difficult lactation, chills, fever, headache, nausea, and dire thirst
- Growing of the lump with local bright redness and intermittent throbbing pain indicates suppuration

**Tongue:** Not mentioned
**Pulse:** Not mentioned

#### TCM Analysis
Since the stagnated liver qi and obstructed lactation lead to production of heat, there occurs redness, swelling, and pain of the breast with difficult lactation. The confrontation between the exogenous pathogenic factors and the body resistance causes chills, fever and headache. The pathogenic heat in the stomach disturbs the descending of the stomach qi, manifested by nausea and dire thirst. Unrelieved stagnation of milk may produce heat. "Extreme heat causes putrid muscle, and pus follows." So there is growing of the lump in the breast with bright redness, burning and intermittent throbbing pain.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Heat-Stagnation with Toxic Fire

**Treatment Principle:** Regulate the qi of the Liver and Stomach Meridians, remove stagnation and disperse heat.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[GB-21]] | To adjust qi circulation and remove obstruction of qi in the chest and hypochondriac regions, being an effective point in treating the breast abscess. |
| [[REN-17]] | To regulate the activity of qi and remove obstruction of lactation. |
| [[ST-18]] | To lower the stomach fire in order to eliminate the accumulation of pathogenic factors in the Yangming Meridian. |
| [[SI 1]] | An empirical point for the treatment of the breast abscess. |
| [[ST-36]] | To lower the stomach fire in order to eliminate the accumulation of pathogenic factors in the Yangming Meridian. |
| [[LIV-3]] | To remove the stagnation. |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Chills and fever:**
- [[L I 4]]
- [[S J 5]]

**For Distension and pain in the breast:**
- [[GB-41]]

#### Explanation
The nipple is on the Liver Meridian, and the breast is located in the area where the Stomach Meridian is distributed. The breast abscess is caused by pathogenic heat in the stomach and the stagnation of liver qi. That is why Taichong (Liv 3) is used to remove the stagnation, Zusanli (S 36) and Rugen (S 18) are to lower the stomach fire in order to eliminate the accumulation of pathogenic factors in the Yangming Meridian. Tanzhong (Ren 17) is to regulate the activity of qi and remove obstruction of lactation. Foot-Shaoyang Meridian runs along the chest and hypochondriac regions, so Jianjing (G 21) is used to adjust qi circulation and remove obstruction of qi in the chest and hypochondriac regions, being an effective point in treating the breast abscess. Shaoze (SI 1) is an empirical point for the treatment of the breast abscess. Hegu (LI 4) clears the heat away from the Yangming Meridian. Waiguan (SJ 5) connecting the Yangwei Meridian is used to treat chills and fever. Zulinqi (G 41) spreads qi and blood and removes obstruction of lactation so as to relieve distension and pain in the breast.
