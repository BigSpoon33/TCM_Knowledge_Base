# ü©∫ Prolapse of Uterus

## üìñ Overview

Prolapse of uterus refers to descent of the uterus into the vagina, or descent of the front wall of the vagina with the uterus. Usually it is the result of the sinking of inadequate qi, kidney qi deficiency, instable Chong and Ren Meridians, and the loss of restriction by Dai Meridian.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Descent of the uterus into the vagina or out of the vulva
- Descent of the front wall of the vagina with the uterus
- Sinking sensation in the lower abdomen
- Bearing sensation in the lower abdomen

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Insufficiency of the qi in the middle jiao caused by weak constitution
2. Early physical labour after delivery before qi and blood are fully restored
3. Exhaustion in delivery
4. Overstrain to counteract constipation
5. Frequent pregnancy and delivery
6. Indulgence in sexual life overconsuming the kidney qi

### Pathological Mechanism
The occurrence is often due to conditions that bring about sinking of qi, which fails to keep the uterus in position. This includes insufficiency of qi in the middle jiao or overstrain. Additionally, frequent pregnancy and delivery or indulgence in sexual life can overconsume kidney qi, leading to loss of restriction by the Dai Meridian and weakened functioning of the Chong and Ren Meridians, thus causing prolapse of the uterus.

**Affected Organs:** Uterus, Spleen, Kidney, Chong Meridian, Ren Meridian, Dai Meridian

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Qi deficiency

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Drop of the uterus in the vagina or out of the vulva several inches
- Sinking sensation in the lower abdomen
- Lassitude
- Palpitation
- Shortness of breath
- Frequent urine
- Leukorrhagia

**Tongue:** pale tongue with thin coating
**Pulse:** weak pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Since the qi is too weak to conduct its sustaining function of uterus, prolapse of uterus appears. It is relieved by lying down and aggravated by prolonged standing, with a sinking sensation in the lower abdomen and frequent urine. The weakened spleen and stomach lead to lassitude. Malnutrition of heart results in palpitation and shortness of breath. The downward going of pathogenic [[damp]] turns to excessive leukorrhea. Pale tongue and weak pulse are signs of qi deficiency.

### Pattern 2: Kidney deficiency

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Prolapse of uterus
- Sore and weak low back and legs
- Bearing sensation in the lower abdomen
- [[Dryness]] in the vagina
- Frequent urine
- Dizziness
- Tinnitus

**Tongue:** pink tongue
**Pulse:** deep weak pulse

#### TCM Analysis
The kidney is located at the low back. With the kidney in deficiency, the Chong and Ren Meridians become weakened, and the Dai Meridian loses its restricting function, thus there appear the prolapse of uterus, frequent urine, sore and weak low back and legs. Dizziness, tinnitus and dry vagina derive from the insufficiency of essence and blood. Deep weak pulse and pink tongue are signs of kidney deficiency.
