# ü©∫ Deviation of Eye and Mouth

## üìñ Overview

Deviation of the eye and the mouth is derived from invasion of the meridians and collaterals and muscle meridians in the facial region by exogeneous pathogenic [[wind]] and [[cold]]. This condition causes paralysis of the facial muscles, leading to an imbalance in facial expression such as incomplete eye closure and drooping of the mouth. It mostly affects males aged twenty to forty.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Sudden onset, usually right after waking up
- Incomplete closure of the eye in the affected side
- Drooping of the angle of the mouth
- Salivation
- Inability to frown
- Inability to raise the eyebrow
- Inability to close the eye
- Inability to blow out the cheek
- Inability to show the teeth or whistle
- Pain in the mastoid region or headache (in some cases)

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Invasion of the meridians and collaterals and muscle meridians in the facial region by exogeneous pathogenic [[wind]] and [[cold]]
2. Attack of pathogenic [[wind]] and [[cold]] on Yangming and Shaoyang Meridians

### Pathological Mechanism
Paralysis of the facial muscles caused by the attack of pathogenic wind and cold on Yangming and Shaoyang Meridians, which leads to malnutrition of the muscle regions of the meridians. This results in flaccidity of affected muscles, leading to the imbalance of facial muscles between the two sides. The paralytic muscles are caused by stagnation of qi in the meridians and malnutrition of the regions of the muscle meridians after the invasion of pathogenic wind and cold.

**Affected Organs:** Facial muscles, Stomach (Yangming Meridian), Large Intestine (Yangming Meridian), Gallbladder (Shaoyang Meridian), San Jiao (Shaoyang Meridian)

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Invasion of Exogenous Wind-Cold

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Sudden onset, usually right after waking up
- Incomplete closure of the eye in the affected side
- Drooping of the angle of the mouth
- Salivation
- Inability to frown
- Inability to raise the eyebrow
- Inability to close the eye
- Inability to blow out the cheek
- Inability to show the teeth or whistle
- Pain in the mastoid region (in some cases)
- Headache (in some cases)

**Tongue:** thin white tongue coating
**Pulse:** superficial tense or superficial slow pulse

#### TCM Analysis
It is known that the Foot and Hand Yangming and Shaoyang Meridians supply the facial region, and the Muscle Meridians of Hand and Foot Yangming and Shaoyang also reach the forehead, cheek, and the front of the ear. The above manifestations of deviation of the eye and the mouth are due to the flaccidity of affected muscles leading to the imbalance of facial muscles between the two sides. The paralytic muscles are caused by stagnation of qi in the meridians and malnutrition of the regions of the muscle meridians after the invasion of pathogenic wind and cold.
