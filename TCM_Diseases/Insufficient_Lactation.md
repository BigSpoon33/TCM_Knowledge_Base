# ü©∫ Insufficient Lactation

## üìñ Overview

Insufficient lactation refers to the common clinical symptom that milk secretion of a nursing mother is insufficient to feed the baby. In some cases there may even be no secretion of milk at all. Ancient people named it as lack of milk and halted milk flow due to deficiency of qi and blood or to stagnation of the liver qi.

**Key Characteristics:**
- insufficient milk secretion
- absence of milk secretion
- occurs in nursing mothers
- divided into [[deficiency and excess]] types

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Deficiency of qi and blood
2. Liver qi stagnation

### Pathological Mechanism
Deficiency of qi and blood: Milk is transformed from qi and blood, the origin of which are nutrient substances of food or the acquired essence. Either the weakness of the spleen and stomach or profuse loss of qi and blood during delivery may affect the formation of milk, leading to insufficient secretion. Liver qi stagnation: It is caused by mental depression after delivery, impaired dispersing of the liver qi, disorder of qi and blood, blockage of the meridians, and obstructed flow of milk, finally bringing on the insufficient lactation.

**Affected Organs:** Spleen, Stomach, Liver, Heart, Chong Meridian, Ren Meridian

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Deficiency of qi and blood

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Insufficient secretion of milk after delivery or even absence of milk
- decreasing secretion during lactation period
- no distending pain in the breast
- pale complexion
- dry skin
- palpitation
- lassitude
- poor appetite
- loose stools

**Tongue:** pale tongue with little coating
**Pulse:** weak and thready pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Because of the deficiency of qi and blood, the weakened transforming source of milk leads to scanty secretion without distension in breasts. Insufficient qi and blood makes pale face and dry skin. Palpitation ensues on malnutrition of the heart and blood. Dysfunction of the spleen and insufficiency of qi in the middle jiao give rise to lassitude, poor appetite and loose stools. Pale tongue and weak thready pulse are signs of deficiency of both qi and blood.

### Pattern 2: Liver qi stagnation

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Absence of milk secretion after delivery
- distending pain in breast
- mental depression
- chest distress and hypochondriac pain
- epigastric distension
- loss of appetite

**Tongue:** pink tongue
**Pulse:** string-taut pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Liver carries out the dispersing function of qi. Mental depression after delivery impairs liver qi, which obstructs the milk flow, leading to the distending pain in the breast, and hypochondriac pain. Disharmony of the stomach causes epigastric distension and loss of appetite. String-taut pulse is another sign of stagnated liver qi.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Deficiency of qi and blood

**Treatment Principle:** Acupuncture is given with reinforcing method and moxibustion to tonify the qi and blood so as to promote lactic secretion.

**Needle Technique:** Reinforcing/Moxibustion

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Rugen (S 28)]] | restore the free flow of qi in the Yangming Meridian so as to promote the lactic secretion |
| [[Tanzhong (Ren 17)]] | regulate qi and promotes the flow of milk |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Deficiency of qi and blood:**
- [[Pishu (B 20)]]

- [[Sanyinjiao (Sp 6)]]

#### Explanation
Since breast is where Foot-Yangming Meridian passes and Rugen (S 28) is located on the Stomach Meridian of Foot-Yangming at the breast, Rugen (S 28) is used here to restore the free flow of qi in the Yangming Meridian so as to promote the lactic secretion. Tanzhong (Ren 17), the Confluential Point of qi, serves to regulate qi and promotes the flow of milk. Shaoze (S I 1) is an effective and empirical lactogenic point. Pishu (B 20), Zusanli (S 36) and Sanyinjiao (Sp 6) are used to regulate and tonify spleen and stomach, promote the transformation of milk from blood.
