# ü©∫ Mumps

## üìñ Overview

Mumps is an acute infectious disease characterized by painful swelling in the parotid region, caused by epidemic [[wind]] heat. It happens in all the seasons of a year, but mostly in winter and spring. It is more frequently seen among preschool children, but seldom in those under two years.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Painful swelling in the parotid region
- Chills and fever
- Dysmasesia
- Can lead to pain and swelling of the testis

## üè• Western Medicine Correlation

**Modern Diagnosis:**
- Epidemic parotitis

---

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Invasion of the epidemic pathogen via the mouth and nose

### Pathological Mechanism
The epidemic pathogen enters the body, and together with phlegm [[fire]], it obstructs the collaterals of Shaoyang Meridians. This causes abnormal circulation of qi and blood, leading to pain and swelling in the parotid region, often associated with chills and fever. Intense pathogenic heat can consume the fluid of the Yangming collaterals. If the pathogenic factor is transmitted internally to the Jueyin Meridian, it can cause redness, swelling, and pain of the testis.

**Affected Organs:** Parotid region, Shaoyang Meridians, Yangming collaterals, Jueyin Meridians, Testis

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Epidemic [[Wind]]-Heat Attacking Shaoyang

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Chills and fever
- Redness, pain and swelling in unilateral or bilateral parotid regions
- Dysmasesia
- More marked redness, pain and swelling in the parotid region (if intense heat)
- Pain and swelling of the testis (if intense heat)
- High fever with irritability (if intense heat)
- [[Dryness]] of the mouth (if intense heat)
- Constipation (if intense heat)
- Dark urine (if intense heat)

**Tongue:** Yellow tongue coating
**Pulse:** Superficial and rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
The disease is caused by exogenous attack of the epidemic pathogenic heat, resulting in the exterior syndrome of chills and fever at the beginning. Agglomeration of the pathogenic heat in the Shaoyang collaterals leads to redness, pain, and swelling in the parotid region, and dysmasesia. Intense pathogenic heat consumes the fluid of the Yangming collaterals, causing [[dryness]] of the mouth, constipation, and dark urine. The Shaoyang Meridians are interiorly-exteriorly related with the Jueyin Meridians, and the Foot Jueyin Meridian winds around the genital organs; thus, when the pathogenic factor is transmitted internally to the Jueyin Meridian, there are redness, swelling, and pain of the testis. Yellow tongue coating and superficial rapid pulse are signs of invasion of pathogenic heat.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Epidemic [[Wind]]-Heat Attacking Shaoyang

**Treatment Principle:** Expel wind and heat and remove the agglomeration.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Jiache (S 6)]] | Applied to eliminate the pathogenic heat. |
| [[Yifeng (S J 17)]] | Used to resolve the local stagnation of qi and blood. |
| [[Waiguan (S J 5)]] | Employed in combination with the points from Yangming Meridian, to expel the wind, dissipate the agglomeration, and clear away the pathogenic heat. |
| [[Quchi (L I 11)]] | Applied to eliminate the pathogenic heat. |
| [[Hegu (L I 4)]] | Applied to eliminate the pathogenic heat. |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Chills and fever:**
- [[Lieque (L 7)]]

**For High fever:**
- [[Dazhui (Du 14)]]
- [[Twelve Jing-(Well) Points (L 11, L I 1, P 9, S J 1, H 9, S I 1)]]

**For Swelling and pain of testis:**
- [[Taichong (Liv 3)]]
- [[Ququan (Liv 8)]]

#### Explanation
Mumps is located in the area pertaining to Shaoyang Meridians. Yifeng (S J 17), the meeting point of Hand and Foot Shaoyang Meridians, is used to resolve the local stagnation of qi and blood. Since the Hand Yangming Meridian travels up to the face, Jiache (S 6), Quchi (L I 11) and Hegu (L I 4) are applied to eliminate the pathogenic heat. Waiguan (S J 5), the meeting point of Hand Shaoyang Meridian and Yangwei Meridian, is employed in combination with the points from Yangming Meridian, to expel the wind, dissipate the agglomeration, and clear away the pathogenic heat. Lieque (L 7) is combined to disperse wind and alleviate the exterior symptoms for those suffering from chills and fever. Dazhui (Du 14) and Twelve Jing-(Well) Points are used to bring down the high fever. Taichong (Liv 3) and Ququan (Liv 8) regain the normal circulation of qi in Foot Jueyin Meridian for those with the pain and swelling of testis.

## üìä Prognosis

Acupuncture and moxibustion provides satisfactory effect.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Clinical Remarks

a) Mumps is also called epidemic parotitis. Acupuncture and moxibustion provides satisfactory effect.
b) Moxibustion with Medulla Junci:
   Point: Jiaosun (S J 20)
   Method: Two pieces of rush pith soaked with vegetable oil are ignited and aimed at the point Jiaosun (S J 20). Remove them quickly as soon as there is a sound of burning of the skin. Usually the swelling will subside after one treatment. The treatment can be repeated the next day if the swelling is not completely gone.
