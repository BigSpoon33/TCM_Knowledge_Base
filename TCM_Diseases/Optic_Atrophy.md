# ü©∫ Optic Atrophy

## üìñ Overview

Optic atrophy is a chronic eye disorder characterized by gradual degeneration of vision acuity. Initially, it presents as blurring of vision, but in late stages, it can lead to total loss of eyesight.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Gradual degeneration of vision acuity
- Blurring of vision at early stage
- Total loss of eyesight at late stage

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Deficiency of the kidney and liver yin, leading to consumption of essence and blood that nourish the eyes.
2. Dysfunction in transportation and transformation of the spleen due to irregular diet and overstrain, resulting in inadequate supply of essential nutrients for the eyes.
3. Dysfunction of the liver with stagnation of qi and blood due to emotional troubles, causing failure of the essential qi to flow upwards to nourish the eyes.

### Pathological Mechanism
Optic atrophy is fundamentally a condition of chronic malnourishment or obstruction to the eyes. It is rooted in three primary pathological mechanisms: 1) Deficiency of Liver and Kidney Yin, which consumes the essence and blood vital for nourishing the eyes. 2) Spleen dysfunction in its transportation and transformation functions, often exacerbated by irregular diet or overstrain, leading to insufficient qi and blood to supply the ocular region. 3) Stagnation of Liver Qi and blood, frequently triggered by emotional disturbances, which impedes the upward flow of essential qi to the eyes. These processes collectively result in the progressive degeneration of visual acuity.

**Affected Organs:** Liver, Kidney, Spleen, Eyes

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Deficiency of the liver and kidney yin

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- [[Dryness]] of the eyes
- Blurred vision
- Dizziness
- Tinnitus
- Nocturnal emission
- Aching of the lower back

**Tongue:** Reddened tongue with scanty coating
**Pulse:** Thready and weak pulse

#### TCM Analysis
[[Dryness]] of the eyes and blurred vision are due to failure of the essential nutrients to nourish the eyes in deficiency of the liver and kidney yin. The lumbus is the seat of the kidney. When the kidney is in a deficiency state, there is aching of the lower back. Deficiency of the kidney yin may lead to nocturnal emission when there is hyperactivity of the asthenic [[fire]], and to dizziness and tinnitus when there is yang preponderance. Thready and weak pulse, reddened tongue with scanty coating are signs of yin deficiency.

### Pattern 2: Deficiency of qi and blood

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Blurred vision
- Weakness of breath
- Disinclination to talk
- Lassitude
- Poor appetite
- Loose stools

**Tongue:** Pale tongue with thin white coating
**Pulse:** Thready and weak pulse

#### TCM Analysis
The essential qi of all the zang-fu organs flows up to the eyes. When qi and blood in a deficiency state cannot nourish the eyes, the vision becomes blurred. Qi deficiency of the spleen and stomach causes weakness of breath, disinclination to talk, lassitude, poor appetite and loose stools. Thready and weak pulse, pale tongue with thin and white coating are signs of deficiency of qi and blood.

### Pattern 3: Stagnation of the liver qi

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Blurred vision
- Emotional depression
- Dizziness
- Vertigo
- Hypochondriac pain
- Bitter taste in the mouth
- Dry throat

**Tongue:** Not specified
**Pulse:** String-taut pulse

#### TCM Analysis
The liver has its specific body opening in the eyes. Stagnation of the liver qi causes general obstruction of qi and blood which fail to ascend to nourish the eyes. So the vision is blurred. The Liver Meridian passes by the hypochondriac region, so there is hypochondriac pain when the liver qi is stagnated. Retarded qi may turn into [[fire]], which flares up to cause dizziness, vertigo, bitter taste in the mouth and dry throat. String-taut pulse is the sign of a liver disease.
