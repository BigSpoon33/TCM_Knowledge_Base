# ðŸ©º Epigastric Pain

## ðŸ“– Overview

Epigastric pain is a common symptom, often characterized by repeated recurrence. Since the pain is close to the cardia, it was also named "cardio-abdominal pain" or "cardiac pain" in ancient times.

**Key Characteristics:**
- repeated recurrence

---

## ðŸ§¬ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Irregular food intake, preference for raw and [[cold]] food and hunger injure the spleen and stomach.
2. Anxiety, anger and mental depression damage the liver.
3. Generally lowered functioning of the spleen and stomach, due to invasion of pathogenic [[cold]].

### Pathological Mechanism
Failure of the spleen in transportation and transformation, failure of the stomach qi in descending, failure of the liver in dominating free flow of qi adversely attacking the stomach, impeding its activity and hindering its qi descending, or stagnation of pathogenic [[cold]] in the stomach causing failure of the stomach qi in descending.

**Affected Organs:** Spleen, Stomach, Liver

## ðŸ”¬ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Retention of food

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Distending pain in the epigastrium, aggravated on pressure or after meals
- Belching with fetid odour
- Anorexia

**Tongue:** Thick, sticky tongue coating
**Pulse:** Deep, forceful or rolling pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Retention of food in the stomach makes the stomach qi fail to descend, then distending pain in the epigastrium and belching with fetid odour occur. Retention of food is an excess condition, pain is therefore aggravated upon pressure. Since the stomach is injured by retention of food, pain becomes worse after meals and anorexia appears. Thick, sticky tongue coating, deep, forceful or rolling pulse are the signs of retention of food.

### Pattern 2: Attack of the stomach by the liver qi

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Paroxysmal pain in the epigastrium, radiating to the hypochondriac regions
- Frequent belching accompanied by nausea, vomiting, acid regurgitation
- Abdominal distension
- Anorexia

**Tongue:** Thin, white tongue coating
**Pulse:** Deep, string-taut pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Stagnation of the liver qi makes the liver fail to dominate the free flow of qi. If the depressed liver qi attacks the stomach, pain in the epigastrium appears. As the Liver Meridian locates along both hypochondriac regions, the pain is wandering and may be referred to both hypochondriac regions. In case of stagnation of the qi, belching occurs, even symptoms like nausea, vomiting, acid regurgitation, abdominal distension and anorexia may appear. Thin, white tongue coating and deep string-taut pulse are the signs of attack of the stomach by the perverse liver qi.

### Pattern 3: Deficiency of the stomach with stagnation of cold

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Dull pain in the epigastrium, which may be relieved by pressure and warmth
- General lassitude
- Regurgitation of thin fluid

**Tongue:** Thin, white tongue coating
**Pulse:** Deep, slow pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Lowered function of the spleen and stomach with cold invasion retards transportation and transformation, so dull pain appears in the epigastrium. The spleen dominates the limbs. If the spleen yang is weak, general lassitude occurs, as well as the regurgitation of thin fluid. Since the condition is due to deficiency and cold, pain is relieved on pressure and by warming. Thin, white coating and deep slow pulse are the signs of lowered function of the spleen and stomach with cold stagnation.
