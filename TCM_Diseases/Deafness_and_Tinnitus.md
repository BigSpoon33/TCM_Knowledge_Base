# ü©∫ Deafness and Tinnitus

## üìñ Overview

Both deafness and tinnitus are auditory disturbances. Tinnitus is characterized by ringing sound in the ears felt by the patient and deafness is failing or loss of hearing. Because of the similarities between these two conditions in etiology and treatment, they are discussed together.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Ringing sound in the ears (tinnitus)
- Failing or loss of hearing (deafness)

## üè• Western Medicine Correlation

**Modern Diagnosis:**
- Neural auditory disturbances

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Fury or fright with upward rush of [[wind]] [[fire]] of the liver and gallbladder
2. Invasion of pathogenic [[wind]] blocking the orifice
3. Deficiency of the kidney qi
4. Failure of essential qi to ascend to the ear

### Pathological Mechanism
Deafness and tinnitus are divided into two types: [[deficiency and excess]]. The excess type is caused by fury or fright with upward rush of [[wind]] [[fire]] of the liver and gallbladder that obstructs the qi circulation in the Shaoyang Meridians or caused by invasion of pathogenic wind blocking the orifice. The deficiency type is due to deficiency of the kidney qi and failure of essential qi to ascend to the ear.

**Affected Organs:** Liver, Gallbladder, Kidney

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Excess type

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Sudden deafness
- Distension sensation in the ear
- Constant ringing in the ear that cannot be eliminated by pressing
- Flushed face (with upward perversion of pathogenic wind [[fire]] of the liver and gallbladder)
- Dry mouth (with upward perversion of pathogenic wind fire of the liver and gallbladder)
- Irritability (with upward perversion of pathogenic wind fire of the liver and gallbladder)
- Hot temper (with upward perversion of pathogenic wind fire of the liver and gallbladder)
- Headache (with invasion of exogenous pathogenic wind)

**Pulse:** Forceful and string-taut pulse (for upward perversion of pathogenic wind fire of the liver and gallbladder), Superficial pulse (for invasion of exogenous pathogenic wind)

#### TCM Analysis
The pathogenic fire of the liver and gallbladder that flames up along the related meridians results in deafness, tinnitus, headache, flushed face, bitter taste in the mouth and [[dryness]] of the throat. Hyperfunction of the liver causes hot temper, and irritability is brought about by the pathogenic heat disturbing the mind. Forceful and string-taut pulse indicates the excess condition of the liver and gallbladder. When the pathogenic wind attacks the exterior of the body and obstructs the orifices, deafness, tinnitus and headache occur. Superficial pulse is a sign of invasion of the exogenous pathogenic wind.

### Pattern 2: Deficiency type

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Protracted deafness
- Intermittent tinnitus aggravated by strain
- Tinnitus eliminated by pressing
- Dizziness
- Soreness and aching of the lower back
- Seminal emission
- Excessive leukorrhea

**Pulse:** Thready and weak pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Hypofunction of the kidney makes essential qi fail to ascend and fill up the orifices, so there are deafness, tinnitus and dizziness. The loin is the house of the kidney, so hypofunction of the kidney causes soreness and aching of the lower Back. Deficiency of the kidney qi with impaired restraining function or deficiency of yin with flaming up of the asthenic fire that stimulates the seminal organs causes emission. Since the kidney loses its function of restricting the Dai Meridian, there is excessive leukorrhea. Thready and weak pulse are signs of deficiency condition.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Excess type

**Treatment Principle:** The reducing method is applied for excess condition.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Yifeng (S J 17)]] | To regulate the qi circulation in the Shaoyang Meridians |
| [[Tinghui (G 2)]] | To regulate the qi circulation in the Shaoyang Meridians |
| [[Xiaxi (G 43)]] | To regulate the qi circulation in the Shaoyang Meridians |
| [[Zhongzhu (S J 3)]] | To regulate the qi circulation in the Shaoyang Meridians |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Fire preponderance in the liver and gallbladder:**
- [[Xingjian (Liv 2)]]
- [[Zulinqi (G 41)]]

**For Invasion of exogenous pathogenic wind:**
- [[Waiguan (S J 5)]]
- [[Hegu (L I 4)]]

#### Explanation
The Shaoyang Meridians of Hand and Foot travel to the ear region, so points of Shaoyang Meridians are used, e.g. Zhongzhu (S J 3), Yifeng (S J 17) of Hand-Shaoyang, Tinghui (G 2) and Xiaxi (G 43) of Foot-Shaoyang, to regulate the qi circulation in the meridians. In the prescription, two local and two distal points are combined. Xingjian (Liv 2) and Zulinqi (G 41) are used to clear away the pathogenic fire from the liver and gallbladder, and to connect the upper and lower portions of the body. Waiguan (S J 5) and Hegu (L I 4) expel pathogenic wind.

### Pattern: Deficiency type

**Treatment Principle:** The reinforcing method is applied for deficiency condition. Moxibustion is also advisable.

**Needle Technique:** Reinforcing, Moxibustion

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Yifeng (S J 17)]] | To regulate the qi circulation in the Shaoyang Meridians |
| [[Tinghui (G 2)]] | To regulate the qi circulation in the Shaoyang Meridians |
| [[Xiaxi (G 43)]] | To regulate the qi circulation in the Shaoyang Meridians |

- [[Shenshu (B 23)]]
- [[Mingmen (Du 4)]]
- [[Taixi (K 3)]]

#### Explanation
The Shaoyang Meridians of Hand and Foot travel to the ear region, so points of Shaoyang Meridians are used, e.g. Zhongzhu (S J 3), Yifeng (S J 17) of Hand-Shaoyang, Tinghui (G 2) and Xiaxi (G 43) of Foot-Shaoyang, to regulate the qi circulation in the meridians. In the prescription, two local and two distal points are combined. Shenshu (B 23), Mingmen (Du 4) and Taixi (K 3) reinforce the essential qi of the kidney.
