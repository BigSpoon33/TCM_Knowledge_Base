## üìñ Overview

**Key Characteristics:**
- Pain of injured areas

- Motor impairment of joints
- Redness or ecchymosis (new injury)
- Tenderness (new injury)
- Absence of marked swelling but repeated recurrence (old injury)
- Pain exacerbated in bad weather (old injury)

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Injury of tendinous tissues and joints by violent movement
2. Awkward posture of the body
3. Bruise
4. Falling
5. Traction
6. Overtwisting

### Pathological Mechanism
Local stagnation of qi and blood in the meridians of diseased areas is due to injury of tendinous tissues and joints. In protracted cases, qi and blood are consumed, and their circulation in the meridians tends to be further obstructed by exposure to [[wind]], [[cold]] and [[damp]].

**Affected Organs:** Soft tissues, Skin, Muscles, Tendons, Joints, Meridians, Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist, Back, Hip, Knee, Ankle

#### TCM Analysis
Sprain or contusion at any place of the body is due to tendinous injury with local qi stagnation and blood stasis, manifested by swelling and pain with tenderness. In a protracted case, qi and blood are consumed, and their circulation in the meridians tends to be further obstructed by exposure to [[wind]], [[cold]] and [[damp]]. That is why pain is exacerbated in bad weather.

|-------|----------|
| [[Ashi points]] | Principal points for local pain and stagnation |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Neck injury:**
- [[BL-10]]
- [[ST-13]]

**For Shoulder joint injury:**
- [[GB-21]]
- [[L I 15]]

**For Elbow joint injury:**
- [[L I 11]]
- [[L I 4]]

**For Wrist joint injury:**
- [[S J 4]]
- [[S J 5]]

**For Hip joint injury:**
