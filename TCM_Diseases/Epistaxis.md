# ü©∫ Epistaxis

## üìñ Overview

Epistaxis in TCM is caused by pathogenic heat or [[fire]] rushing upwards to the nose, forcing blood out of vessels. This heat originates from accumulated [[wind]]-heat in the Lung, pathogenic [[fire]] in the Stomach, or upflaring of asthenic [[fire]] due to Yin deficiency.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Blood rushing out of vessels from the nose
- Associated with pathogenic heat or fire
- Can be excess (heat in Lung/Stomach) or deficiency (Yin deficiency with fire)

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Accumulated [[wind]] heat in the lung
2. Pathogenic fire in the stomach
3. Yin deficiency leading to upflaring of the asthenic fire

### Pathological Mechanism
The lung qi flows up to the nose. The Foot-Yangming Meridian starts at the side of the nose. If there is accumulated [[wind]] heat in the lung or pathogenic fire in the stomach, they would rush upward to the nose. If there is yin deficiency leading to upflaring of the asthenic fire, the blood would flow up together with the fire. All of these cause blood to rush out of the vessels, resulting in epistaxis.

**Affected Organs:** Lung, Stomach, Kidney

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Extreme heat in lung and stomach

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Epistaxis accompanied by fever
- Cough
- Dire thirst with preference for [[cold]] drink
- Constipation
- Foul breath
- Irritability and restlessness

**Tongue:** Reddened tongue, reddened tongue with yellow coating
**Pulse:** Superficial and rapid pulse, forceful and rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Extreme heat in the lung goes up to the nose, forcing blood to rush out of the vessels. The heat also causes dysfunction of the lung in spreading and descending of qi. The reverse flow of qi results in cough. Reddened tongue and rapid pulse are signs of heat in the lung. Sometimes epistaxis occurs when the stomach fire flares up along the meridians to the nose, and injures the blood vessels. Thirst and preference for [[cold]] drinking are caused by the stomach heat consuming the fluid. Exhaustion of fluid causes constipation. The stomach heat makes foul breath. Irritability and restlessness are due to extreme heat in the Yangming Meridians disturbing the heart mind. Reddened tongue with yellow coating and forceful rapid pulse are signs of the stomach heat.

### Pattern 2: Deficiency of yin with preponderance of fire

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Epistaxis accompanied by malar flush
- [[Dryness]] of the mouth
- Feverish sensation of the palms and soles
- Afternoon fever
- Night sweating

**Pulse:** Thready and rapid pulse

#### TCM Analysis
When deficiency of the kidney yin causes the asthenic fire to flare up to the nose, blood vessels are injured, resulting in epistaxis. Malar flush, [[dryness]] of the mouth, feverish sensation of the palms and soles, and afternoon fever are manifestations of the asthenic fire associated with yin deficiency. Night sweating is also due to the asthenic fire that forces the moisture to be given off. Thready and rapid pulse is a sign of yin deficiency.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Extreme heat in lung and stomach

**Treatment Principle:** clear off the heat and stop bleeding

**Needle Technique:** Reducing

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Yingxiang (L I 20)]] | clear off heat and stop bleeding |
| [[Hegu (L I 4)]] | clear off heat and stop bleeding |
| [[Shangxing (Du 23)]] | reduce heat of the Du Meridian |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Heat in the lung:**
- [[Shaoshang (L 11)]]

**For Heat in the stomach:**
- [[Neiting (S 44)]]

#### Explanation
The Hand-Yangming Meridian and Hand-Taiyin Meridian are exteriorly and interiorly related. The Hand-Yangming Meridian connects with the Foot-Yangming Meridian. So Yingxiang (L I 20) and Hegu (L I 4) are selected to clear off heat and stop bleeding. The Du Meridian is the sea of all the yang meridians. Extreme yang forces blood to rush out. So Shangxing (L I 20) is used to reduce heat of the Du Meridian. The lung has its specific body opening in the nose. Shaoshang (L 11), the Jing-(Well) Point of the Lung Meridian, is used to reduce heat of the lung. Neiting (S 44), the Ying-(Spring) Point of the Stomach Meridian, is good for eliminating the stomach fire.
