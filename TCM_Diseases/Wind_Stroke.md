# ðŸ©º [[Wind]] Stroke

## ðŸ“– Overview

[[Wind]] stroke is an emergency case manifested by falling down in a fit with loss of consciousness, or hemiplegia, slurred speech and deviated mouth. It is characterized by abrupt onset with pathological changes varying quickly like the [[wind]], from which the term "wind stroke" comes.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Abrupt onset
- Falling down in a fit with loss of consciousness
- Hemiplegia
- Slurred speech
- Deviated mouth
- Pathological changes varying quickly like the wind

---

## ðŸ§¬ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Deficiency of qi and blood
2. Deficiency in the lower part of the body and excess in the upper part
3. Deficiency of the kidney yin due to sexual indulgence
4. Irregular food intake, impeding spleen's transportation and transformation, leading to phlegm from accumulated dampness and transformation into heat
5. Exasperation, agitation, alcohol indulgence or overeating, overstrain and stress
6. Invasion of exogenous pathogenic wind

### Pathological Mechanism
Causative factors lead to upsurge of liver yang and heart [[fire]], causing qi and blood to go upward with turbid phlegm, disturbing the mind and resulting in Wind Stroke. Mild cases show dysfunction of meridians and collaterals, while severe cases involve both zang-fu organs and meridians. Attack on zang-fu organs can be tense (excess) due to phlegm heat or excessive [[fire]] in heart/liver, or flaccid (deficiency) due to deficiency of primary qi or collapse of kidney yang. Untreated tense syndrome may become flaccid, often leading to poor prognosis.

**Affected Organs:** Zang-fu organs, Meridians and collaterals, Liver, Heart, Spleen, Kidney

## ðŸ”¬ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Attack on the zang-fu organs: Tense syndrome

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Falling down in a fit with loss of consciousness
- Tightly closed hands
- Clenched jaws
- Flushed face
- Coarse breathing
- Rattling in the throat
- Retention of urine
- Constipation

**Tongue:** Red tongue with thick yellow or dark grey coating
**Pulse:** String-taut, rolling and forceful pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Wind stirred up by upsurge of liver yang sends qi and blood upwards, which together with the accumulated phlegm [[fire]] disturb the mind, leading to sudden loss of consciousness with tightly closed hands and clenched jaws, flushed face, coarse breathing, retention of urine and constipation. Excessive wind phlegm brings about rattling in the throat. Red tongue with thick yellow coating or dark grey coating, string-taut, rolling and forceful pulse are the signs of wind combined with phlegm fire.

---

### Pattern 2: Attack on the zang-fu organs: Flaccid syndrome

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Falling down in a fit and sudden loss of consciousness with mouth agape and eyes closed
- Snoring but feeble breathing
- Flaccid paralysis of limbs
- Incontinence of urine
- [[Cold]] limbs (in severe cases)
- Flushing of face as rouged (in severe cases)

**Tongue:** Flaccid tongue
**Pulse:** Thready, weak pulse, and in severe cases fading or big floating pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Severe weakness of primary qi, separation of [[yin and yang]] and exhaustion of qi in the zang organs are indicated in mouth agape, eyes closed, snoring but feeble breathing, flaccid paralysis, and incontinence of urine. Flaccid tongue and thready weak pulse suggest the deficiency of blood and prostration of the kidney yang. If complicated with [[cold]] limbs, flushed face, fading or big floating pulse, it is a critical case, indicating exhaustion of yin in the lower portion of the body and upward going of the isolated yang.

---

### Pattern 3: Attack on the meridians and collaterals

**Type:** Mixed

#### Main Manifestations
- Hemiplegia
- Numbness of the limbs
- Deviated mouth
- Slurring of speech
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Vertigo
- Twitching of muscles
- Red eyes
- Flushed face
- Thirst
- [[Dryness]] of the throat
- Irritability

**Pulse:** String taut and rolling pulse

#### TCM Analysis
Wind phlegm enters the meridians and collaterals due to imbalance of [[yin and yang]], or after treatment the functions of the affected zang-fu organs have been restored, but wind phlegm still blocks the meridians and collaterals, causing retarded circulation of qi and blood. Hence appears hemiplegia, numbness of the limbs, deviated mouth and slurring of speech. If complicated with upsurging of liver yang, and upward disturbance of wind yang, the symptoms are headache, dizziness, vertigo and twitching of muscles. If there is excessive fire in the heart and liver, there may be red eyes and flushed face, thirst, [[dryness]] of the throat and irritability. Stagnation of wind phlegm in the meridians and collaterals leads to a string-taut and rolling pulse.

## ðŸ’‰ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Attack on the zang-fu organs: Tense syndrome

**Treatment Principle:** Promote resuscitation, reduce wind and fire and resolve phlegm.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing Method Or Pricking, To Cause Little Bleeding

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Baihui (Du 20)]] | regulate qi of the Du Meridian, effecting resuscitation |
| [[Shuigou (Du 26)]] | regulate qi of the Du Meridian, effecting resuscitation |
| [[Fenglong (S 40)]] | invigorate the functions of the spleen and stomach and help to resolve the turbid phlegm |
| [[Taichong (Liv 3)]] | subdue the upsurging of qi in the Liver Meridian and pacify the liver yang |
| [[Yongquan (K 1)]] | conduct the heat downward |
| [[twelve Jing-(Well) points on both hands (L 11, H 9, P 9, LI 1, SJ 1, SI 1)]] | dispel heat and regain consciousness |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Clenched Jaws:**
- [[Xiaguan (S 7)]]
- [[Jiache (S 6)]]
- [[Hegu (L 14)]]

**For Aphasia and stiffness of tongue:**
- [[Yamen (Du 15)]]
- [[Lianquan (Ren 23)]]
- [[Tongli (H 5)]]

#### Explanation
As the condition is due to disturbance of the heart by phlegm fire associated with upsurging of liver yang and upward flowing of qi and blood, Baihui (Du 20) and Shuigou (Du 26) are selected to regulate qi of the Du Meridian, effecting resuscitation, Yongquan (K 1) is selected to conduct the heat downward, and Taichong (Liv 3) to subdue the upsurging of qi in the Liver Meridian and pacify the liver yang. Pricking the twelve Jing-(Well) points on both hands, where qi of the three yin and three yang meridians meet, may dispel heat and regain consciousness. The spleen and stomach are the source of phlegm production. Fenglong (S 40), the Luo-(Connecting) point of the Stomach Meridian can invigorate the functions of the spleen and stomach and help to resolve the turbid phlegm. Since the Yangming Meridians of Hand and Foot supply the cheeks, Xiaguan (S 7), Jiache (S 6) and Hegu (LI 4) are chosen to promote the circulation of qi and blood for relieving the clenched jaws. Yamen (Du 15) and Lianquan (Ren 23), being local and adjacent points of the tongue, and Tongli (H 5), the Luo-(Connecting) point of the Heart Meridian, may relieve stiffness of tongue.

| [[Shenque (Ren 8)]] | effective for collapse |
| [[Qihai (Ren 6)]] | effective for collapse |
| [[Guanyuan (Ren 4)]] | effective for collapse; strengthen the primary qi, and restore yang from collapse |

#### Explanation
Shenque (Ren 8), Qihai (Ren 6) and Guanyuan (Ren 4) are located on the lower abdomen along the Ren Meridian and are the main points effective for collapse. Heavy moxibustion applied on Guanyuan (Ren 4), a meeting point of the Ren Meridian and three yin meridians, can strengthen the primary qi, and restore yang from collapse.

#### Supplementary Points

**For Upward disturbance of wind yang:**
- [[Fenchi (G 20) (reducing)]]
- [[Taichong (Liv 3) (reducing)]]
- [[Taixi (K 3) (reinforcing)]]
- [[Sanyinjiao (Sp 6) (reinforcing)]]

**For Excessive fire in the heart and liver:**
- [[Daling (P 7) (reducing)]]
- [[Xingjian (Liv 2) (reducing)]]
- [[Taixi (K 3) (reinforcing)]]

**For Deviated mouth:**
- [[Dicang (S 4)]]
- [[Jiache (S 6)]]

#### Explanation
Du Meridian is the sea of all yang meridians. Baihui (Du 20), Fengfu (Du 16) combined with Tongtian (B 7) can eliminate wind and remove obstruction from the meridians and collaterals. Since the yang meridians dominate the exterior of the body and qi, points of the yang meridians are selected to regulate qi and blood of the body and promote smooth circulation in the upper and lower portions of the body. For the upper disturbance of wind yang, Fengchi (G 20) and Taichong (Liv 3) are selected to reduce the wind and pacify the liver. Reinforcing applied to Taixi (K 3) promotes the production of the kidney yin to nourish the liver. Reinforcing applied to Sanyinjiao (Sp 6) nourishes yin and pacifies yang. For excessive fire in the heart and liver, reducing Daling (P 7) and Xingjian (Liv 2) can eliminate the fire, while reinforcing to Taixi (K 3) nourishes yin to reduce the fire. Dicang (S 4) and Jiache (S 6) are selected for the purpose of promoting a free circulation of qi in the meridians and collaterals around the facial region.

## ðŸ“Š Prognosis

In untreated or improperly treated cases, the tense syndrome tends to become flaccid and the prognosis is often poor.
