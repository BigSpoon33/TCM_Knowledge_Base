# ü©∫ Dysmenorrhea

## üìñ Overview

Dysmenorrhea refers to the pain appearing in the lower abdomen and lower back before, after or during menstruation. The pain, sometimes intolerable, occurring during the cycle of menses is known as painful menstruation.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Pain in the lower abdomen and lower back
- Occurs before, after, or during menstruation
- Pain can be intolerable

---

## üè• Western Medicine Correlation

**Modern Diagnosis:**
- Pathological changes of the genitalia
- Endocrinal factors
- Neuropsychiatrical factors

## üß¨ Etiology & Pathogenesis

### Primary Causes
1. Stagnation of the liver qi (Excess syndrome)
2. Affection of external [[cold]] (Excess syndrome)
3. Intake of [[cold]] drinks during menstrual periods (Excess syndrome)
4. Qi and blood deficiency due to weak body-build (Deficiency syndrome)
5. Qi and blood deficiency due to chronic disease (Deficiency syndrome)

### Pathological Mechanism
Dysmenorrhea is principally ascribed to the impeded flow of qi and blood in the uterus. Deficiency or stagnation of qi and blood may cause unsmooth flow of menstruation, leading to disharmony between the Chong and Ren Meridians, stagnation of blood, or deprivation of uterine nourishment, thus resulting in pain.

**Affected Organs:** Uterus, Liver, Chong Meridian, Ren Meridian, Kidney, Spleen, Stomach

## üî¨ Pattern Differentiation

### Pattern 1: Excess syndrome

**Type:** Excess

#### Main Manifestations
- Pain in the lower abdomen, usually starting before menstruation
- Retarded and scanty and dark purple menses with clots
- Distending pain in the lower abdomen, alleviated by passing out the clots
- Distension in the hypochondriac region and breast
- Pain and [[cold]] feeling in the lower abdomen referring to the waist and back, alleviated by warmth
- Scanty dark red menses with clots

**Tongue:** Purplish tongue with purple spots on its edge, or sticky and white tongue coating
**Pulse:** Deep and string-taut pulse

#### TCM Analysis
The depressed liver qi gives rise to the distending pain in the lower abdomen, hypochondriac region and breast, and scanty and impeded menses. Qi stagnation inevitably leads to blood stasis, so the menses appears dark purple with clots. The release of clots helps to weed out a little stagnation, alleviating the pain. Purplish tongue with purple spots on its edge, deep and string-taut pulse are signs of qi stagnation and blood stasis. When the cold and [[damp]] retain in the uterus and surround the blood, there present impeded scanty menses with clots and pain in the lower abdomen. Since the uterus connects with the kidney, severe pain refers to the waist and back. Warmth alleviates the pain for it accelerates the flow of blood. White tongue coating, deep and string-taut pulse are signs of collection of internal cold and [[damp]].

### Pattern 2: Deficiency syndrome

**Type:** Deficiency

#### Main Manifestations
- Dull pain appearing by the end of or after menstruation
- Pain alleviated by warmth and pressure
- Pink, scanty and thin menses
- Aversion to cold
- Cold extremities
- Pale complexion
- Palpitation
- Dizziness

**Pulse:** Thready and weak pulse

#### TCM Analysis
When qi and blood is insufficient the sea of blood is not able to provide enough nutrients to the uterus. This is the cause of dull pain, which can be alleviated by pressure and warmth.

## üíâ Treatment Protocols

### Pattern: Excess syndrome

**Treatment Principle:** Adjust qi activities, invigorate blood flow and restore the functions of meridians. In case of cold syndromes, dissipate cold.

**Needle Technique:** Reducing Method (Acupuncture); Both Acupuncture And Moxibustion (For Cold Syndromes)

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Zhongji (Ren 3)]] | regulates the qi in the Chong and Ren Meridians |
| [[Ciliao (B 32)]] | empirical point for dysmenorrhea |
| [[Hegu (LI 4)]] | regulates qi and blood flow and eliminates pain (paired with Taichong) |
| [[Xuehai (Sp 10)]] | invigorates blood flow and menstruation |
| [[Diji (Sp 8)]] | invigorates blood flow and menstruation (Xi-Cleft Point of Spleen Meridian) |
| [[Taichong (Liv 3)]] | frees the stagnated liver qi (Yuan-Primary Point of the Liver Meridian) |

#### Supplementary Points

**For Distending pain in the lower abdomen:**
- [[Siman (K 14)]]
- [[Shuidao (S 28)]]

**For Pain with cold feeling in the lower abdomen:**
- [[Guilai (S 29)]]
- [[Daju (S 27)]]

#### Explanation
Zhongji (Ren 3) serves to regulate the qi in the Chong and Ren Meridians. When it is applied together with Xuehai (Sp 10), Diji (Sp 8), the Xi-(Cleft) Point of the Spleen Meridian, may invigorate blood flow and menstruation. Taichong (Liv 3), the Yuan-(Primary) Point of the Liver Meridian can free the stagnated liver qi, paired with Hegu (LI 4) can regulate qi and blood flow and eliminate pain. Ciliao (B 32) is an empirical point for dysmenorrhea. For distending pain in the lower abdomen it is used together with Siman (K 14), Shuidao (S 28) to regulate the Chong and Ren Meridians and remove blood stasis and pain. Moxibustion applied to Guilai (S 29) and Daju (S 27) warms up the related meridians and eliminates pain in the lower abdomen. The above points used together are to promote the flow of qi, remove blood stasis, warm up meridians and dissipate cold. Thus dysmenorrhea gets cured when the Chong and Ren Meridians are well adjusted.

### Pattern: Deficiency syndrome

**Treatment Principle:** Regulate qi and blood, warm up and nourish the Chong and Ren Meridians.

**Needle Technique:** Reinforcing Method (Acupuncture); Moxibustion

#### Primary Points

| Point | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Guanyuan (Ren 4)]] | warms up the lower jiao, benefits essence, blood and finally the Chong and Ren Meridians |
| [[Pishu (B 20)]] | tonifies the spleen and stomach, and benefits qi and blood |
| [[Shenshu (B 23)]] | warms up the lower jiao, benefits essence, blood and finally the Chong and Ren Meridians |
| [[Zusanli (S 36)]] | tonifies the spleen and stomach, and benefits qi and blood |
| [[Sanyinjiao (Sp 6)]] | tonifies the spleen and stomach, and benefits qi and blood |

#### Explanation
Guanyuan (Ren 4) is an intersecting point of the three foot-yin meridians. When moxibustion is applied to it and Shenshu (B 23), it may warm up the lower jiao, benefit essence, blood and finally the Chong and Ren Meridians. Pishu (B 20), Zusanli (S 36) and Sanyinjiao (Sp 6) grouped together can tonify the spleen and stomach, and benefit qi and blood. Dysmenorrhea is naturally removed when the uterus is nourished by abundant qi and blood, and the balanced equilibrium of the Chong and Ren Meridians.

## üîç Differential Diagnosis

### vs. Secondary dysmenorrhea
If dysmenorrhea is secondary, treatment should be given to the primary cause, which often involves pathological changes of the genitalia, and relates to endocrinal and neuropsychiatrical factors.

## üìä Prognosis

Dysmenorrhea can be cured when the Chong and Ren Meridians are well adjusted and the uterus is nourished by abundant qi and blood.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Clinical Remarks

This disorder often involves pathological changes of the genitalia, and relates to endocrinal and neuropsychiatrical factors. If dysmenorrhea is secondary, treatment should be given to the primary cause.
